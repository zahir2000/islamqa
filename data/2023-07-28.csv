142697,"We are siblings, one son and three daughters. My mother wants to register her apartment in my brother’s name, and we agreed to that. When he acquires another apartment, which will be less expensive than my mother’s apartment, it will be for us, the daughters. My mother is afraid that she will die with a burden of sin. We have a brother through our father, and my father registered the apartment in my mother’s name a long time ago, but my mother paid for half of the price of the apartment from her own money. Will my half-brother inherit from her?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe basic principle is that it is obligatory to treat children equitably in terms of giving gifts, and it is haram to favour any of them over others, because of the report narrated by Bukhari (2587) and Muslim (1623) from an-Nu‘man ibn Bashir, who said: My father gave me some of his wealth and my mother, ‘Amrah bint Rawahah, said: I will not approve until you ask the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to bear witness. So my father went to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to ask him to bear witness to my gift. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to him: “Have you done this for all your children?” He said: No. He said: “Fear Allah and treat your children equitably.” So my father came back and took back the gift.\nThis applies to gifts from both the father and the mother.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him0 said in al-Mughni (5/389): The prohibition on favouring some children over others applies to the mother just as it applies to the father, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Fear Allah, and treat your children equitably.” And because she is one of the parents, so she is not allowed to favour some of her children over others, as also applies to the father. Moreover, what may result from the father’s favouring some of his children, namely jealousy and enmity, will also result from the mother’s favouring some of her children. Thus it is proven that the same ruling applies to her as to him. End quote.\nHowever, if all the children approve of the gift, and they are adults of sound mind, then that is permissible, because they have the right to do that.\nBased on that, if your sisters are mature and of sound mind, and they consent to giving the apartment to that brother, then there is no blame on the mother for doing that.\nThis applies if all the sisters agreed to completely give up their right to the apartment to their brother. But if the registering [of the apartment] was done for some purpose other than completely giving up their right, and the sisters’ intention was that the apartment should belong to them in the event of their brother moving to another apartment, then we do not advise doing that, unless there is something to guarantee the sisters’ rights in the event of their brother refusing to give up the apartment and move to another apartment. There is a difference between one who willingly gives up something completely, in which case there is no need for guarantees or documentation, and the case when forgoing something is done only on paper, for some purpose, whilst retaining all of one’s rights.\nSecondly:\nThe husband may give his wife whatever he wants of his wealth, and he is not obliged to treat her and her children equally. Whatever he gives to her becomes her property and is added to everything else that she owns, and her heirs inherit it from her.\nThe husband’s son is a stranger to his wife, meaning that he cannot inherit from her so long as there is no other reason based on kinship which would dictate that he inherits from her. Based on that, whatever estate your mother leaves behind will be for her children, and her husband’s son will not inherit anything from her.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/142697/is-it-permissible-for-the-mother-to-register-her-apartment-in-her-sons-name-with-the-consent-of-his-sisters
222344,What is the ruling on putting books on top of the Mushaf?,"['Praise be to Allah.The scholars are unanimously agreed that it is obligatory to protect and respect the Mushaf, and it is prohibited to expose it to mistreatment and mishandling. Undoubtedly respecting and venerating the Mushaf comes under the heading of venerating the symbols of Allah. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{That [is so]. And whoever honors the symbols of Allah - indeed, it is from the piety of hearts}\xa0[al-Hajj 22:32].\nSecondly:\nThere is nothing wrong with putting one Mushaf on top of another. Ibn Hajar al-Haytami (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIt is permissible to put one Mushaf on top of another.\nEnd quote from al-Fatawa al-Hadithiyyah (p. 164).\nAs for putting another book – or books – other than the Mushaf on top of the Mushaf, that is not allowed, and the least that may be said concerning it is that it is disliked (makruh).\nAl-Hakim at-Tirmidhi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nPart of respecting it – meaning the Mushaf – if it is put down, is not leaving it open, and not putting any other books on top of it, so that it will always be on top of other books.\nAl-Bayhaqi (may Allah have mercy on him) said, discussing the etiquette to be observed with the Book of Allah:\n… No other book, no garment nor anything else should be placed on top of the Mushaf, unless there are two Mushafs, one of which is placed on top of the other; that is permissible.""(Shu‘ab al-Iman\xa0 3/329).\nSee also: al-Fatawa al-Hadithiyyah (p. 164).\nShaykh ‘Abd al-Karim al-Khudayr (may Allah preserve him) was asked:\nWhat is the ruling on putting books on top of the Mushaf?\nHe replied:\nThe Qur’an is the word of Allah – this applies to what is between the covers of the Mushaf – and the word of Allah must be respected. It is not permissible to show disrespect to it under any circumstances, and the one who shows disrespect to the Qur’an is in grave danger, because he has shown disrespect to the One Who spoke these words, namely Allah, may He be glorified and exalted.\nIf putting other books on top of the Mushaf was done unintentionally, then the one who forgets or does something by mistake is pardoned.\nIf it was done out of ignorance, the one who is ignorant is also excused.\nBut if it was done knowingly and deliberately, that is not permitted, because it is a type of disrespect.""(Sharh ‘Umdat al-Ahkam\xa035/17).\nIf it appears to be the case, based on the nature of what is placed on top of the Mushaf, that that things was put there to protect it, and the Mushaf is a means of protecting it, or the thing that is placed on top of the Mushaf is something that is usually treated with disrespect, then undoubtedly that is prohibited, because in both of these cases, and similar cases, it is clearly disrespect towards the Book of Allah, and that is undoubtedly haram.\nFor more information, please see the answers to questions no. 95753 and 125930 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/222344/ruling-on-putting-books-on-top-of-the-mushaf
