158939,"In order to attain the qirat of reward, is it stipulated that one should walk with the bier from the house of the deceased to the prayer place, then offer the funeral prayer…?","['Praise be to Allah.What appears to be the case is that the one who offers the funeral prayer, even if he did not come out with the bier from the house of the deceased, will have a qirat of reward, because of the report narrated by Muslim in his Sahih (945) from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), who said: “Whoever offers the funeral prayer and does not follow (the bier) will have one qirat, and whoever follows it will have two qirats.” It was said: What are the two qirats? He said: “The smaller of them is like Uhud.”\nAnd it was narrated from Thawban, the freed slave of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever offers the funeral prayer will have one qirat, and if he attends the burial he will have two qirat, each qirat like Uhud.” Narrated by Muslim (946).\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Following the bier is of three types:\n\nOffering the funeral prayer, then leaving.\nFollowing the bier to the grave, then remaining there until the deceased is buried.\nRemaining for a while after the burial and praying for forgiveness for the deceased.""(Al-Mughni\xa0 2/174).\n\nAl-Bahuti (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Ahmad was asked about someone who comes to the prayer place where funeral prayers are offered, and offers the funeral prayer with those who come. He said: There is nothing wrong with that… It says in al-Furu‘: It is as if he thought that if he followed the bier from the house of the deceased, that would have been better. It says in the hadith of Yahya ibn Ja‘dah: “And follow it from the house of the deceased,” meaning whoever offers the funeral prayer after following the bier from the house of the deceased will have one qirat.""(Daqa’iq Uli’l-Nuha\xa0 1/367).\nAl-Hafiz said in al-Fath: What this implies is that the qirat is only for the one who attends from the beginning until the end of the prayer. This was stated clearly by al-Muhibb al-Tabari and others. What appears to me to be the case is that the qirat may also be attained by one who attends the prayer only, because everything that comes before the prayer is a means that leads to it, but the qirat earned by the one who offers the prayer only will be less than the qirat of the one who walks with the bier, for example, and offers the prayer. The report narrated by Muslim via Abu Salih from Abu Hurayrah, which says “The smaller of them is like Uhud” indicates that the qirats vary. It also says in the report of Abu Salih that is narrated by Muslim: “The one who offers the funeral prayer but does not follow (the bier) will have one qirat.” According to the report narrated by Nafi ibn Jubayr from Abu Hurayrah, which is narrated by Ahmad: “Whoever offers the prayer but does not follow (the bier) will have one qirat.” This indicates that offering the prayer earns the qirat, even if one does not follow (the bier). It may be that what is meant by following (the bier) refers to what comes after the prayer.""(Fath al-Bari\xa0 3/197).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/158939/the-one-who-offers-the-funeral-prayer-will-have-a-qirat-of-reward-even-if-he-does-not-come-out-with-the-bier-from-the-house-of-the-deceased
103880,"Is it permissible to fill in soil directly onto the face of the deceased who is buried in the Shaqq? What is the correct way of doing this (i.e., burying the deceased in the Shaqq) if we are forced to adopt this method of burial?","['Praise be to Allah.What is a Shaqq?\nThe Shaqq refers to a trench that is dug in the middle of the grave to suit the size of the deceased, and its sides are built with bricks so that it will not collapse on the deceased, and the deceased is placed in it on his right side facing the Qiblah, then this trench is covered with stones or the like and the ceiling is raised a little so that it will not touch the deceased, then the soil is filled in.\xa0\nWhat is a Lahd?\nThe Lahd (niche) refers to a place that is dug at the bottom of one of the sides of the grave in the side that is closest to the Qiblah, in which the deceased is placed on his right side facing the Qiblah, then this hole is filled in with bricks behind the deceased, then the dirt is filled in. (See: Ahkam Al-Maqabir fil Shari`ah Al-Islamiyyah, p. 30, by Dr. `Abdullah As-Suhaybani)\xa0\nBoth the Lahd and the Shaqq are permissible according to scholarly consensus, but the Lahd is preferable, because this is what was done with the grave of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).\xa0\nMuslim (966) narrated that Sa`d ibn Abu Waqqas (may Allah be pleased with him) said, during the illness of which he died: Make a Lahd (niche) for me, and set up bricks behind me, as was done for the Messenger of Allah.\xa0\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Mughni (2/188):\xa0\n“The Sunnah is to make a Lahd in the grave, as was done with the grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).”\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Majmu` (2/252):\xa0\n“The scholars unanimously agreed that burial in the Lahd and burial in the Shaqq are both permissible , but if the ground is stable and the soil will not collapse then the Lahd is preferable, but if it is unstable and will collapse, then the Shaqq is preferable.”\nIbn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti` (5/360):\xa0\n“But if there is a need for the Shaqq, then there is nothing wrong with it. The Shaqq may be needed if the ground is sandy and it is not possible to dig a Lahd, because when a Lahd is made in sand it will collapse. So a grave hole should be dug and a trench should be dug in the middle of it, and the bricks should be placed over both sides of the hole in which the deceased is placed, so that the sand will not collapse, then the deceased should be placed between these two bricks.”\nShould soil be filled in directly on the face or body of the deceased?\nThe soil should not be filled directly on the face or body of the deceased, whether the grave is a Lahd or a Shaqq, because in the Lahd the deceased is placed in the niche which is dug in the wall of the grave, and the soil is not filled in above him. In the Shaqq, the soil is filled above the roof of the Shaqq, and not directly on top of the deceased.\xa0\nFor more details, please see the following\xa0 answers: 47902 , 12386 , and 82 .\xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/103880/types-of-graves-in-islam
348292,I've learned that Islam teaches spouses to love one another and be attached to one another after Nikah and stay with each other with tranquility.,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe great selflessness of the Ansar\nAl-Bukhari (3781) narrated from Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn ‘Awf came to us, and the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instituted the bond of brotherhood between him and Sa‘d ibn al-Rabi‘, who was very wealthy. Sa‘d said: The Ansar know that I am one of the wealthiest of them,\xa0so I will divide my wealth equally between me and you. And I have two wives, so see which of them you like better, and I will divorce her so that when she becomes lawful, you may marry her. ‘Abd al-Rahman said: May Allah bless your family for you. [He went to the market to trade] and did not return on that day until he had acquired some gain of ghee and dried yoghurt. [He went on trading] until, within a short time, he came to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) with traces of yellow perfume on him. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to him: “What is this scent?” He said: I have married a woman of the Ansar. He said: “What mahr did you give her?” He said: A date-stone’s weight of gold, or a date-stone of gold. He said: “Give a wedding feast (walimah), even with one sheep.”\nThis is an example of the greatest selflessness, in which a man gives precedence to his brother over himself in that regard. He did not stop at offering to give up one of his wives for him; rather he give him the option of choosing the better one, for he was married to two women, as it was narrated by Ahmad (13863) that Sa‘d said: I have two wives, so see which of them you like best, so that I may divorce her…\nHence Allah praised the Ansar by saying (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And those who were already settled in the land [of Madinah] before them, and were sincere in faith, love the Muhajirun who came to them, and find no covetous desire in their hearts for what they have been given. Rather they give them preference over themselves, even if they too are poor. Those who are protected from their own covetousness – it is they who will be the successful ones}\xa0[al-Hashr 59:9].\nThis selflessness is not something that was found exclusively among the men of the Ansar; rather their women were the same. Undoubtedly Sa‘d ibn al-Rabi‘ (may Allah be pleased with him) knew from the attitude and faith of his wives that they would not object to this selflessness, and would never let him down, and that one of them would leave her husband and marry someone else to fulfil his wish and share with him in the reward and being brought close to Allah.\nSo we should not compare their situation to ours and how stingy we are, for they were far above what we could imagine.\nMoreover, the Arabs did not see anything wrong with that, meaning that a man would divorce his wife, then she would marry someone else. The matter of marriage and divorce was something easy for them.\nSecondly:\nDivorce for no reason and no need is disliked (makruh), and it was said that it is prohibited (haram), but this was a case of great need, which was the need to help the Muhajirin who had been expelled from their land and lost their wealth.\nThirdly:\nA comment on the action of the Sahabi mentioned in this report\nChoosing the wife which he liked best was not something that was limited only to looking at the woman. There are many other factors to be considered when choosing a wife, such as her lineage, her age and whether she has children or not. Moreover, hijab had not yet been enjoined, so it was possible to see her, and it was also possible to find out about her from other women.\nWhat matters is that this did not happen, so there is no need to make assumptions about the way in which the choice was made. Rather what happened is what is recorded in the reports. This is the unique selflessness that Allah instilled in the supporters of His cause and the supporters (Ansar) of His Messenger Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nThere is no need to imagine or assume anything. It is sufficient for us to know that Allah praised these people (the Ansar) and is pleased with them, and that they gave precedence to their brothers over themselves, and their brothers, the Muhajirin, responded by thanking them and refraining from taking them up on such offers.\nWhat the Sahabi suggested did not happen at all, so why do we need to ask this question or to suggest that if that had happened, it would have been something bad or unfair, or to describe it as such and such, when it did not even happen?\nRather we should focus on the point of this story, which is the great selflessness of the companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), their love of good for their brothers, and their being free of stinginess even with regard to that which was most precious to them, namely their wives, so how about other matters?\nMay Allah be pleased with them all, and may He make us among those of whom He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And [there is a share for] those who came after them, saying, “Our Lord, forgive us and our brothers who preceded us in faith and put not in our hearts [any] resentment toward those who have believed. Our Lord, indeed You are Kind and Merciful”}\xa0[al-Hashr 59:10].\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/348292/a-comment-on-confusion-about-the-story-of-sad-ibn-al-rabi-divorcing-his-wife-so-that-abd-al-rahman-ibn-awf-could-marry-her
131777,"What is the duty of a Muslim towards a non-Muslim, whether he is a Dhimmi in a Muslim country or in his own country, and the Muslim is living in the land of that non-Muslim?","['Praise be to Allah.Duties of Muslims towards non-Muslims\nShaykh ‘Abd Al-‘Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“The duty of the Muslim towards a non-Muslim includes a number of things:\xa0\n\nDa`wah or calling him to Allah , may He be Glorified and Exalted. He should explain to him the reality of Islam when possible, with regard to whatever issues the Muslim has knowledge about, because this is the greatest kindness one can give to his fellow-citizens and to those whom he meets of Jews, Christians and others who may be polytheists.\xa0\n\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The one who guides others to goodness will have a reward like that of the one who does it.”\xa0\nHe (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) also said to `Ali (may Allah be pleased with him), when he sent him to Khaybar and instructed him to call the Jews to Islam: “By Allah, if Allah were to guide one man through you, that would be better for you than having red camels (the best kind).” Furthermore, he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever calls others to right guidance will have a reward like that of those who follow him, without that detracting from their reward in the slightest.”\nSo calling the non-Muslim to Islam, conveying Islam to him and being sincere towards him are among the best means of drawing close to Allah.\xa0\n\nThe Muslim should not wrong the non-Muslim, with regard to his physical wellbeing, his wealth or his honour. If he is a Dhimmi (non-Muslim living under Muslim rule), Musta’man (one who is granted security in a Muslim land) or Mu`ahid (one with whose country the Muslims have a peace agreement), then he should give him his due rights, and not transgress against his wealth by stealing, betraying or deceiving, and he should not harm him physically by striking or killing him, because the fact that he is a Mu`ahid or Dhimmi, or Musta’man, means that he is protected by Shari‘ah.\xa0\nThere is no reason why we should not interact with him, buying, selling, renting, hiring and so on. It is narrated in authentic reports that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) bought from the disbelievers who were idol worshippers, and he bought from the Jews, and these are interactions. When he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) died, his shield was being held in pledge by a Jew for some food he had bought for his family (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\xa0\nWith regard to greeting, a Muslim should not initiate the greeting , but he may respond if greeted, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not initiate the greeting of Salam with the Jews or Christians.” And he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If the people of the Book greet you with Salam (by saying Al-salamu ‘alaykum), say ‘Wa ‘alaykum.’” So the Muslim should not initiate the greeting to a disbeliever, but if the disbeliever initiates it, and the Jew or Christians etc. greets you with Salam, then you should say “wa ‘alaykum,” as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said.\xa0\n\nThese are some of the rights between a Muslim and a disbeliever.\xa0\nAnother right is to be a good neighbour. So if he is a neighbour, be kind to him and do not annoy him; give charity to him if he is poor, give him gifts, give him beneficial advice, because these are things that will attract him to Islam and to become Muslim; and because the neighbour has rights.\nThe Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Jibril kept urging me to be kind to my neighbour until I thought that he would make him my heir.” (Al-Bukhari and Muslim)\nIf the neighbour is a disbeliever, he still has the rights of a neighbour; if he is both a relative and a disbeliever, then he has two rights: the right as a neighbour and the right as a relative.\xa0\nOne of the rights of the neighbour is that you should give him charity , but not Zakah, if he is poor, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Allah does not forbid you to deal justly and kindly with those who fought not against you on account of religion nor drove you out of your homes. Verily, Allah loves those who deal with equity.” [Al-Mumtahanah 60:8]\xa0\nAccording to an authentic Hadith narrated from Asma’ bint Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with her), her mother, who was a disbeliever, entered upon her during the truce between the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and the people of Makkah, seeking her help. Asma’ (may Allah be pleased with her) asked the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) for permission - should she uphold ties of kinship with her? The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Uphold ties of kinship with her.”\xa0\nCan Muslims celebrate non-Muslim festivals?\nWith regard to celebrating non-Muslim festivals, the Muslim should not take part in celebrating their festivals , but there is nothing wrong with offering them condolences if a loved one dies, such as saying “May Allah compensate you in your loss” and other kind words. However, he should not say “May Allah forgive him” or “May Allah have mercy on him” if the deceased was a disbeliever, and he should not pray for the deceased if he was a disbeliever. He may pray for the one who is alive to be guided and to be compensated and so on.” (Fatawa Noor ‘ala Ad-Darb, 1/289-291).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/131777/duties-of-muslims-towards-non-muslims
