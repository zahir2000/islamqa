134346,"Recently it has become common practice for the one who loses something to recite Surat al-Duha, and by Allah’s leave he will find what he lost, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {And your Lord is going to give you, and you will be satisfied} [al-Duha 93:5]. But the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not do that, so how should we respond to those who say that?","['Praise be to Allah.Allah has perfected the religion for us, as He, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {This day I have perfected for you your religion and completed My favor upon you and have approved for you Islam as religion} [al-Ma’idah 5:3].\nAnd the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) conveyed it to us in full, so we do not need anyone to add anything to what Allah, may He be exalted, has prescribed for us.\nIf anyone adds to what Allah has prescribed, then he must be one of two things: either he does not believe that Islam is perfect, or he is accusing the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) of having failed to convey the religion to us in full.\nHence al-Shatibi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIslam came perfect, and nothing can be added to it or taken away from it, because Allah, may He be exalted, says regarding it (interpretation of the meaning): {This day I have perfected for you your religion and completed My favor upon you and have approved for you Islam as religion} [al-Ma’idah 5:3].\nAnd it is proven that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not die until he had explained in detail everything that is needed with regard to both religious and worldly matters. None of Ahl al-Sunnah differs regarding this.\nAs that is the case of the one who uses innovation, then what he is saying, implicitly or explicitly, is that Islam is not yet perfect, and that there remain matters which must or should be added, because if he believed that Islam is complete and perfect in every respect, he would not have introduced any innovation or added something to the religion. The one who thinks that is misguided and has gone astray from the straight path.\nIbn al-Majishon said: I heard Malik say: Whoever introduces an innovation into Islam that he thinks is good is claiming that Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) betrayed the message, because Allah may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {This day I have perfected for you your religion} [al-Ma’idah 5:3]. Whatever was not part of the religion on that day cannot be part of it today.""(Al-I‘tisam\xa0 p. 33).\nShaykh Bakr Abu Zayd (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nOne of the innovations is singling something out without evidence, such as singling out a particular verse or a particular surah to be recited at a particular time, or in a particular place, or for a particular need, and so on, singling things out without evidence.\nExamples of that include:\n\nReciting al-Fatihah with the intention of having needs met or being granted relief from hardship.\nReciting Surah Ya-Sin forty times with the intention of having needs met.""(Bida‘ al-Qira’ah\xa0 p. 14-15).\n\nSingling out the recitation of Surat al-Duha when losing something is an innovation that comes under the heading of innovations that are invented by one who does not properly appreciate the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nFor if they had truly appreciated the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), they would not have added anything to what he prescribed for us at all.\nWe ask Allah, may He be exalted, to make us among those who adhere to the practice of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and that of his companions.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/134346/ruling-on-reciting-surat-al-duha-when-one-has-lost-something

They have given him notification that he should resign… And he is the only breadwinner for our family. I would like to learn a supplication (Du`a) that I can recite, so that Allah may grant us relief and we will have more income. I looked on the Internet, and I found a supplication, but I do not know if it is sound, because it asks the individual to recite it twelve thousand times in one sitting.

They include the following:\n\nAhmad (3712) narrated that `Abdullah ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “No person suffers any anxiety or grief , and says: ‘Allahumma inni `abduka wabnu `abdika wabnu amatika, nasiyati bi yadika, madin fiyya hukmuka, `adlun fiyya qada’uka, as’aluka bi kulli ismin huwa laka sammayta bihi nafsaka aw `allamtahu ahadan min khalqika aw anzaltahu fi kitabika aw ista’tharta bihi fi `ilm il-ghaybi `andak an taj`ala Al-Qurana rabi`a qalbi wa nura sadri wa jala’a huzni wa dhahaba hammi (O Allah, I am Your slave, son of Your slave, son of Your female slave, my forelock is in Your hand, Your command over me is forever executed and Your decree over me is just.

He (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Yes indeed; whoever hears them should learn them.”\xa0(Classed as authentic by Al-Albaani in\xa0Sahih At-Targhib wa At-Tarhib, 1822)\nMuslim (2713) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to tell us, when any one of us wanted to lie down and sleep, to say: “Allahumma Rabb As-samawati wa Rabb Al-ardi wa Rabb Al-`Arsh il-`Adhim, Rabbana wa Rabba kulli shay’, faliq Al-habbi wan-nawa wa munzil At-Tawrati wal-Injili wal-Furqan, a`udhu bika min sharri kulli dabbatin anta akhidhun bi nasiyatiha.

O Allah, You are the First and there is nothing before You; You are the Last and there is nothing after You. You are the Manifest and the Most High (Adh-Dhahir) and there is nothing above You; You are the Most Near (Al-Batin) and there is nothing nearer than You.

And if you have debt like the mountain of Sir, Allah will pay it off for you . He said: “Say: Allahumma ikfini bi halalika `an haramika wa aghnini bi fadlika `amman siwaka (O Allah, suffice me with what You have permitted so that I have no need of that which You have forbidden, and make me independent of means by Your bounty so that I have no need of anyone besides You).’”\xa0 (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 3563; classes as sound by Al-Albani in\xa0Sahih At-Tirmidhi)\nAt-Tabarani narrated in\xa0Al-Mu`jam As-Saghir\xa0that Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to Mu`adh (may Allah be pleased with him): ‘Shall I not teach you a Du`a which you may say; even if you have debt like Mount Uhud, Allah might pay it off for you?’ Say, O Mu’adh: ‘Allahumma Malik Al-mulk, tu’ti Al-mulka man tasha’ wa tanzi` Al-mulka mimman tasha’, wa tu`izzu man tasha’ wa tudhillu man tasha’, bi yadika Al-khayr, innaka `ala kulli shay’in qadir, Rahman Ad-dunya wal-akhirati wa rahimahuma, tu‘tihima man tasha’ wa tamna`u minhuma man tasha’, irhamni rahmatan tughnini biha `an rahmati man siwaka (O Allah, Sovereign of all, You give dominion to whomsoever You will and You take dominion away from whomsoever You will, You exalt whomsoever You will and You bring low whomsoever You will.

This also applies to deciding whether a particular act of worship may be done at any time or is limited to a certain time, how it is to be done and how many times it is to be done. With regard to whatever Allah has prescribed of Adhkar, supplication and all other acts of worship that are not limited to a specific time, number, place or manner, it is not permissible for us to commit ourselves to a particular manner, time or number; rather we worship Allah by doing these acts of worship with no restrictions, as they were prescribed. Whatever is proven on the basis of reports which indicate on the basis of the Prophet’s words or deeds that they are limited to a particular time or number, or limited to a particular place or manner, we worship Allah by doing them in accordance with what is proven by the religious texts.” (Shaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn Baz, Shaykh `Abd Ar-Razzaq `Afifi, Shaykh `Abdullah ibn Ghadyan, Shaykh `Abdullah ibn Qa`ud.""

He is Allah [the only God], the Almighty [al-‘Aziz], the Most Wise}\xa0[Saba’ 34:27]\n{The sun is rapidly moving towards its destination.

The king is called by this name because he dominates his subjects.""(Taj al-‘Arus\xa0 15/232).\nAl-‘izzah (might), which is one of the attributes of Allah, has three meanings:\n‘Izzah in the sense that no one can harm Him.\n‘Izzah in the sense of subduing and controlling others.\n‘Izzah in the sense of might and power.\nAll of these attributes belong to Allah, may He be exalted, in the most perfect and complete sense.\nShaykh Muhammad Khalil Harras (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his Sharh:\nAs for the name al-‘Aziz, it refers to the One who possesses the attribute of might, and the author mentioned three meanings for it:\n1. ‘Izzah in the sense that no one can harm Him, so none of His enemies who want to harm Him could do so. Hence their schemes will never reach Him and no one will be able to cause Him harm, as He says in the hadith qudsi: “O My slaves, you can never do Me any harm and you can never bring Me any benefit.” Narrated by Muslim (2577). So no one will ever be able to subdue Him or overcome Him.\n2. ‘Izzah in the sense of subduing and controlling others, meaning that He is the Subduer who controls others.\nSo He, may He be glorified, is the Subduer of His enemies, Who controls and overwhelms them, but they are not able to subdue Him or control Him.\nThis is the sense in which the word al-‘izzah is most often used.\n3. ‘Izzah in the sense of might and power.\nThese three meanings of ‘izzah may all be ascribed to Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, in the most perfect and complete way that is furthest removed from any shortcomings whatsoever.""(Sharh al-Qasidah al-Nuniyyah\xa0 2/79).\nShaykh al-Sa‘di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAl-‘Aziz means the One Who possesses all might: the might of power and strength, the might of control and overcoming, and the might that prevents anyone from harming Him.\nSo it is not possible that any of His creation could harm Him, for He subjugates all that exists and all creation submits to His might.\nThe three meanings of al-‘izzah are all perfect attributes of Allah:\nThe ‘izzah of strength is indicated by His names al-Qawiy al-Matin (the Lord of Might, the Powerful). This is a description of His great characteristics that cannot be compared to the strength of created beings, no matter how powerful they may be.\nThe ‘izzah when means that none can harm him indicates that no one could harm Him, for he is al-Ghaniy bi dhatihi (the Self-Sufficient), who does not need anyone and people cannot harm Him or benefit Him; rather He is the one who causes harm and brings benefit, the one who gives and the one who withholds.\nThe ‘izzah of subjugation and control of all beings. They are all subjugated to Allah, submit to His might and are controlled by His will. All forelocks are in His hand, and none of them can move or do anything except by His power, strength and permission. Whatever Allah wills happens and whatever He does not will does not happen, and there is no power and no strength except with Him.""(Tafsir Asma’ Allah al-Husna\xa0 p. 214).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/288103/the-meaning-of-allahs-name-al-aziz
21216,I want to know how the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to sleep. Did he sleep on a bed or on the floor? Did he used to recite a specific Du`a when he wanted to sleep?,"['Praise be to Allah.Did the Prophet sleep on the floor?\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to sleep sometimes on a mattress, sometimes on a leather mat, sometimes on a mat made of palm leaves, sometimes on the floor, sometimes on a bed, sometimes on the sand, and sometimes on a black cloak.\xa0\n`Abbad ibn Tamim (may Allah have mercy on him) said, narrating from his paternal uncles: I saw the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) lying on his back in the mosque, putting one leg on top of the other. (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 475; Muslim, 2100)\xa0\nHis mattress was made of leather stuffed with palm fibres, and he had a coarse woollen cloth that he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would fold over twice and sleep on.\xa0\nThe point is that he slept on a mattress and covered himself with a blanket. He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to his wives: “Jibril never came to me whilst I was under the blanket of any one of you apart from `Aishah.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 3775)\nHis pillow was also leather stuffed with palm fibres.\xa0\nDu`a before sleeping\nWhen he went to bed to sleep, he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would say : “Allahumma bismika ahya wa amut (O Allah, in Your name I live and die).” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 7394)\xa0\nHe (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to put his hands together and blow into them, then recite Qul Huwa Allahu ahad , Qul a’udhu bi Rabb il-Falaq and Qul a’udhu bi Rabb in-Nas [i.e., the last three surahs of the Quran), then he would wipe his hands over as much of his body as he could, starting with his head and face, and the front part of his body. He would do that three times.\xa0\nWhich side did the Prophet sleep on?\nHe (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to sleep on his right side , putting his right hand under his right cheek, then he would say: “Allahumma qini ‘adhabaka yawma tab’ath ‘ibadaka (O Allah, protect me from Your punishment on the Day You resurrect Your slaves).”\xa0\nWhen he went to bed he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to say: “Al-hamdu Lillah alladhi at’amana wa saqana wa kafana wa awana, fakam mimman la kaafi lahu wa la mu’wi (All praise is for Allah, Who fed us and gave us to drink, and Who is sufficient for us and has sheltered us, for how many have none to suffice them or shelter them).”\xa0\nThis was narrated by Muslim, who also narrated that he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to say when he went to bed:\xa0\n“Allahumma Rabb As-samawati wa’l-ard wa Rabb Al-‘arsh il-‘athim, Rabbana wa Rabba kulli shay’in, Faliq Al-habb wa’n-nawa wa munzil Al-Tawrati wa’l-Injili wa’l-Furqan, a’udhu bika min sharri kulli shay’in anta akhidhun bi nasiyatihi.

You are my God and there is no god worthy of worship but You).” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 1120)\xa0\nProphet Muhammad’s sleep routine\nHe (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to sleep during the first part of the night and get up to pray during the last part. Sometimes he would stay up late to deal with the interests of the Muslims. His eyes slept but his heart did not. When he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) slept, they (his family) would not wake him up; he would be the one to wake up.\nWhen he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stopped to rest at night during a journey, he would lie down on his right side, and if he stopped to rest just before dawn he would prop his head up on his forearm, resting it in his palm. This was narrated by At-Tirmidhi.\xa0\nHow many hours did the Prophet sleep?\nProphet Muhammad’s sleep \xa0(peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was of the best length and it was the most beneficial of sleep. The doctors say that it is one-third of the night and day, namely eight hours.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21216/how-did-prophet-muhammad-sleep
