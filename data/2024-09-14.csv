Is there any sin on me for being in a place where there is alcohol? Please note that I am very careful not to sit near it and I do not drink it, praise be to Allah.","['Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to sit with people who are drinking alcohol unless you object to that; if they accept that, all well and good, otherwise you must leave them, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day, let him not sit at a table where alcohol is passed around.” (Narrated by Imam Ahmad and At-Tirmidhi with a sound Isnad (chain of narration)). And because sitting with them is a means that may lead to joining them in their bad deed or approving of it. Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, says in Surat Al-An`am (interpretation of the meaning): {And when you see those who engage in [offensive] discourse concerning Our verses, then turn away from them until they enter into another conversion. And if Satan should cause you to forget, then do not remain after the reminder with the wrongdoing people} [Al-An`am 6:68]. And He, when He be glorified and exalted, says: {And it has already come down to you in the Book that when you hear the verses of Allah [recited], they are denied [by them] and ridiculed; so do not sit with them until they enter into another conversation. Indeed, you would then be like them} [An-Nisa’ 4:140].\nAnd Allah is the source of strength.\n(End quote from Majmu` Fatawa Ibn Baz, 23/60).']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/127981/prohibition-on-sitting-at-tables-where-alcohol-is-drunk
138451,"What is the ruling on sex change operations (gender reassignment surgery) in the case of necessity? For example, if a child is born and has genitalia that does not match his gender, and it is possible to surgically reconstruct it? What is the ruling if this child grows up and becomes transgendered, and thus cannot get married, and this is on the basis of medical evidence on which the doctors agree, but social standards reject this surgery, and this sex-change operation is for the sake of medical treatment?","['Praise be to Allah.The Immutable Creation of Allah\n\xa0It is not possible for anyone, no matter who he is, to change the creation of Allah , may He be Exalted, from male to female or vice versa. Whoever Allah, may He be Exalted, has created as a male can never become a female who menstruates and gives birth!\xa0\nYes, the doctors may tamper with him to satisfy his perversion so that he will think that he has become a woman, but he will never be truly female and will live in a state of anxiety and worry, which may lead him to commit suicide.\xa0\nFollowing the Devil in Changing the Creation of Allah\xa0\nWhat a person may feel in his mind and heart, that he is of a gender other than what he appears to be to us does not give him an excuse to change his gender ; rather it comes under the heading of following the devil in changing the creation of Allah – outwardly but not truly – and those feelings do not make it permissible for him to undergo surgery or take medicines and hormones to change his outward appearance. Rather he must be content with the decree of Allah, may He be Exalted, and treat his case on the basis of faith and obedience to Allah. It is not permissible for him to make himself appear outwardly to be of a gender other than his real gender with which Allah created him, otherwise he will be committing a major sin; if this person is really female then she will be masculinised and if he is really male then he will be effeminate.\xa0\nIs sex correction surgery allowed in Islam?\nThe surgery that is permissible in such cases is if a person was originally created male or female, but his genital organs are hidden. In that case it is permissible to do surgery in order to make those organs appear, and to give him or her medicine or hormones to strengthen the characteristics with which Allah originally created him or her.\xa0\nBut in the case of one who was created with both female and male genitalia – this is what is called ambiguous intersex – it is not permissible to be hasty in removing one and making the other more apparent. Rather we should wait until it is known what Allah, may He be Exalted, will decree for this individual, which may become apparent after some time has passed.\xa0\nFor a more detailed discussion on intersex, please see the answer to question no.\xa0114670 \xa0\nIs It Prohibited to Change Your Gender?\nThere follows a detailed fatwa from the scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas, who were asked about a case similar to what is mentioned in the question.\xa0\nThey replied:\xa0\n\nFirstly: Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {To Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He creates what He wills. He bestows female (offspring) upon whom He wills, and bestows male (offspring) upon whom He wills. Or He bestows both males and females, and He renders barren whom He wills. Verily, He is the All-Knower and is Able to do all things.} [Ash-Shura 42:49]. So the Muslim must accept and be content with whatever Allah creates and decrees.\xa0\n\nIn your case, if you are as you mentioned, that you are certain of your masculinity and that you can play the male role efficiently, even if you have not actually engaged in any sexual activity with any person, then you must preserve your masculinity and accept that which Allah has granted to you of virtue and a favourable situation. .\xa0\n\nSecondly: once your masculinity is proven and established, then having surgery to turn into a female – as you think – is changing the creation of Allah, and is an expression of discontent on your part with what Allah has chosen for you, even if we assume that the surgery is going to be successful and lead to what you want of becoming female. But there is no way that it can be successful, for both males and females have their own, distinct faculties and physical makeup, the development and characteristics of which are decreed only by Allah, may He be Exalted, and are not just the penis of the male or the vaginal opening of the female. Rather the man has a complete, integrated system comprising the testicles and other organs, each of which has a special function and characteristics, and produces specific secretions and so on. Likewise the woman has a uterus and other connected parts that work in harmony with it, and each part has its own function and characteristics, and produces specific secretions and so on. Among all of them there are connections and harmony over which none of His creation have any power of estimation, creation, control, management or preservation. Rather all of that is under the control of Allah, the All-Knowing, Most Wise, Most High, Almighty, Most Kind and All-Aware.\xa0\n\nTherefore the surgery that you want to do is a kind of tampering and striving for something in which there is no benefit. In fact it may be dangerous; if it does not lead to death, then at the very least it will lead to taking away that which Allah has given you without you attaining what you want, and you will still be affected by what you have mentioned of psychological problems that you want to get rid of by means of this surgery that is bound to fail.\xa0\n\nThirdly: if your masculinity is not established, and you only think that you are a man because of what you see in your body of outward masculine appearance, in contrast to what you feel in yourself of having feminine characteristics and an inclination towards males and being sexually attracted to them, then you should examine your situation and not go ahead with the surgery that you have mentioned. You should consult experienced specialist doctors. If they determine that you are male in outward appearance but are in fact female, then you may submit yourself to their treatment, so that they can bring out your femininity by doing surgery. But that will not in fact be a sex change from male to female, because this will not be up to them; rather it will be bringing out your true nature and removing what is in your body, and what you feel deep inside you of confusion and ambiguity. But if nothing is clear to the experts, then do not take the risk of undergoing this surgery; be content with the decree of Allah and be patient with what has befallen you, seeking to please your Lord and protecting yourself against the possible consequences of doing an operation without guidance and insight concerning your condition. Turn to Allah and beseech Him to relieve you of what you are facing, and to heal you from your psychological problems, for control of all things is in His hand, may He be Glorified, and He is able to do all things.

510163,"What are the types of impurity (Najasah)? Give me examples for each of them, and what is required to cleanse each of them.","['Praise be to Allah.This question has requires a lengthy and detailed answer. The jurists have written entire, lengthy chapters which take up dozens of pages. But we will tell you about the types of impurity and how to clean each type in brief, and we will recommend to you some trustworthy sources in which you can find the details of what you have asked about, with evidence.\nFirstly:\nTypes of impurity (Najasah):\nImpurity is of two types: that which is impure in and of itself and that which is deemed to be impure.\n1.. That which is impure in and of itself: meaning that the essence of the thing is impure, such as faeces, urine, blood, the saliva of a dog; and wine (alcohol) according to most of the scholars. What is meant is that the thing itself is impure.\nThis type cannot be purified by washing with water, but if it is transformed into another substance, it becomes pure through that transformation, such as wine that turns into vinegar.\n2.. That which is deemed to be impure, which is when the impurity comes into contact with something that is pure, such as when urine or blood gets onto clothing that is pure. This type of impurity is called temporary, or is deemed to be impure. This is what can be purified by washing it.\nSecondly:\nThe most common temporary impurities that get onto pure things which then need to be purified are:\n\nHuman urine and stools\nThe urine and stools of animals that cannot be eaten\nMadhi (prostatic fluid)\nWadi (thick, white liquid that comes out after urinating)\nBlood poured forth, which is the blood that flows when an animal is slaughtered\nThe blood of menses, postpartum bleeding (Nifas) and irregular bleeding (Istihadah)\nThe saliva of a dog\nWine (alcohol), according to most of the scholars.\n\nThirdly:\nIn terms of severity, impurity (Najasah) may be divided into three categories:\n\nLesser impurity, such as the urine of an infant boy who is not yet eating solid food, if it gets onto clothes and the like.\n\nThe way to purify it is to sprinkle water on it until it covers the entire area. This applies only to the urine of a baby boy. As for the urine of a baby girl, it must be washed and it is not sufficient to sprinkle it.\n\nIntermediate impurity, such as human urine and stools, and the blood of menses and postpartum bleeding. Most impurities are of this type.\n\nThe way to purify them is to wash the affected item with water until the impurity disappears. If it has any solid substance, that must be removed before washing it, and it does not matter if the colour remains after washing it.\niii. Greater impurity, which is the saliva of a dog.\nThe way to purify it is to wash what the dog licked seven times, the first of which must be with earth.\nFourthly:\nHow to purify impurities.\nThe things that impurities get onto are of four types:\n\nThe ground. If the impurity falls onto dirt or paved ground, then if it has a substance, as in the case of faeces, it must be removed first, then water should be poured on that place until the traces disappear, or it may be buried in clean earth if there is no water.\n\nIf it is urine, then water should be poured on the place until all traces of the impurity disappear.\n\nWater. If the impurity falls into water, then the way to purify it is by eliminating the impurity from the water until no trace of it remains in its colour, taste or smell.\n\nThat may be done either by removing the water, or if the water changes by itself, or a lot of water is added to it, or it is cleaned by modern methods, until all traces of the impurity disappear.\n\nClothing and furnishings. If the impurity gets onto clothing or furnishings, they must be washed with water or pure detergents, and they should be rubbed, wrung out and dried until all traces of the impurity disappear. Shoes and Khuffs that are contaminated with impurity may be purified by rubbing them on the ground until all traces of the impurity disappear.\nVessels. If impurity gets into a vessel, it should be washed with water or pure detergents until all traces of the impurity disappear.\n\nFor more details and evidence regarding what has been mentioned above, please see: Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti` by Shaykh Al-`Uthaymin (1/414); Mawsu`at Al-Fiqh Al-Islami by At-Tuwaijri (2/327); Al-Fiqh Al-Islami wa Adillatuhu by Az-Zuhayli (1/301); and Risalah fil-Fiqh Al-Muyassar by Shaykh Salih As-Sadlan (p. 26-28).\nYou may also refer to some reliable websites and books in English in which you can find more details about the issues of impurity and how to purify things on this link and this link.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/510163/impurity-najasah-its-types-and-how-to-purify-things
161222,"Why is it not permissible for a Muslim to make Salat in a room that has symbols of Idolatry on the walls (Christmas wreaths, etc)?","['Praise be to Allah.Can you pray in a room with pictures?\nThe scholars unanimously agreed that it is not allowed to pray in a place in which there are images of animate beings. In fact some of them were of the view that doing so is prohibited, although the view of the majority is that it is disliked.\xa0\nImam An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“As for fabric on which there are images or crossed lines or anything that distracts the worshipper, it is disliked to pray in it, facing towards it or on it.” (Al-Majmu`, 3/185)\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Tayimiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“The correct view, which was narrated from `Umar ibn Al-Khattab and others, and is mentioned in reports from Ahmad and others, is that if there are images in it (the church), he should not pray there, because the angels do not enter the room in which there are images, and because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not enter the Ka`bah until the images that were in it had been erased. This is what `Umar said: We would not enter their churches if there were images in them.” (End quote from Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 22/162)\xa0\nAl-Bahuti Al-Hanbali (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“It is disliked to pray facing towards a set-up image, as was stated, because it is similar to the disbelievers’ prostrating to them (images). … In Al-Fusul it says: It is disliked to pray facing a wall on which there are pictures and images, because that is similar to the worship of idols and statues.” (End quote from Kashshaf Al-Qina`, 1/370)\nThe scholars of the Standing Committee said:\xa0\n“Praying in a place in which there is an image in front of the ones who are praying is resembling the worshippers of idols, and there are many Haiths which indicate that it is forbidden to resemble the enemies of Allah and that we are enjoined to differ from them. It should also be noted that putting pictures of animate beings on walls is something that is not permissible; rather it is something that leads to exaggeration and shirk, especially if they are images of people who are venerated.” (End quote from Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 6/250-251, `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn Baz, `Abd Ar-Razzaq `Afifi, `Abdullah ibn Ghadyan, `Abdullah ibn Qa`ud)\xa0\nThe later Hanafi and Shafi`i scholars – unlike the Hanbalis – were so strict that they even forbade praying in a place in which there are any images, even if they are behind the one who is praying or placed on the ground so that he cannot see them.\xa0\nAsh-Shibramalsi Ash-Shafi`i (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“It is disliked to pray in a garment on which there is an image , or on a cloth on which there is an image , even if one is blind or it is dark, or the image is behind his back or placed face downwards on the ground so that he cannot see it when he prays on it (the cloth) . This is clear, so as to keep away from the image which is forbidden.” (End quote from Hashiyat Nihayat Al-Muhtaj, 2/14)\xa0\nThe wisdom behind forbidding prayer in a place with images and statues.\nFrom the comments quoted above we may find out and understand the wisdom behind not allowing prayer in a place in which there are images and statues . These reasons are:\xa0\nThe angels do not enter a room where there is an image. It was narrated from Abu Talhah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The angels do not enter a room in which there is a dog or an image.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 3225 and Muslim, 2106)\xa0\nThe worshipper is asking Allah to send down mercy and increase blessings; how could you ask for that in a place where the angels of mercy will not enter?\xa0\n\nAvoiding any resemblance to those who worship idols and statues, namely the idolaters, or even the Christians, who fill their churches with images of Christ and his mother Mary (peace be upon them) on the basis of falsehood. Avoiding any imitations of the non-Muslims is one of the important teachings of Shari`ah, so as to prevent the identity of the Muslims from being assimilated and lost, and so as to preserve its bright light which shines forth among the nations.\xa0\n\nIt was narrated from `A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that Umm Habibah and Umm Salamah mentioned a church that they had seen in Abyssinia in which there were images, to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Those people, if there was a righteous man among them and he died, they would build a place of worship over his grave and put those images in it. They will be the most evil of mankind before Allah on the Day of Resurrection.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 427 and Muslim, 528)\xa0\n\nAvoiding that which may distract the worshipper. If an image is in front of one who is praying, it may distract him and cause his mind to wander, when the Muslim should seek to attain the highest degree of focus and humility when standing before Allah, may He be exalted, in his prayer.\xa0\n\nIt was narrated that Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: `A’ishah had a patterned curtain with which she covered the side of her house. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Take this patterned curtain of yours away from us because its images kept distracting me in my prayer.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 374, in Bab Kirahiyyat As-Salah fil Tasawir)\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/161222/can-you-pray-in-a-room-with-pictures
