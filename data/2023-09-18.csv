314410,What is the ruling on calling food (and things in general) by one of the names of Allah? “Haleem” is a kind of food that is popular in India and Pakistan.,"['Praise be to Allah.The names of Allah, may He be exalted, are of two types:\nThe first type is names that are exclusive to Him, may He be glorified, such as: Allah, ar-Rahman (the Most Gracious), ar-Rabb (the Lord), al-Ahad (the One), and so on. It is not permissible to call anything or anyone by these names, because that is like competing or disputing with Allah, may He be exalted, regarding something that is unique to Him alone.\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAmong the names that are not permissible to use for people are the names of the Lord, may He be blessed and exalted. Therefore it is not permissible for a person to be called al-Ahad (the One), as-Samad (the Eternal Refuge), al-Khaliq (the Creator), ar-Raziq (the Provider), or any of the other names which belong exclusively to the Lord, may He be blessed and exalted. And it is not permissible for kings to be called al-Qahir (the Subduer) or az-Zahir (the Prevailing), or to be called al-Jabbar (the Compeller), al-Mutakabbir (the Supreme), al-Awwal (the First), al-Akhir (the Last), al-Batin (the Most Near), ‘Allam al-Ghuyub (Knower of the unseen).""(Tuhfat al-Mawdud\xa0 p. 125).\nThe second type are names which are shared, so there is nothing wrong with calling people or things by them, such as Karim (noble or generous), Halim (or Haleem – forbearing)), Rahim (merciful), Hakim (wise), ‘Alim (knowing), and so on.\nAllah, may He be exalted, said regarding Ibrahim and his son Isma‘il (peace be upon them both) (interpretation and meaning):\n{So We gave him good tidings of a forbearing boy}\xa0[As-Saffat 37:101].\nThere were among the Companions some who had such names, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not change those names, such as ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib and Hakim ibn Hizam (may Allah be pleased with them both).\nIt says in the commentary on the book Asna al-‘Matalib Sharh Rawd at-Talib (4/243), which is a Shafa‘i book:\nIt is permissible to call people and things by names of Allah, may He be exalted, which are not unique to Him. As for those which are unique to Him, it is haram to do that. An-Nawawi stated that clearly in Sharh Muslim. End quote.\nBased on that, there is nothing wrong with calling some type of food “haleem”, because this is one of the names that are shared, and it is not a name that belongs exclusively to Allah, may He be exalted.\nMoreover, giving a name such as this to this type of food is like a metaphor, and there is no reason to think that it is sharing a name with Allah, may He be exalted.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/314410/is-it-permissible-to-call-something-haleem
409981,"I put on a Holter monitor to monitor heart activity. One of the conditions is that the one who wears it cannot take a bath for two days, so that the monitor will not be damaged. Then I became junub, so I did tayammum instead of ghusl, and I did wudu’ and prayed. Is what I did correct? If it was wrong, what must I do now?","['Praise be to Allah.What is required when doing ghusl is to make the water reach all parts of the body. If a person is wearing a Holter to monitor heart activity and will be harmed if he takes it off – because he has to wear it for a specific time period – and the monitor will be damaged if water gets onto it:\nthen the right way to deal with that is to wrap the area where the Holter is with something waterproof, if that is possible, then wash the rest of the body, and do tayammum for the part that water did not reach.\nThis is by analogy with what the jurists mentioned regarding one who has a wound and is not able to wash the wound or wipe over it, and there is no plaster cast over it. He should do tayammum for the part where the wound is, and wash the rest of his body.\nIt says in Kashshaf al-Qina‘ (1/165): If part of his body is injured and the like, such as if he has a sore, that will be harmed if he washes it or wipes over it with water, then he should do tayammum for that wound or whatever, because of what is noted above, and he should also do tayammum for the part that could be harmed by washing, namely the area near the wound or whatever, because it comes under the same ruling. End quote.\nIf it is not possible to prevent water reaching the Holter, and it is not possible to prevent damaging it, he may do tayammum for the part where the Holter is, where he cannot make water reach it, and wash the rest of his body.\nIt says in Zad al-Mustaqni‘: One who is wounded may do tayammum for the site of the wound, and wash the rest of his body. End quote.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If there is a wound in one of the parts of the body that are to be washed when purifying oneself, then wounds are of different levels:\n1. If the wound is uncovered and will not be harmed by washing. In this case, it must be washed if it is in a part of the body that is to be washed when purifying oneself.\n2. If it is uncovered but would be harmed by washing, but not by wiping, then in this case it must be wiped over and not washed.\n3. If it is covered and will be harmed by washing and wiping, then in this case tayammum must be done.\n4. If it is covered with a dressing or the like that is necessary, in this case the dressing may be wiped over; that will suffice instead of washing that part, and tayammum is not to be done.""(Arkan al-Islam, p. 234).\nBased on that, doing tayammum only was not correct, and you must repeat your ghusl. To be on the safe side, you should also repeat any prayers that you offered after doing that tayammum.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/409981/how-can-he-do-ghusl-whilst-wearing-a-holter-monitor-to-monitor-heart-activity
