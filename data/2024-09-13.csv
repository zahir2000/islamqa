510163,"What are the types of impurity (Najasah)? Give me examples for each of them, and what is required to cleanse each of them.","['Praise be to Allah.This question has requires a lengthy and detailed answer. The jurists have written entire, lengthy chapters which take up dozens of pages. But we will tell you about the types of impurity and how to clean each type in brief, and we will recommend to you some trustworthy sources in which you can find the details of what you have asked about, with evidence.\nFirstly:\nTypes of impurity (Najasah):\nImpurity is of two types: that which is impure in and of itself and that which is deemed to be impure.\n1.. That which is impure in and of itself: meaning that the essence of the thing is impure, such as faeces, urine, blood, the saliva of a dog; and wine (alcohol) according to most of the scholars. What is meant is that the thing itself is impure.\nThis type cannot be purified by washing with water, but if it is transformed into another substance, it becomes pure through that transformation, such as wine that turns into vinegar.\n2.. That which is deemed to be impure, which is when the impurity comes into contact with something that is pure, such as when urine or blood gets onto clothing that is pure. This type of impurity is called temporary, or is deemed to be impure. This is what can be purified by washing it.\nSecondly:\nThe most common temporary impurities that get onto pure things which then need to be purified are:\n\nHuman urine and stools\nThe urine and stools of animals that cannot be eaten\nMadhi (prostatic fluid)\nWadi (thick, white liquid that comes out after urinating)\nBlood poured forth, which is the blood that flows when an animal is slaughtered\nThe blood of menses, postpartum bleeding (Nifas) and irregular bleeding (Istihadah)\nThe saliva of a dog\nWine (alcohol), according to most of the scholars.\n\nThirdly:\nIn terms of severity, impurity (Najasah) may be divided into three categories:\n\nLesser impurity, such as the urine of an infant boy who is not yet eating solid food, if it gets onto clothes and the like.\n\nThe way to purify it is to sprinkle water on it until it covers the entire area. This applies only to the urine of a baby boy. As for the urine of a baby girl, it must be washed and it is not sufficient to sprinkle it.\n\nIntermediate impurity, such as human urine and stools, and the blood of menses and postpartum bleeding. Most impurities are of this type.\n\nThe way to purify them is to wash the affected item with water until the impurity disappears. If it has any solid substance, that must be removed before washing it, and it does not matter if the colour remains after washing it.\niii. Greater impurity, which is the saliva of a dog.\nThe way to purify it is to wash what the dog licked seven times, the first of which must be with earth.\nFourthly:\nHow to purify impurities.\nThe things that impurities get onto are of four types:\n\nThe ground. If the impurity falls onto dirt or paved ground, then if it has a substance, as in the case of faeces, it must be removed first, then water should be poured on that place until the traces disappear, or it may be buried in clean earth if there is no water.\n\nIf it is urine, then water should be poured on the place until all traces of the impurity disappear.\n\nWater. If the impurity falls into water, then the way to purify it is by eliminating the impurity from the water until no trace of it remains in its colour, taste or smell.\n\nThat may be done either by removing the water, or if the water changes by itself, or a lot of water is added to it, or it is cleaned by modern methods, until all traces of the impurity disappear.\n\nClothing and furnishings. If the impurity gets onto clothing or furnishings, they must be washed with water or pure detergents, and they should be rubbed, wrung out and dried until all traces of the impurity disappear. Shoes and Khuffs that are contaminated with impurity may be purified by rubbing them on the ground until all traces of the impurity disappear.\nVessels. If impurity gets into a vessel, it should be washed with water or pure detergents until all traces of the impurity disappear.\n\nFor more details and evidence regarding what has been mentioned above, please see: Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti` by Shaykh Al-`Uthaymin (1/414); Mawsu`at Al-Fiqh Al-Islami by At-Tuwaijri (2/327); Al-Fiqh Al-Islami wa Adillatuhu by Az-Zuhayli (1/301); and Risalah fil-Fiqh Al-Muyassar by Shaykh Salih As-Sadlan (p. 26-28).\nYou may also refer to some reliable websites and books in English in which you can find more details about the issues of impurity and how to purify things on this link and this link.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/510163/impurity-najasah-its-types-and-how-to-purify-things
161222,"Why is it not permissible for a Muslim to make Salat in a room that has symbols of Idolatry on the walls (Christmas wreaths, etc)?","['Praise be to Allah.Can you pray in a room with pictures?\nThe scholars unanimously agreed that it is not allowed to pray in a place in which there are images of animate beings. In fact some of them were of the view that doing so is prohibited, although the view of the majority is that it is disliked.\xa0\nImam An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“As for fabric on which there are images or crossed lines or anything that distracts the worshipper, it is disliked to pray in it, facing towards it or on it.” (Al-Majmu`, 3/185)\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Tayimiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“The correct view, which was narrated from `Umar ibn Al-Khattab and others, and is mentioned in reports from Ahmad and others, is that if there are images in it (the church), he should not pray there, because the angels do not enter the room in which there are images, and because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not enter the Ka`bah until the images that were in it had been erased. This is what `Umar said: We would not enter their churches if there were images in them.” (End quote from Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 22/162)\xa0\nAl-Bahuti Al-Hanbali (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“It is disliked to pray facing towards a set-up image, as was stated, because it is similar to the disbelievers’ prostrating to them (images). … In Al-Fusul it says: It is disliked to pray facing a wall on which there are pictures and images, because that is similar to the worship of idols and statues.” (End quote from Kashshaf Al-Qina`, 1/370)\nThe scholars of the Standing Committee said:\xa0\n“Praying in a place in which there is an image in front of the ones who are praying is resembling the worshippers of idols, and there are many Haiths which indicate that it is forbidden to resemble the enemies of Allah and that we are enjoined to differ from them. It should also be noted that putting pictures of animate beings on walls is something that is not permissible; rather it is something that leads to exaggeration and shirk, especially if they are images of people who are venerated.” (End quote from Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 6/250-251, `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn Baz, `Abd Ar-Razzaq `Afifi, `Abdullah ibn Ghadyan, `Abdullah ibn Qa`ud)\xa0\nThe later Hanafi and Shafi`i scholars – unlike the Hanbalis – were so strict that they even forbade praying in a place in which there are any images, even if they are behind the one who is praying or placed on the ground so that he cannot see them.\xa0\nAsh-Shibramalsi Ash-Shafi`i (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“It is disliked to pray in a garment on which there is an image , or on a cloth on which there is an image , even if one is blind or it is dark, or the image is behind his back or placed face downwards on the ground so that he cannot see it when he prays on it (the cloth) . This is clear, so as to keep away from the image which is forbidden.” (End quote from Hashiyat Nihayat Al-Muhtaj, 2/14)\xa0\nThe wisdom behind forbidding prayer in a place with images and statues.\nFrom the comments quoted above we may find out and understand the wisdom behind not allowing prayer in a place in which there are images and statues . These reasons are:\xa0\nThe angels do not enter a room where there is an image. It was narrated from Abu Talhah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The angels do not enter a room in which there is a dog or an image.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 3225 and Muslim, 2106)\xa0\nThe worshipper is asking Allah to send down mercy and increase blessings; how could you ask for that in a place where the angels of mercy will not enter?\xa0\n\nAvoiding any resemblance to those who worship idols and statues, namely the idolaters, or even the Christians, who fill their churches with images of Christ and his mother Mary (peace be upon them) on the basis of falsehood. Avoiding any imitations of the non-Muslims is one of the important teachings of Shari`ah, so as to prevent the identity of the Muslims from being assimilated and lost, and so as to preserve its bright light which shines forth among the nations.\xa0\n\nIt was narrated from `A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that Umm Habibah and Umm Salamah mentioned a church that they had seen in Abyssinia in which there were images, to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Those people, if there was a righteous man among them and he died, they would build a place of worship over his grave and put those images in it. They will be the most evil of mankind before Allah on the Day of Resurrection.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 427 and Muslim, 528)\xa0\n\nAvoiding that which may distract the worshipper. If an image is in front of one who is praying, it may distract him and cause his mind to wander, when the Muslim should seek to attain the highest degree of focus and humility when standing before Allah, may He be exalted, in his prayer.\xa0\n\nIt was narrated that Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: `A’ishah had a patterned curtain with which she covered the side of her house. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Take this patterned curtain of yours away from us because its images kept distracting me in my prayer.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 374, in Bab Kirahiyyat As-Salah fil Tasawir)\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/161222/can-you-pray-in-a-room-with-pictures
508137,,"['Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with topping up the balance on your phone for more than its price, such as if you load it with 100 rubles for a cost of 107 rubles, because what is meant by credit in this case is minutes of talk or units that cover talk and Internet; it is not money, such that it would be stipulated that the same value be exchanged on the spot.\nRegarding the terminal, if the telecommunication company is selling a permissible service, there is nothing wrong with selling it for more than the original price, or selling it for payment by instalments at a price that is higher than the price if it is paid immediately.\nBut if it is a bank or an intermediary, then it has bought the service from the telecommunication company, and is selling it and making a profit from it.\nIt says in Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah (11/45):\nQuestion: There are now prepaid phone cards which are called Zajul cards. It has become common for shops to buy these cards from the Saudi Telecommunication Company, for example, for a price of fifty riyals, then they sell them for fifty-three riyals, even though the purchaser will only have fifty riyals’ worth of connection. What is the ruling on the storekeeper charging the three extra riyals, or more or less than that? Similarly, there are cards for calling from phone boxes for international calls, for which the company reduces the price by one or two riyals for a customer who takes a number of these cards, so that the one who buys them in quantity will benefit from that, and will receive them for less than their original value. Do you think there is anything wrong with that?\nAnswer: There is nothing wrong with buying and selling this type of phone cards, because in fact it is selling a permissible, useful service.\nAnd Allah is the source of strength.

323262,"Is it proven that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) gave any gift to any of his wives, or is it proven that any of the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) gave any gift to his wife? I hope that the answer will be supported with evidence from the religious texts.","['Praise be to Allah.Gifts in the Life of the Prophet\nWe have not come across many examples of a man giving a gift to his wife at the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Perhaps the reason for that is that gifts would be mixed with maintenance [as it is the man’s responsibility to spend on his wife], or because of the situation of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them), because they lived an austere life and did not accumulate a great deal of worldly wealth as the people who came after them, and as is the case nowadays.\nThe Virtue of Gifting\nBut establishing the virtue of a man giving a gift to his wife does not depend on there being examples of that in the life of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Rather in that regard it is sufficient to note the command to treat one’s wife kindly.\nIslam encourages the giving of gifts , as in the Hadith of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Exchange gifts; you will love one another.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari in Al-Adab Al-Mufrad, 594; classed as authentic by Shaykh Al-Albani in Irwa’ Al-Ghalil, 6/44)\nAnd the wife is one of the people who are most deserving of gifts from her husband.\nKind Treatment of One’s Wife:\nIt was narrated that `A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The best of you are the best of you to his wife, and I am the best of you to my wives.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 3895; he said: This is an authentic Hadith).\nIt was narrated from Hakim ibn Mu`awiyah Al-Qushayri (may Allah have mercy on him) that his father said: I said: O Messenger of Allah, what are the rights of the wife of one of us over him? He said: “That you should feed her when you eat, clothe her when you clothe yourself…” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 2142; classed as authentic by Shaykh Al-Albani in Irwa’ Al-Ghalil, 7/98)\nAllah, may He be Exalted, Says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And live with them in kindness. For if you dislike them – perhaps you dislike a thing and Allah makes therein much good.} [An-Nisa’ 4:19]\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“And live with them in kindness” means: speak kindly to them, and act kindly towards them, and make your appearance good as much as you can. Just as you would like that from her, do that for her too, as Allah, may He be Exalted, Says (interpretation of the meaning): {And due to them [i.e., the wives] is similar to what is expected of them, according to what is reasonable.} [Al-Baqarah 2:228]\xa0\nAnd the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The best of you are the best of you to his wife, and I am the best of you to my wives.” It was the Prophet’s character to always treat his wives kindly, with a cheerful, gentle and playful attitude; he would spend generously on them and joke with his wives.
