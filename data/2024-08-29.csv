472270,"What is the ruling on friends mocking one another by way of joking, meaning that I trade insults with my friend jokingly, when there is no fear of that stirring up enmity?","['Praise be to Allah.Mocking or lampooning means reviling and listing a person’s faults. It is mostly done in poetry, but it may be done in poetry and otherwise. al-Mu‘jam al-Wasit (2/975).\nThere is a clear prohibition on insulting a Muslim. It was narrated from Ibn Mas‘ud (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Trading insults with a Muslim is evildoing and fighting him is disbelief (kufr).” Al-Bukhari (48).\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The Arabic word sabb (reviling) means insulting and saying about the person things that shame him. Reviling someone for no legitimate reason is prohibited, according to the consensus of the ummah, and the one who does that is an evildoer, as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said.""(Sharh an-Nawawi ‘ala Muslim\xa0 2/53).\nIf it so happens that the insult is said by way of joking, that is not allowed either, because such insults are usually wrong and foul-mouthed. In the hadith it is narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: They said: O Messenger of Allah, you joke with us. He said: “I never say anything but that which is true.” At-Tirmidhi (1990); he said: This is as hasan sahih hadith. It was also classed as sahih by al-Albani in as-Silsilah as-Sahihah (1726).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: It is customary for friends to joke, and those jokes include saying rude words. Is this regarded as prohibited?\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) replied: Yes, rude words which include false accusations, cursing and the like, are prohibited, even if they are said by way of joking, because the Muslim has sanctity and it is not permissible to violate that sanctity.""(Fatawa Nur ‘ala ad-Darb by al-‘Uthaymin\xa0 24/2).\nIt makes no difference whether the insult comes in the form of poetry or prose; rather poetry has more impact, because it is easy to memorize and circulate.\nSecondly:\nYour saying that you mock one another jokingly when there is no fear of that stirring up enmity is not correct, because it is well established for people of reason that people are affected by what is said about them, even if they pretend otherwise because it is said as a joke. Rather it is said that what a person cannot say in earnest he will say as a joke. Educationalists and behaviourists have stated that the impact of such words remains in the psyche. Hence Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {And tell My servants to say that which is best} [al-Isra’ 17:53]. This indicates that speaking unkind words is a means by which the Shaytan sows discord among people, whether the words are said in earnest or in jest. Real-life experience tells us how often jokes create grudges, enmity and rancour, so how about if the jokes include insults and mockery?\nHence it is not appropriate for you to mock one another, even if that is by way of joking; rather you should let your joking be by saying good and permissible words. According to the hadith, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The Muslim is the one from whose words and actions the Muslims are safe.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (10).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/472270/what-is-the-ruling-on-insulting-and-mocking-by-way-of-joking
109538,If I travel to another place during Ramadan and my Salat I missed is Qasr; when I come back should I pray full Salat or half.,"['Praise be to Allah.Making up missed prayers when not travelling\nIf a person misses prayers when he is travelling and makes them up when he is at home, he should make them up in shortened form as if he prayed them whilst travelling, according to the more correct opinion, because making up should match the original that was missed . This is the view of the Hanafis and Malikis, and of the Shafa`is in the older madhhab.\xa0(End quote from Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah, 27/281)\xa0\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti` (4/367): “A man reached his city then he remembered that he had not prayed Dhuhr whilst travelling. So he has to pray it with four Rak`ahs, because it is a prayer that became obligatory for him whilst he was not travelling, so he has to offer it in full. And because shortening the prayer is a concession of travel; once he is no longer travelling then he has to offer it in full.\xa0\nThis is our Madhhab (i.e., the Hanbali school of jurisprudence); but the more correct view is different, i.e., if he remembers a prayer that should have been offered whilst travelling when he gets home, he should offer it in the shortened form because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If a person sleeps and misses a prayer or forgets it, let him offer it when he remembers it,” i.e., let him offer it as it should have been offered. This man remembered that he had not prayed Dhuhr when it was two Rak`ahs in his case, so he does not have to offer it in full.”\nFour scenarios of remembering missed prayers\nAnd he said (4/383):\xa0\n“Based on this, there are four possible scenarios with regard to this issue:\xa0\n\nHe remembered a prayer that should have been offered whilst travelling when he was still travelling; so he should offer it in shortened form .\nHe remembered a prayer that should have been offered whilst he was not travelling when he was not travelling; so he should offer it in complete form.\nHe remembered a prayer that should have been offered whilst he was travelling when he was not travelling; he should offer it in shortened form according to the correct opinion.\nHe remembered a prayer that should have been offered whilst he was not travelling when he was travelling; he should offer it in complete form.”\n\nConsequences of delaying or missing prayers\nIt should be noted that prayer is of great importance and that it is not permissible to delay it until after the time it is due except when joining prayers. If a person sleeps or forgets a prayer, then he should pray it when he wakes up or remembers it, and he is not allowed to delay it. Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And when you have completed the prayer, remember Allah standing, sitting, or [lying] on your sides. But when you become secure, re-establish [regular] prayer. Indeed, prayer has been decreed upon the believers a decree of specified times.} [An-Nisa’ 4:103]\n{Maintain with care the [obligatory] prayers and [in particular] the middle [i.e., `Asr] prayer and stand before Allah, devoutly obedient.} [Al-Baqarah 2:238]\n{But there came after them successors [i.e., later generations] who neglected prayer and pursued desires; so they are going to meet evil.} [Maryam 19:59]\nIbn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said concerning the word Ghayy (translated above as “evil”): It is a valley in Hell that is very deep and foul.\xa0\nAnd Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{So woe to those who pray, [But] who are heedless of their prayer [i.e., the hypocrites who are unconcerned if they miss prayers when no one sees them].} [Al-Ma`un 107:4-5]\nAnd when the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was asked: Which deed is dearest to Allah?, he replied: “Prayer offered on time.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 527 and Muslim, 85)\xa0\nAnd he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever gives up `Asr prayer, his (good) deeds are rendered invalid.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 553)\xa0\nAnd he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not associate anything with Allah, even if you are cut and burned. Do not neglect any prescribed prayer deliberately, for whoever neglects it deliberately no longer has the protection of Allah. And do not drink wine, for it is the key to all evil.” (Narrated by Ibn Majah, 4034 and classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah)\xa0\nWe ask Allah to guide us and you and to keep us all steadfast.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/109538/can-you-pray-qasr-after-returning-home
510568,"How should I give zakah on shares which I bought three years ago for the purpose of selling them, but I was not able to sell them, because I would not make any profit. I am waiting until they reach the purchase price or more, then I will sell them, in sha Allah.","['Praise be to Allah.If someone buys shares with the intention of selling them, then they are trade goods and are subject to zakah every year. So he should work out their value when one (Hijri) year has passed, then give one quarter of one tenth (2.5%) as zakah, whether the value has dropped below the purchase price or has risen.\nIf he does not have cash to give, he should work out the zakah that is due, then wait until he sells the shares, after which he must give what he owns.\nThe Permanent Committee was asked about real estate shares, which have remained for a long time with no increase in their value, and which may have fallen below the basic market value.\nThey replied: The shares mentioned in the question come under the heading of trade goods, so they are subject to zakah. Their value must be worked out every year, regardless of the purchase price. Then if the owner has money he should pay zakah from it, otherwise he should give zakah for past years after he sells them and receives payment for them.""(Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah\xa0 9/353).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Should zakah on shares be based on the official value of the share or on its market value, or what?\nHe replied: Zakah on shares and other trade goods should be based on the market value. So if at the time of purchase the value was one thousand, then it it has risen to two thousand at the time when zakah becomes due, the value should be regarded as being two thousand, because what matters is the value at the time when zakah becomes due, not the value at the time of purchase.""(Majmu‘ Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymin\xa018/197).\nFor more information, please see the answers to questions no. 231858 and 130487 .\nThe time for paying zakah on shares is the time for paying zakah on the cash with which you bought the shares, if the cash reached the minimum threshold (nisab). So if someone acquired cash which reached the minimum threshold, which is equivalent to 595 grams of silver, in Ramadan, then he bought shares with it in Dhu’l-Hijjah, the zakah year begins in Ramadan.\xa0\nIn Zad al-Mustaqni‘ p. 87, it says: If he bought trade goods with cash or other goods that reached the minimum threshold, then the zakah year for what he bought is the same as the zakah year for the wealth with which he purchased those goods.\nSo the minimum threshold for cash is: 595 x 3.66 = 21,777 riyals.\nIf the cash did not reach the minimum threshold, then the zakah year begins from when the value of the shares reached the minimum threshold.\nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 99400 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/510568/if-someone-buys-shares-with-the-intention-of-selling-them-then-their-value-drops-below-the-purchase-price-how-should-he-give-zakah-on-them
104805,"What are a daughter’s rights over her mother’s husband, and what are her duties? What are the man’s rights and duties regarding his stepdaughter?","['Praise be to Allah.Is a Stepfather Mahram?\nThe stepdaughter is the daughter of a wife from someone other than her current husband; she is permanently forbidden in marriage to the man if he has consummated his marriage with her mother. This means that she has become one of his Mahrams .\nIt says in Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah (17/367):\n“If a man marries a woman and consummates the marriage with her, it becomes permanently forbidden for him to marry one of her daughters or one of the daughters of her sons, no matter how far the line of descent extents, whether she is a daughter from a previous or subsequent husband, because Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted) says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Prohibited to you [for marriage] are your mothers… and your stepdaughters under your guardianship [born] of your wives unto whom you have gone in.} [An-Nisa’ 4:23]\nThe stepdaughter here is the wife’s daughter . A man is regarded as a Mahram of the daughters of a woman whom he marries and with whom he consummates the marriage; it becomes permissible for them not to observe HHijab in front of him. ” (End quote)\nRights and Duties of a Stepdaughter and Her Stepfather\nWith regard to the rights and duties of a stepdaughter and her mother’s husband towards one another, they may be summed up as upholding ties, respecting one another , and treating one another kindly. All Muslims are enjoined to treat their fellow Muslims with kindness, so how about those who become Mahrams due to ties through marriage. Undoubtedly they have a greater right to kindness and care than Muslims in general.\nBut spending on maintenance, serving and obeying are not obligatory between them. The stepdaughter does not come under the same ruling as her mother in these matters in terms of it being obligatory according to Islamic teachings. If the husband spends on his stepdaughter out of kindness, and she responds by treating him well, taking care of his house and serving him, then that is good, because bringing people together and creating harmony between them is an aim that Islam seeks to achieve.\nThe husband should understand that kind treatment of his wife includes kind treatment of her daughter. And the daughter should understand that part of honouring her mother is honouring the mother’s husband and treating him kindly.\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: (25/365):\n“There is the hope for the one who takes care of women other than his daughters, such as his sisters, paternal aunts, maternal aunts, and others who are in need, treating them with kindness, and providing them with food, drink and clothing, will attain a reward like that mentioned by the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) with regard to the one who takes care of three daughters, for the\xa0 grace and mercy of Allah are immense.\xa0\nThe same applies to one who takes care of one or two daughters or others, and treats them kindly; there is the hope that he will attain a great reward, as is indicated by the general meaning of the verses and hadiths that speak of kindness towards the poor and needy, relatives and others.\xa0\nIf this is the virtue of showing kindness towards daughters, then showing kindness towards parents, or one of them, or grandfathers or grandmothers ,will bring an even greater reward, because of the great significance of parents’ rights, and the obligation to honour them and treat them kindly. It makes no difference whether the one who is showing kindness is a father or a mother or anyone else, because the reward is connected to the deed. And Allah is the source of strength.” (End quote)\nThe importance of upholding kinship ties in Islam\nThe Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas was asked (25/296): How should the social family ties be in the Muslim household?\nThey replied:\n“Allah has enjoined upholding that which will strengthen ties between family members. He enjoins upholding ties of kinship, and treating relatives kindly, as He, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And fear Allah, through whom you ask one another, and the wombs. Indeed Allah is ever, over you, an Observer} [An-Nisa’ 4:1]\n{Worship Allah and associate nothing with Him, and to parents do good, and to relatives…} [An-Nisa’ 4:36]\n{Say, Come, I will recite what your Lord has prohibited to you. [He commands] that you not associate anything with Him, and to parents, good treatment, and do not kill your children out of poverty; We will provide for you and them} [Al-An`am 6:151]\n{And your Lord has decreed that you not worship except Him, and to parents, good treatment.} [Al-Isra’ 17:23]\nAnd there are other similar verses in the Quran.\nIt is proven that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “No one who severs ties of kinship will enter Paradise.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim)\nAnd he said: “Whoever would like for his provision to be increased and his life to be extended, let him uphold ties of kinship.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi)\nAnd he said: “Allah has forbidden to you disobedience towards mothers and burying daughters alive…” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim)\nAnd there are many other hadiths which encourage upholding of ties of kinship , adhering to Islamic etiquette and noble characteristics , and maintaining kind treatment, all of which strengthen the bonds between families and family members, and bring all Muslims together. This is the right way, not drifting away from the path of Islam and ignoring Islamic etiquette and the call for good manners.
