240066,"Is it permissible to take a loan from one of the banks in Saudi which has a scholarly committee that allows a specific increase, and to take the money to make a down payment for purchasing a piece of land in my city in Egypt by instalments, then take possession of it after a year for the purpose of building on it or selling it?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt is not permissible for the lender to stipulate in a loan contract that the borrower must pay back the loan with more than he took. The scholars are unanimously agreed that any loan which brings a benefit to the lender is riba.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Mughni (4/240):\nAny loan in which it is stipulated that more should be paid back is haram, and there is no difference of scholarly opinion on that. Ibn al-Mundhir said: They (the scholars) are unanimously agreed that if the lender stipulates that the borrower must pay back more or give him a gift, and he gives the loan on that basis, then accepting the extra amount on that basis is riba.\nIt was narrated from Ubayy ibn Ka‘b, Ibn ‘Abbas and Ibn Mas‘ud that they forbade loans that bring benefits. End quote.\nSecondly:\nIt is permissible to make the borrower pay the costs of issuing the loan and other related services, on condition that the amount paid is equal to the real costs involved in issuing the loan. If the amount paid is greater than the real costs of issuing the loan, then that additional amount is riba.\nIt says in a statement of the Islamic Fiqh Council (no. 13 (1/3)):\nFirstly: it is permissible to charge a fee for issuing loans, provided that it is within the limits of the actual costs. Secondly: anything more than the actual cost of this service is haram, because it comes under the heading of riba, which is prohibited according to Islamic teachings. End quote.\nWhat confirms that administrative fees are not greater than the actual costs of administration is when the fees are not increased when the amount of the loan is increased, or when payment is delayed.\nShaykh Yusuf ash-Shubayli (may Allah preserve him) said:\nIf the stipulated increase to be paid to the bank is connected to the length of time taken to pay back the loan, or is connected to the value of the loan, then it is haram, whether it is to be paid to the bank in instalments (0.5% to be paid annually, for example) or it is to be paid in one go when taking out the loan or when paying it back, and regardless of whether it is called interest or services or fees, or any other name. When drawing up the contract, what matters is what the clauses really mean, not how they are phrased.\nBut if the extra amount that is stipulated is a set amount and is not impacted by the value of the loan or how long it takes to pay it back – such as if the bank charges a set fee to issue a loan, such as one hundred and fifty dinars for example – then what appears to be the case is that this transaction is permissible, whether payment of these fees is separate from paying off the loan, or it is added to the total value of the loan. That is because in reality, these fees are not additional to the loan; rather they are fees that the bank is entitled to charge in return for the work done in order to issue the loan, such as phone calls, messages, employee salaries, and so on, which is work for which the bank has the right to charge fees, according to Islamic teachings.

262300,"How can I wash off impurity (najasah) in a correct manner? I hope you can explain the following scenarios: 1. Cleansing impurity from a smooth, impermeable surface, as opposed to a permeable surface (I have heard that you do not need to use water on a smooth, impermeable surface). Also, how many times does it have to be washed with water? 2. How can we make cushions and pillows, and all thick items, pure? 3. How many times must urine/non-visible impurities be washed from clothing? Also, do we have to wring them out or is it sufficient to wash them under running water, using the same amount of water as we would use to wash them and wring them out? 4. I have heard that we can submerge the clothing in a vessel filled with water that is three times the amount of urine (so let’s say that the urine is 100 ml; we can submerge that part of the garment in 300 ml of water without needing to wring it out). Or if we put the clothes in the bathtub, the impurity will not affect the water. Is that correct? If it is correct, what about non-visible impurity that we cannot see? 5. Are washing machines good to get rid of impurity, if the cycle is not 3 times? The clothes come out with no trace of impurity. 6. The following question is somewhat related: can I use detergents if I do not know whether any ingredients in them of animal origin are haram or not? Will this make all the clothes impure (especially if the detergents use ingredients of animal origin)? Or are all detergents halal because they do not have the physical characteristics of the animal? I’m sorry for asking so many questions, but I have looked everywhere and have not been able to find answers. May Allah reward you with good.","['Praise be to Allah.I.\xa0\nItems that are solid and smooth (impermeable) may be purified by wiping them, according to the correct view, which is the view of Malik and Abu Hanifah, because what matters is removing the impure substance.\nAl-Kasani (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Bada’i‘ as-Sana’i‘ (1/85):\nIf an impure substance (najasah) gets onto something that is solid and smooth (impermeable), such as a sword, mirror and the like, it may be cleansed by scratching, whether it is wet or dry, because none of the impurity will seep through it, and its surface may be cleansed by wiping and scratching. End quote.\nAd-Dasuqi al-Maliki said in al-Hashiyah ‘ala ash-Sharh al-Kabir (1/77): Conclusion: in the case of anything that is solid and smooth (impermeable), when there is the fear that it may be damaged by washing, such as a sword and the like, what got onto it of permissible blood, even if there is a large amount, may be overlooked, for fear of damaging it by washing it. End quote.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Majmu‘ (2/599): If the impure substance (najasah) gets onto something solid, like a sword, knife, mirror and the like, it cannot be cleansed by wiping and can only be cleansed by washing like other things. This was the view of Ahmad and Dawud. Malik and Abu Hanifah said: It may be cleansed by wiping. End quote.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said:\nIn the case of things from which the impure substance may be removed by rubbing – which is items that are smooth, such as mirrors and swords, which do not absorb impurity – the correct view is that they may be purified by rubbing.\nSo if the mirror becomes contaminated with an impure substance, then it is rubbed until it becomes clear, with no impurity on it, then it has been purified.""(Ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘\xa0 1/426).\nII.\nIf the impure substance gets onto cushions and large furnishings such as rugs and the like, then the way to purify them is by pouring water on the impure spot, until the water overwhelms the impure substance that got onto it. Then the water that is contaminated with the impure substance should be dried up with a sponge or some other tool or machine. If the impure substance is removed by that means and no trace of it remains, then this is the desired outcome. If it does not disappear, then it must be washed a second or third time, until you think it most likely that it has been removed. There is no stipulation that the water used should be two or three times the amount of the impure substance, and the like.\nIt is not essential to wring out the impurity or to rub it, so long as the impure substance has disappeared.\nPlease see the answer to question no. 213577 .\nIII.\nThere is no religious text which states the number of times impurity must be washed, except the impurity of a dog only, which must be washed seven times, one of which should be with dust. As for other kinds of impurity, no specific number is specified; rather it must be washed until the impure substance disappears, even if that is achieved by washing it only once.\nSee the answer to question no. 163825 .\nIV.\nWhat matters with regard to water by means of which an impure substance is removed is that it should be a copious amount, so that it will remove the impure substance and leave no trace of its colour or smell, without specifying a particular amount.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Mughni (1/75), regarding purifying impurity other than that of a dog or pig, and whether washing it a specific number of times is required: There are two reports – meaning from Imam Ahmad – regarding that. The first report says that there is a stipulated number of times for that, by analogy with the impurity of a dog… The second report says that there is no stipulated number of times; rather it is sufficient to pour a great deal of water [on the impure substance], without counting a specific number of times, until the impurity is removed. This is the view of ash-Shafa‘i. End quote.\nAfter researching the matter, we have not come across any statement by any scholar to suggest that it is sufficient for the water to be three times the amount of the impure substance. What appears to be the case is that that would not be sufficient, and that this amount of water would be contaminated by the impure substance and would change as a result.\nWhat we found is that some of the scholars stipulated that in order to purify the ground of impurity, the water must be seven times the amount of the impure substance.\nThis view is more likely to be correct than the previous view, yet it is a weak view too, and we do not know of any evidence to indicate that it is sound.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: What is required in order to remove impurity that has seeped into the ground is to pour a large amount of water, so that the impure substance will be absorbed into it.\nAnd there is a view which stipulates that the water that is poured on the ground should be seven times the amount of the urine.\nThis is a weak view; the correct view is the first one.""(Al-Majmu‘\xa0 2/611).\nBased on that, what matters is that the water should be of a large amount, so as to remove the impurity, without specifying a particular amount of water.\nV.\nThe more correct scholarly view is that if impurity falls into water, it does not become impure unless it is changed thereby, such as if its colour or smell is changed.\nThis is the view of the Malikis, and is mentioned in one report from Imam Ahmad. It was regarded as more correct by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah and his student Ibn al-Qayyim. It is also the view favoured by many contemporary scholars, such as Shaykh Ibn Baz, Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin, and the scholars of the Permanent Committee for Ifta’ (may Allah have mercy on them).\nPlease see the answer to question no. 224923 .\nBased on that, if the impure garment is put in the bathtub and does not change the water that is in it, then the water remains pure and does not become impure thereby. But if the colour or smell of the water is changed by the impurity, then it becomes impure.\nBut whatever the case, you should not place the impure garment into a tub of water, if possible; rather you should wash off the impurity first, or pour water over it, so as to ward off any intrusive thoughts and so as to take into consideration the scholarly view which says that the water becomes impure thereby.\nVI.\nIf the impure garment is washed in a washing machine and the trace of impurity is removed from it, then it becomes pure thereby.\nPlease see the answer to question no. 163825 .\nVII.\nWith regard to your question about detergents and what they may contain of ingredients derived from impure animal sources, this is subject to further discussion:\nIf these detergents are obtained from animals which are impure, but after being processed and treated they turn into different substances with characteristics different from those of the impure source from which they were extracted, then there is nothing wrong with using them and cleaning things with them.\nBut if they have not undergone a complete transformation – rather they have retained some of the characteristics of the impure source from which they were obtained – then it is not permissible to use them, because they are part of something impure.\nSo long as we are not certain whether these impurities are present or not, the basic principle regarding these products is that they are pure and halal, and we should not open the door to intrusive thoughts, doubts and hardship.\nIn most cases, that which is derived from animals that were not slaughtered in the prescribed manner and animals that are not permissible to eat will have been transformed from its original state and will have been purified by this transformation. Therefore we may use such things without needing to pay attention to any of that.\nPlease see answer to question no. 97541 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/262300/questions-about-impurity-najasah-and-how-to-cleanse-things-of-it
