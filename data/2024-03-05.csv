230308,"Some brothers put posts on a local Facebook page in their city when the time for prayer begins, saying “Prayer is better than Facebook.” What we have noticed is that some members of the page comment on that, denouncing this phrase and saying that they know nothing except the phrase “Prayer is better than sleep.” Is there anything wrong with using this phrase?","['Praise be to Allah.I put this question to our shaykh, ‘Abd ar-Rahman al-Barrak (may Allah preserve him), and he replied that there is nothing wrong with that, because it comes under the heading of reminding people to do good, and it does not matter that what they say resembles the phrase “Prayer is better than sleep.”\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/230308/reminding-people-of-prayer-by-saying-prayer-is-better-than-facebook
8599,Is it permissible for a Muslim to give Salams to a Muslim when he is praying or he is making Dhikr or Du`a?,"['Praise be to Allah.Can you give Salam to someone who is praying?\nIt is prescribed for a Muslim to initiate the greeting of Salam to his Muslim brother when he is praying , but the one who is praying should not return the Salams whilst praying, except by making a gesture in a manner that will maintain the validity of his prayer.\nIt was narrated that Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I asked Bilal, How did the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) return their Salam when they greeted him whilst he was praying? He said, With a gesture of his hand.” (Narrated by Ahmad, 6/12; Abu Dawud, 1/569, no. 927; At-Tirmidhi, 2/204, no. 368; Al-Bayhaqi, 2/262; also narrated by the five)\n\xa0It was also narrated from him that Suhayb (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I passed by the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) whilst he was praying. I greeted him with Salam\xa0and he responded with a gesture .” And he said: I am not sure whether he said “a gesture with his fingers.” (Narrated by the five, apart from Ibn Majah. At-Tirmidhi said: both hadiths are sahih (authentic) in my view).\n\xa0It was reported that Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: I heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbidding us to pray two Rak`ahs after `Asr, then I saw him praying them when he prayed `Asr. She said, he entered and there were some women from Bani Haram, from among the Ansar, with me. He started to pray them [these two Rak`ahs after `Asr], so I sent a young girl to him, and I told her, `Stand beside him and say to him, Umm Salamah is saying to you, O Messenger of Allah, I heard you forbidding us to do these two Rak`ahs and now I see you praying them. If he makes a gesture with his hand then leave him and go back.’ So the young girl did that and he made a gesture with his hand, so she left him and went back. When he finished praying, he said: `O daughter of Abu Umayyah, you asked about the two Rak`ahs after `Asr. Some people from Banu `Abd Al-Qays came to me and kept me from doing the two Rak`ahs after Dhuhr, and that is what these were.’” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim)\n\xa0These hadiths indicate that it is prescribed to say Salams to a person whilst he is praying, and that he should respond to the greeting with a gesture , because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) approved of initiating the Salam, and he returned the greeting with a gesture only.\nCan you give Salam to someone who is making Dhikr and Du`a?\nIt is prescribed for the Muslim to initiate the greeting to one who is engaged in making Dhikr or Du`a. It was reported that Abu Waqid Al-Laythi (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “Whilst the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was sitting in the mosque and there were some people with him, three people came in. Two of them came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and one went away. When they came up to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), they greeted him with Salam. One of them found a space in the circle and sat down, and the other sat down behind him. The third one turned and went away. When the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had finished (his talk), he said: `Shall I tell you about these three people? One of them turned to Allah so Allah accepted him; the second felt shy so Allah will feel shy (to punish him); and the third turned away so Allah turned away from him.” (Narrated by Malik in Al-Muwatta’, 2/960; Ahmad, 5/219; Al-Bukhari, 1/24, 122; Muslim, 4/1713, no. 2176; At-Tirmidhi, 5/73, no. 2724; Abu Ya`la, 3/33, no. 1445)\nAnd in As-Sahihayn it is narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that a Bedouin entered the mosque and prayed, but he did not do the Ruku` and Sujud properly. Then he came and greeted the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) with Salam . The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) returned his greeting then said, “Go back and pray, for you have not prayed.”\nAnd Allah is the Source of strength. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad and his family and Companions, and grant them peace.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/8599/can-you-give-salam-to-someone-who-is-praying

But if the impurity does not change it, then it remains pure.

But if you are certain that it is impure and you are uncertain as to whether it is pure, then do not do wudu’ with it, because the basic principle is that it remains impure.

210653,"What is the ruling on using cosmetic materials for men, such as putting cream on the skin to beautify it (to whiten the skin)? Is that permissible? Because using cosmetics for men is something that is very widespread in the subcontinent.","['Praise be to Allah.The ruling on men using cosmetics such as creams and so on varies from one case to another. To explain further:\xa0\n\nIn the case of things that are used only for the purpose of beautification or adornment, it is not appropriate for men to use them, because the woman is the one who needs beautification. What is appropriate for the man is the marks of masculinity such as roughness and toughness; being feminine or effeminate is not appropriate for him.\xa0\nWhatever is specifically for the adornment or beautification of women only, such as lipstick, nail polish, and so on, it is not permissible for men to adorn themselves with it, because that comes under the heading of imitating women, and imitating them is forbidden and is a major sin.\n\n\nIf the use of something will lead to a change in the colour of the skin , from dark to light for example, if that change is temporary then there is nothing wrong with it, but if the change is permanent, then it is not permissible, because that comes under the heading of changing the creation of Allah , may He be Exalted.\xa0\n\nIt should also be noted that using these types of cosmetics is not appropriate for men, as stated above.\xa0\n\nThere is nothing wrong with using things that are for the purpose of removing defects , such as using creams to remove spots from the face, because this comes under the heading of medical treatment.\xa0\n\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\xa0\nWhat is the ruling on using creams and preparations to whiten the skin or to remove acne or other blemishes?\xa0\nHe replied:\xa0\n“With regard to the former, then no; that is, you should not use anything to change the colour of the skin , because this is worse than tattooing for which the one who does it is cursed.\xa0\nWith regard to removing acne and the like, there is nothing wrong with that, because this is treating disease , and there is nothing wrong with treating disease. There is a difference between that which is intended for the purpose of beautification and that which is intended for the purpose of removing a defect. The former is not permissible if it is done permanently, whereas the latter is permissible."" (Fatawa Nur `Ala Ad-Darb, 22/2)\nIt should also be pointed out that whatever of such preparations is made from impure substances or harmful chemical substances, it is not permissible to use it in any case whatsoever.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/210653/are-cosmetics-prohibited-for-men
