8599,Is it permissible for a Muslim to give Salams to a Muslim when he is praying or he is making Dhikr or Du`a?,"['Praise be to Allah.Can you give Salam to someone who is praying?\nIt is prescribed for a Muslim to initiate the greeting of Salam to his Muslim brother when he is praying , but the one who is praying should not return the Salams whilst praying, except by making a gesture in a manner that will maintain the validity of his prayer.\nIt was narrated that Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I asked Bilal, How did the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) return their Salam when they greeted him whilst he was praying? He said, With a gesture of his hand.” (Narrated by Ahmad, 6/12; Abu Dawud, 1/569, no. 927; At-Tirmidhi, 2/204, no. 368; Al-Bayhaqi, 2/262; also narrated by the five)\n\xa0It was also narrated from him that Suhayb (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I passed by the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) whilst he was praying. I greeted him with Salam\xa0and he responded with a gesture .” And he said: I am not sure whether he said “a gesture with his fingers.” (Narrated by the five, apart from Ibn Majah. At-Tirmidhi said: both hadiths are sahih (authentic) in my view).\n\xa0It was reported that Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: I heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbidding us to pray two Rak`ahs after `Asr, then I saw him praying them when he prayed `Asr. She said, he entered and there were some women from Bani Haram, from among the Ansar, with me. He started to pray them [these two Rak`ahs after `Asr], so I sent a young girl to him, and I told her, `Stand beside him and say to him, Umm Salamah is saying to you, O Messenger of Allah, I heard you forbidding us to do these two Rak`ahs and now I see you praying them. If he makes a gesture with his hand then leave him and go back.’ So the young girl did that and he made a gesture with his hand, so she left him and went back. When he finished praying, he said: `O daughter of Abu Umayyah, you asked about the two Rak`ahs after `Asr. Some people from Banu `Abd Al-Qays came to me and kept me from doing the two Rak`ahs after Dhuhr, and that is what these were.’” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim)\n\xa0These hadiths indicate that it is prescribed to say Salams to a person whilst he is praying, and that he should respond to the greeting with a gesture , because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) approved of initiating the Salam, and he returned the greeting with a gesture only.\nCan you give Salam to someone who is making Dhikr and Du`a?\nIt is prescribed for the Muslim to initiate the greeting to one who is engaged in making Dhikr or Du`a. It was reported that Abu Waqid Al-Laythi (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “Whilst the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was sitting in the mosque and there were some people with him, three people came in. Two of them came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and one went away. When they came up to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), they greeted him with Salam. One of them found a space in the circle and sat down, and the other sat down behind him. The third one turned and went away. When the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had finished (his talk), he said: `Shall I tell you about these three people? One of them turned to Allah so Allah accepted him; the second felt shy so Allah will feel shy (to punish him); and the third turned away so Allah turned away from him.” (Narrated by Malik in Al-Muwatta’, 2/960; Ahmad, 5/219; Al-Bukhari, 1/24, 122; Muslim, 4/1713, no. 2176; At-Tirmidhi, 5/73, no. 2724; Abu Ya`la, 3/33, no. 1445)\nAnd in As-Sahihayn it is narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that a Bedouin entered the mosque and prayed, but he did not do the Ruku` and Sujud properly. Then he came and greeted the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) with Salam . The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) returned his greeting then said, “Go back and pray, for you have not prayed.”\nAnd Allah is the Source of strength.

I do not want from them any provision, nor do I want them to feed Me. Indeed, it is Allah who is the [continual] Provider, the firm Possessor of strength (Adh-Dhariyat 51:56-58).\n""Thus, He, Glorified be He, informed that He created the creation for His worship, and sent all the messengers commanding to worship Him Alone.""\nSee: ""Jawab Al-I`tiradat Al-Misriyyah `Ala Al-Fatwa Al-Hamawiyyah"" (p. 90).\nImam Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him)\xa0said: ""Without the divine command, the creation of man would have been in vain and futile, and Allah is exalted above that, and He has absolved Himself from it, just as He has absolved Himself from defects and deficiencies. Allah the Exalted says (translation of the meaning): Then did you think that We created you uselessly and that to Us you would not be returned?\xa0and He says (translation of the meaning): Does man think that he will be left neglected?\xa0Ash-Shafi`i said (concerning the ayah): \'That he is not commanded nor prohibited.\'""\nIt is known that leaving man like\xa0animals, neglected and idle, is contrary to wisdom; for he was created for the purpose of his perfection, and his perfection is to be knowledgeable of his Lord, loving Him, and standing in His servitude. Allah the Exalted says (translation of the meaning): And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me, and He says (translation of the meaning): That you may know that Allah is over all things competent and that Allah has encompassed all things in knowledge, and He says (translation of the meaning): That is so you may know that Allah knows whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth, and that Allah is Knowing of all things.\nThis knowledge and this servitude are the purpose of creation and the command, and they are the greatest perfection of man, and Allah the Exalted, out of His care and Mercy for him, has exposed him to this perfection and prepared for him its apparent and hidden causes, and enabled him to attain it.\nThe basis of the divine command is Islam, faith, and excellence, and they all go back to being grateful for all blessings, small and great, from Him, and to glorify and revere Him and to deal with Him in a manner befitting His Majesty. So His favors are mentioned, and He is thanked and not denied, and He is obeyed and not disobeyed, and He is remembered and not forgotten.\nThis, along with the divine command including the adornment of the servant with every beautiful character, and his performance of every good deed and correct speech, and his avoidance of every bad character, and abstaining from every ugly act and false statement. Thus, his command includes the noblest of morals, the beauties of actions, the truth of speech, and benevolence to creation, and perfecting himself with all kinds of perfections, and shunning their opposites, and purifying himself from them, while exposing him to the great and everlasting reward, and the companionship of his Lord in the abode of eternity.\nSo which of the two matters is more befitting of wisdom? This, or sending him neglected like horses, mules, and donkeys, eating, drinking, and mating like animals?!\nAnd does His sacred perfection require that?!\n{So high [above all] is Allah, the Sovereign, the Truth.

Indeed, he was unjust and ignorant. [It was] so that Allah may punish the hypocrite men and hypocrite women and the polytheist men and polytheist women and that Allah may accept repentance from the believing men and believing women. And ever is Allah Forgiving and Merciful (Al-Ahzab 33:72-73).\nThe Trust mentioned in the noble verse is the performance of obligations and acting in obedience to Allah, as reported from Ibn `Abbas who said: ""The Trust: the obligations, Allah offered them to the heavens and the earth and the mountains, if they performed them, He would reward them, and if they neglected them, He would punish them. They disliked that and feared it without disobedience, but out of reverence for the religion of Allah lest they fail to uphold it, then He offered it to Adam who accepted it with all that it entailed.""\nImam Ibn Kathir mentioned several opinions regarding the Trust, including:\n1- That it is: obedience.\n2- That it is: the religion, obligations, and limits.\n3- That it is: the bath from sexual impurity.\n4- That it is: the Trust is threefold: prayer, fasting, and the bath from sexual impurity.\nThen he said: ""And all these opinions do not contradict each other, rather they are consistent and return to the fact that it is the divine command, and acceptance of the commands and prohibitions with their condition, which is that if one fulfills them, he is rewarded, and if he neglects them, he is punished. So man accepted it despite his weakness, ignorance, and injustice, except for those whom Allah has guided, and with Allah is aid sought"" End quote from ""Tafsir Ibn Kathir"" (6/488-489).\nThirdly:\nThere is no contradiction between the noble verses mentioned in the question, for in the verse of offering the Trust, it is stated that man accepted the Trust with all that it entails of honor and obligation, and this is a choice from him to bear these obligations, and in the first verse, Allah the Exalted clarified the purpose of creating all creation, which is: His worship, and this worship is achieved by man by choice, not compulsion. Allah the Exalted created them for worship, so among them are those who believe and those who disbelieve. So whoever believes has fulfilled the Trust he chose before, and whoever disbelieves has betrayed that Trust.\nAs Allah the Exalted says (translation of the meaning): And [mention] when your Lord took from the children of Adam - from their loins - their descendants and made them testify of themselves, [saying to them], \'Am I not your Lord?\' They said, \'Yes, we have testified.\' [This] - lest you should say on the day of Resurrection, \'Indeed, we were of this unaware.\' Or [lest] you say, \'It was only that our fathers associated [others with Allah] before, and we were but descendants after them. Then would You destroy us for what the falsifiers have done?\' And thus do We [explain in] detail the verses, and perhaps they will return (Al-A\'raf 7:172-174).\n""And Allah the Mighty and Majestic says (translation of the meaning): Does man think that he will be left neglected? Indeed, every privilege is met with responsibility and obligation, and the greater the blessings of the Creator, Glorified and Exalted be He, upon the creature, the obligations come with matters of servitude. Allah the Exalted says (translation of the meaning): Indeed, we offered the Trust to the heavens and the earth and the mountains, and they declined to bear it and feared it; but man [undertook to] bear it. Indeed, he was unjust and ignorant.\nThe Trust, as explained by many commentators, is the obligations of servitude to Allah the Exalted. Therefore, the dominion over the universe and the honor with capacities and abilities were met with the burden of the obligations of servitude and stewardship on earth, And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me. The more man realizes the attribute of servitude in himself to Allah the Exalted, the closer he is to fulfilling the requirements of the Trust and keeping the covenant and performing the role entrusted to him. The further he is from the attributes of servitude to Allah the Exalted, the more his negligence and reluctance in performing his role for which he was created,"" End quote\xa0from ""Mabahith fi I`jaz Al-Quran,"" Dr. Mustafa Muslim (p. 13).\nAnd Allah the Exalted knows what the servants will do, and He has written that, Glorified and Praised be He, and it is necessary to know that Allah the Exalted created all creation for His worship, but the difference between man and others is that Allah the Exalted has given man a choice and will, if he turns to faith, He will guide him, and if he turns away, he will bear the consequences of this aversion.\nRegarding this, some scholars have said about the first verse, that its meaning is: ""Except to submit and acknowledge servitude to Me, and this has occurred from all of them willingly and unwillingly,"" End quote.\nAnd some of them said: ""The verse is specific to those who obey Him from both groups who have performed worship, so the meaning is that whoever is found to have performed worship, then he is created for it, and whoever is not found to have performed it, then he is not created for it.""\nThere are other opinions, and they are incorrect ""and the mistake arises from interpreting the verb (to worship) as occurring, then from those who interpret worship: as the legislative worship, the worship of obedience and compliance, they made the verse specific to the believers; because they are the ones from whom the worship of obedience occurred, not others, or they made it general and considered the tawhid of the disbelievers during hardship as the worship that occurred from them, or considered their acknowledgment of Lordship as the worship that occurred from them, but it does not benefit them. And those who interpret worship as the general worship, the worship of compulsion and submission, made the verse general; because this general servitude occurs from the general public, and likewise, those who interpret worship as recognition.\nAnd the correct view: is what we have presented that the intended worship is the legislative worship, the worship of obedience and compliance, and that the verb (to worship) is expressed as His will, not as its occurrence, and that what is described as being willed without occurrence is only meant as the will to be obligated to it, and the command for it only. So the intended meaning of His saying: And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me: is not the occurrence of worship; rather the command for it as a test.

Does he have to make up this day after fasting six days of Shawwal, so then the number of days that he fasted will be seven, or should he just fast six days of Shawwal?","['Praise be to Allah.The scholars differed concerning one who starts to observe an optional fast : is he obliged to complete it or not? There are two views:\xa0\n\nThat he does not have to complete an optional fast. This is the view of the Shafi`is and Hanbalis, who quoted the following evidence:\xa0\n\n\n`Aishah the Mother of the Believers (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) entered upon me one day and said: ‘Do you have anything (to eat)?’ We said: ‘No.’ He said: ‘Then I am fasting.’ Then he came to us another day and we said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, we have been given some Hays (a kind of meal),’ and he said, ‘Show it to me, for I started the day fasting.’ Then he ate.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1154)\nAbu Juhayfah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “… Abu Ad-Darda’ came and he made some food for him – i.e., for Salman. He said: ‘Eat, for I am fasting.’ Salman said: ‘I will not eat until you eat.’ So he ate… and Salman said to him: ‘Your Lord has rights over you, your soul has rights over you, and your family has rights over you, so give each of them their rights.’ Then he came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and told him about that, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Salman is right.’” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 1968)\nAbu Sa`id Al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I made some food for the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and when it was served a man said: ‘I am fasting.’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Your brother has invited you (to eat) and has gone to some effort for your sake, so break your fast and fast another day in its stead if you wish.’” (Narrated by Ad-Daraqutni, no. 24; classed as sound by Ibn Hajar in Al-Fat-h, 4/210).\n\n\nThe second view is that optional fasts should be completed, and if a person breaks such a fast he has to make it up. This is the view of the Hanafis who quoted the following evidence that such fasts have to be made up:\xa0\n\n\n`Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “Hafsah and I were given a gift of food and we were fasting, so we broke our fast. Then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) entered and we said to him: ‘O Messenger of Allah, we were given this gift and we wanted to eat so we broke our fast.’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘It doesn’t matter; fast another day in its stead.’” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 2457; At-Tirmidhi, 735. Its Isnad (chain of narration) includes Zamil, of whom it says in At-Taqreeb: he is Majhul (unknown). It was classed as inauthentic by An-Nawawi in Al-Majmu`, 6/396 and by Ibn Al-Qayyim in Zad Al-Ma`ad, 2/84. It was also classed as inauthentic by Al-Albani.\nWith regard to the Hadith of `Aishah quoted above from Muslim, some of them add the words: “… ‘I started the day fasting,’ and he ate and said: ‘I will fast another day instead.’”\n\nIt should be noted that An-Nasa’i (may Allah have mercy on him) classed this addition as inauthentic and said: This is wrong. It was also classed as inauthentic by Ad-Daraqutni and Al-Bayhaqi. The first view is the one that is more likely to be correct, because its evidence is stronger. And it is supported by the report narrated from Umm Hani’ (may Allah be pleased with her) who said: “O Messenger of Allah, I broke my fast and I was fasting.” He said to her: “Were you making up for a day you had missed?” She said: “No.” He said: “Then it does not matter if it was a voluntary fast.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 2456; classed as authentic by Al-Albani)\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“If a person is observing an optional fast and something happens and he has to break his fast, then he should break his fast. This is what was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), that he came to the Mother of the Believers `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) and said: “Do you have anything to eat?’ She said: “We have been given some Hays (a kind of meal). He said: “Show it to me, for I started the day fasting.” Then he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) ate some of it. This has to do with optional fasts, not those that are obligatory.” (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 20)\xa0\nBased on this, you do not have to make up the day when you broke your fast, because the one who is observing a voluntary fast is in charge of himself; rather he should complete six days of Shawwal .\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/39827/can-you-break-an-optional-fast

My immediate concern in this regard has resulted from my use of vanilla essence. Propylene Glycol is used I believe as a substitute for ethanol which is why its called essence not extract &is what’s commonly sold in mine & I assume other Muslim countries. The package says it\'s halal but glycol is a primary ingredient that may make up more than even half of the bottle. However even though from what I’ve read saying it’s safe, non-toxic (not sure what that means) & ok in controlled amountsbut I read in a Forbes article that it too is inebriating . It was said that it was a third as much inebriating as regular alcohol so now I’m quite confused. Because wouldn’t this still make it a type of Khamr if it does intoxicate &it is of course a primary ingredient in vanilla essence. Also it’s recommended to double the amount of vanilla essence if a recipe calls for extract since its less powerful. However the overall content of the liquid would be quite insignificant in a general recipe.

(See:\xa0Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah\xa0(43/364-365)\nThe scholars of the Permanent Committee for Ifta’ favour the view that it is obligatory. (See:\xa0Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 4/88)\nHow to wipe the ears during Wudu?\nWith regard to how they are to be wiped, the insides of the ears should be wiped with the forefingers , and the outsides with the thumbs. It is not required to follow the cartilage of the ears when wiping.\nAt-Tirmidhi (36) and An-Nasa’i (102) narrated that Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did Wudu , then he wiped his head and ears, wiping the insides with his forefingers and the outsides with his thumbs. (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in\xa0Sahih An-Nisa’i)\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in\xa0Al-Majmu` (1/443):\n“The Sunnah is to wipe the insides and outsides (of the ears) . The outside is that which is next to the head and the inside is that which is next to the face, as was stated by As-Saymari and others, and this is clear. With regard to how this wiping is to be done, Imam Al-Haramayn, Al-Ghazali and others said: He should put his forefingers into his ear canals and rotate them, running them over the area around the ear canal, and pass his thumbs over the outsides of the ears.”\xa0\nIt says in\xa0Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah\xa0(43/366):\n“The Sunnah when wiping [the ears] is to put the forefingers into the ear canals and wipe the outsides with the thumbs … It is not required to wipe the part of the ears where there is gristle [cartilage].”\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“The way to wipe the ears : the forefingers, meaning the fingers between the middle fingers and thumbs, should be placed in the ear canal, without pushing so much that it causes pain, whilst using the thumbs to wipe the outside of the ears, which is the surface that is next to the head.”\nWe do not know of any authentic Hadith about the manner of wiping the ears which says that it should be done with the pinky and ring finger. What is prescribed is to wipe them in the manner described above, which is proven in the Hadith of Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him). But if the inside and outside of the ear are wiped with whichever fingers one chooses, that is good enough, although the Sunnah, as noted above, is to wipe the outsides with the thumbs and the insides with the forefingers.\nWith regard to the questioner saying that he read a Fatwa about using the pinky finger to wipe the ears, perhaps he meant the forefinger.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/153601/how-to-wipe-the-ears-during-wudu
149470,Is it valid for me to pray Duha in the car because I stay in the car for half an hour before I reach school? Will there be the same reward for it as if I prayed it at school?,"['Praise be to Allah.There are three scenarions here:\n1.. Offering a supererogatory prayer sitting in the car and not facing towards the qiblah, when travelling.\n2.. Offering a supererogatory prayer sitting in a parked car and facing towards the qiblah, when not travelling.\n3.. Offering a supererogatory prayer sitting in a moving car and not facing towards the qiblah, when not travelling.\nRegarding the first and second scenarios, there is scholarly consensus that they are permissible.\nRegarding the third scenario, there is a difference of scholarly opinion concerning it.\nThis may be explained, briefly, as follows:\nWith regard to the first issue:\nIt is proven in the sahih Sunnah that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to offer supererogatory prayers on his mount when travelling, no matter what direction it faced. Thus the condition of facing towards the qiblah is waived, as is the requirement to stand during the prayer, but that is on condition that the prayer is supererogatory (nafil) and it is done when travelling, as noted above.\nBased on that, if someone is travelling in a car, he may pray Duha – and other supererogatory prayers – no matter what direction the car is facing, and he should lean forward for bowing and prostration, making his leaning for prostration deeper than his leaning for bowing.\nIt was narrated from Jabir ibn ‘Abdillah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would offer voluntary prayers whilst riding, not facing in the direction of the qiblah. Narrated by al-Bukhari (1 043) and Muslim (540).\nIt was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to pray whilst travelling on his mount, no matter which direction it was facing, leaning forward [to bow and prostrate], offering the night prayers, except the obligatory prayers, and he prayed Witr on his camel. Narrated by al-Bukhari (955) and Muslim (700).\nThis is a matter concerning which there is scholarly consensus.\nIn al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (27/228 ), it says: The jurists are unanimously agreed that it is permissible for the traveller to offer supererogatory prayers on his mount, no matter what direction it is facing. End quote.\nWith regard to the second issue:\nThere is also no difference of opinion among the scholars regarding the permissibility of offering supererogatory prayers sitting and facing towards the qiblah when not travelling, even when one is able to stand, and that in this case the worshipper will have half the reward of one who prays standing.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWe do not know of any difference of opinion regarding the permissibility of offering voluntary prayers sitting, although it is better to stand. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever prays standing, that is better, and whoever prays sitting, he will have half the reward of the one who prays standing.” Agreed upon. It was narrated by al-Bukhari (1064) only. According to the version narrated by Muslim (735), “A man’s prayer offered sitting is half a prayer.”""(Al-Mughni\xa0 1/811).\nBased on that, if someone prays Duha – or any other regular Sunnah or supererogatory prayer – in a parked car when not travelling, and the car is facing towards the qiblah – or he is able to make himself face towards the qiblah – there is nothing wrong with him praying in that case, according to scholarly consensus, and it makes no difference whether he prays sitting – in that case – in a car or in a house or mosque. He may lean forward for bowing, as he does in his prayer when sitting in the places we have mentioned. The ruling on praying in a parked car is the same as the ruling when praying on the ground, and the condition of facing towards the qiblah is not waived.\nIn that case, the worshipper will have half the reward of the prayer of one who prays standing, as noted above in the sahih hadith.\nWith regard to the third issue:\nIs it permissible to pray sitting in a moving car that is not facing towards the qiblah, when not travelling, as is the case when travelling, or is praying in that way not valid except when travelling? There are two scholarly views:\nThe first view is that it is not permissible, and this is the view of the majority.\nThe second view is that it is permissible. This is the view of Abu Yusuf, Muhammad the companion of Abu Hanifah, and Abu Sa‘id al-Istakhri among the Shafa‘is. It was narrated from Imam Ahmad, and it is the view of at-Tabari, al-Awza‘i, and Ibn Hazm.\nAmong contemporary scholars, it is the view of Shaykh ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Aqil and Shaykh ‘Abdullah ibn Qa‘ud. Shaykh ‘Abdullah ibn Jibrin and Shaykh ‘Abd al-Karim al-Khudayr said that it is permissible when the worshipper fears that the time to offer supererogatory or regular Sunnah prayer is about to end.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWith regard to praying on one’s mount, it is proven in as-Sahih – and, in fact, there are many reports from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) – that he used to pray on his mount when travelling, no matter what direction it was facing in, and he would pray Witr on his mount, but he did not offer any obligatory prayers on it.\nBut is that justified when not travelling? There are two views in the madhhab of Ahmad and others…""(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa\xa024/37, 38).\nSee: Sharh Muslim by an-Nawawi (5/211); al-Majmu‘ by an-Nawawi (3/212); al-Muhalla by Ibn Hazm (3/56); Nayl al-Awtar by ash-Shawkani (2/149).\nSee also the essay by Shaykh ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Aqil (may Allah preserve him) on this specific topic, entitled Tuhfat al-Qafilah fi Hukm as-Salah ‘ala ar-Rahilah.\nAccording to those scholars, it is permissible for the one who is riding in a moving car on the road to offer Duha – and other regular Sunnah and supererogatory prayers – sitting, but it is not preferred for the driver to do that; the worshipper should lean forward for bowing and prostration, and his leaning forward for prostration should be deeper than his leaning forward for bowing.\nWhat is most likely to be correct regarding this matter is the view of the majority, which is that offering supererogatory prayers sitting and not facing towards the qiblah is only (permissible) for one who is riding on a moving mount [or in a moving vehicle], and when travelling, not when not travelling. This is what is proven from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and it is what the contemporary shaykhs ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baz and al-‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on them both), and many others, thought was most likely to be correct.\nSee also the answer to question no. 21869 .\nNote:\nIf someone offers a supererogatory (nafil) prayer sitting when he is able to stand, then he should prostrate properly, on the ground, according to the more correct scholarly view. Standing is waived in his case, and bowing is also waived for him, because it is connected to standing.\nIbn Rushd the grandfather – Muhammad ibn Ahmad – said: His saying that the one who sits should not merely lean forward for prostration unless he has a reason for doing, refers to the obligatory prayer. This is the sound view concerning which there is no difference of opinion, because prostrating is obligatory, like standing, so it is not waived unless the worshipper is unable to do it.\nRather he said that he may lean forward [for bowing and prostration] in a supererogatory prayer even if he does not have a reason for doing that, because it was narrated that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever prays standing, that is better; whoever prays sitting will have half the reward of one who prays standing; and one who prays lying down will have half the reward of one who prays sitting.” It is known that whoever prays lying down should tilt his head for bowing and prostration. So if it is permissible not to sit and prostrate even when one is able to do it, then it is permissible not to prostrate but still sit.\nAs for the view of ‘Isa, that he should not lean forward [for bowing and prostrating] in a supererogatory prayer when he has no excuse or reason to do that, based on his not accepting the hadith – like the view of Malik in al-Mudawwanah, that no one should pray lying down except one who is sick – therefore it is not permissible to refrain from sitting and prostrating unless there is a reason.\nIt may be that it is not permissible to lean forward for prostration when you are able to prostrate, except in the case of one who prays lying down, because the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The one who prays sitting will have half the reward of the one who prays standing.” All the scholars understood this hadith as referring to the one who prays sitting and prostrates, because it is not known that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), or any of the early generations of the ummah, omitted prostrating properly in a supererogatory prayer when they were able to do it, although he omitted standing in the prayer when he was able to do it.""(Al-Bayan wa’t-Tahsil\xa0 1/515-516).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\nMy grandmother is elderly, and standing in prayer is tiring for her, so she offers supererogatory prayers sitting on a chair. As for the obligatory prayers, she prays them standing, and she bows and prostrates properly. My question is: Is she sinning by sitting on a chair? If she is not sinning, is it better for her to pray on the ground or on the chair? Please note that the chair is more comfortable for her.\nHe replied:\nWith regard to the obligatory prayer, the matter is clear, because she is doing it as it should be done.\nWith regard to the supererogatory prayer, if she wants to pray sitting, then she may sit cross-legged on the ground instead of standing and when bowing, then get up after bowing and prostrate on the ground, and sit muftarishan [sitting with the right foot held upright on the toes, whilst sitting on the left foot] between the two prostrations, as usual. Then when she has done the second prostration, she should sit cross-legged, because sitting cross-legged is instead of standing. This is undoubtedly better than praying on the chair, because when preying on the chair, she cannot prostrate on the ground, and thus she misses out on prostration; but if she is able to prostrate, it is not permissible for her to lean forward instead.\nBased on that, we say: if your grandmother wants to offer supererogatory prayers, she should pray on the ground and do what we described above, sitting cross-legged instead of standing before bowing, when bowing and when rising from bowing, and she should sit muftarishan between the two prostrations and in the two tashahhuds, and prostrate on the ground.

21745,What is the ruling on a man having intercourse with his wife in the bathroom? Some people take a bath with their wives and may become aroused. What is the answer?,"[""Praise be to Allah.My brother, may Allah help you to do that which is good and make you satisfied with that which He has permitted you so that you will have no need for that which He has forbidden. What you have mentioned in your question may be answered by noting the following:\xa0\n\nThe modern kinds of washrooms in modern houses such as those in your country differ greatly from the places used in the past for relieving oneself, which were places where dirt, filth and impurities collected. Modern washrooms are not like that, rather they can be kept clean and there is no impurity in them. Therefore they are not like the places that people used for relieving themselves in the past, and there are obvious differences between them. On this basis, there is no real reason why one should not fulfil one's sexual desire in such places when necessary, in the manner that you mentioned.\nA man’s fulfilling his sexual desire with his wife may often happen as the result of stimulation, by looking or touching etc. Hence fulfilling his desire when it is provoked in such situations is a means of keeping himself chaste and lowering his gaze [from looking at other women]. This is what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught us to do, according to the Hadith narrated by Muslim (1403) from Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him), who says that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw a woman and he came to his wife Zaynab (may Allah be pleased with her), whilst she was tanning a skin and preparing it for dyeing, and he fulfilled his need. Then he went out to his companions and said: “Woman comes and goes in the shape of a devil [i.e., she causes temptation], so if any one of you sees a woman, let him go and have intercourse with his wife , for that will take away what he feels in his heart.” This was also narrated by Ahmad, 19403; Ibn Majah, 1853. Ibn Hibban narrated in his Sahih, 4171, that ‘Abdallah ibn Abu Awfa (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘No woman fulfils all her duties towards Allah until she fulfils all her duties towards her husband. If he asks her [for his conjugal rights] even when she is on the back of a camel, she should respond to him.’”\xa0\n\n\nAt the same time, the Muslim should not forget, when his desire is provoked, to bear in mind the intention of keeping chaste and of enjoying that which is good and permissible. Then doing that will be an act of righteousness on his part, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “In the intimacy of any one of you there is reward.” They said, “O Messenger of Allah, if any one of us fulfils his desire will there be reward for him in that?” He said, “Do you not see that if he does it in a prohibited way, that will be a sin on him? So if he does it in a permissible way, he will be rewarded for that.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1006, from the Hadith of Abu Dharr). A man should also recite the Du`a that was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) for this situation. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When any one of you wants to have intercourse with his wife, let him say: ‘Bismillaah, Allahumma jannibna ash-Shaytana wa jannib ash-Shaytana ma razaqtana (In the name of Allah, O Allah, keep the devil away from us and from that with which You may bless us)’, then if it is decreed that they should have a child from that, the devil will never be able to harm him.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 6388; Muslim, 1434, from the Hadith of `Abdallah ibn `Abbas)\n\n\xa0May Allah grant you strength and bless you.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21745/is-intercourse-in-the-bathroom-permissible-in-islam

The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him)\xa0said: ""Use whatever causes blood to flow, and eat the animals if the name of Allah has been mentioned before slaughtering them.""\xa0Reported by the group and the wording is of Al-Bukhari.\nIt is required that the mentioning of the name of Allah be at the intended time\xa0of slaughter, for if there is a significant delay between it and the slaughter, it would not suffice; as He, the Exalted, says (translation of the meaning): So eat of that [meat] upon which the name of Allah has been mentioned (Al-An`am 18) and the saying of the Prophet\xa0(peace and blessings be upon him): ""if the name of Allah has been mentioned before slaughtering them""; the word (upon it) indicates its presence, and that the mentioning should be at the time of the act, and because the mentioning is a condition for the act, its conjunction with it is considered, to validate its attribution to it.\nIt is required to pronounce (articulate) the Basmalah unless one is unable to speak, in which case a gesture suffices.\nFifthly: The blood must flow (this is mandatory).\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him)\xa0said: ""Use whatever causes blood to flow, and eat the animals if the name of Allah has been mentioned before slaughtering them.""\xa0It is necessary that the blood flows from the neck, from its bottom to the jaws, cutting the two jugular veins, which are thick veins surrounding the windpipe, and ideally, the windpipe - the air passage - and the esophagus - the food and drink passage - should also be cut, to remove the substance of the animal\'s life, which is the blood, and its pathways, which are the windpipe and the esophagus.\nThe Jurists have differed on what is sufficient to cut during slaughter as follows:\nThe Hanafis hold that it is mandatory to cut the windpipe, the esophagus, and one of the jugular veins.\nThe Malikis hold that it is mandatory to cut the windpipe and the jugular veins.\nThe Shafi`is and Hanbalis hold that what is mandatory is to cut the windpipe and the esophagus.\nThe preponderant opinion is that cutting the jugular veins suffices to make the slaughter permissible, whether the windpipe and esophagus are cut or not.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him)\xa0said: ""If only the jugular veins are cut, it should suffice; based on the Hadith and the meaning. And it is preferable to cut all; because it is quicker in causing the death of the animal, more effective in draining the blood, and purifies the meat from it."" End quote from ""Al-Kafi Fi Fiqh Al-Imam Ahmad"" (1/550).\nSheikh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him)\xa0said: ""Therefore, the correct opinion is that if the jugular veins are cut, the slaughter is permissible, even if the windpipe and esophagus are not cut."" End quote from ""Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti` `ala Zad Al-Mustaqni`"" (7/448).\nIf the animal is not under control, such as being stray or one which has fallen into a well or cave, etc., it suffices to cause the blood to flow from any part of its body, and it is preferable to aim for what would end its life more quickly; because it is more comfortable for the animal and less painful. In the Sahihain, from the Hadith of Rafi` ibn Khadij (may Allah be pleased with him):\xa0They were with the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him)\xa0on a military expedition, and they obtained camels and sheep, and a camel ran away, so a man shot it and immobilized it, and the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him)\xa0said: ""These camels are like wild animals. If any of you is overpowered by one of them, then do this.""\nSixthly: Differentiating in the method of slaughter between camels and other animals.\nRegarding the method and form of slaughter: The Sunnah is to differentiate in the method of slaughter between camels and sheep and cattle.\nFor camels: The Sunnah is that the slaughter is done by stabbing the camel in the lower part of the neck towards the chest in the hollow that is between the chest and the base of the neck, and it should be slaughtered\xa0standing with its left hand tied, as Allah says (translation of the meaning): Then mention the name of Allah upon them [as they line up for sacrifice] (Al-Hajj: 36). Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Standing on three legs, with its left hand tied. And from Jabir ibn `Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him): ""The Prophet (peace and blessings\xa0be upon him)\xa0and his Companions used to slaughter the sacrificial camels with the left hand tied, standing on what remained of its legs"". Reported by Abu Dawud (1767).\nAs for cattle and sheep, they are to be slaughtered lying on their side, and the slaughterer places his leg on the side of its neck to control it; as Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him)\xa0reported: ""The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him)\xa0sacrificed two horned rams, and I saw him placing his foot on their sides, mentioning the name of Allah and saying Allahu Akbar, and he slaughtered them with his (own) hand"". Reported by Al-Bukhari (5238).\nAs for chickens, we do not know of any specific Sunnah regarding how they should be slaughtered.\nThe valid way of slaughter is such\xa0that it (the chicken) is slaughtered by a Muslim or a person of the Book, and the name of Allah is mentioned upon it, and the blood is drained as previously explained.\nSummarized from the book (Rulings on Sacrifice and Slaughter by Sheikh Ibn `Uthaymin/with adaptation) and additions are confirmed in their places.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/288000/islamic-slaughter

21439,"This is regarding the Sahih Mutawatir Hadith of raising of the hands before and after the bowing in the Salat. This has been authentically reported in Sahih Al-Bukhari, Sahih Muslim, and Sunan Abu Dawud.","['Praise be to Allah.Reported Hadith about raising hands in prayer\nThe Hadith to which the questioner refers was narrated by Al-Bukhari (735) and Muslim (390) from `Abdullah ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), who said that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to raise his hands to shoulder level when he started to pray, when he said “Allahu akbar” before bowing in Ruku`, and when he raised his head from Ruku`.\xa0\nThe majority of scholars followed this Hadith and said that it is recommended for the worshipper to raise his hands at the points mentioned in the Hadith .\xa0\nImam Al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) wrote a separate book on this issue which he called Juz’ fi Raf` Al-Yadayn (Section on Raising the Hands), in which he proved that the hands should be raised at these two points on the prayer, and he strongly denounced those who go against that. He narrated that Al-Hasan (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The Companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to raise their hands during prayer when they bowed and when they stood up (from bowing).” Al-Bukhari said, “Al-Hasan did not exclude any of the Companions from that, and it was not proven that any one among the Sahabah did not raise his hands.”\xa0(See Al-Majmu` by An-Nawawi, 3/399-406)\nHadiths about not raising hands in prayer\nWe do not know whether the Hadiths about raising the hands reached Abu Hanifah (may Allah have mercy on him) or not, but they did reach his followers. But they did not follow them because they had other Hadiths and reports which said that the hands should not be raised except when saying “Allahu akbar” at the beginning of the prayer.\xa0\nThese Hadiths include the following: \xa0\nThe Hadith narrated by Abu Dawud (749) from Al-Bara’ ibn `Azib (may Allah be pleased with him), which says that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to raise his hands almost to his ears when he started to pray, then he did not repeat (this action).\nThe Hadith narrated by Abu Dawud (748) from `Abdullah ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: “Shall I not lead you in prayer as the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did?” Then he prayed and he only raised his hands once.\xa0(See Nasb Ar-Rayah by Az-Zayla`i, 1/393-407)\xa0\nBut these Hadiths were classed as inauthentic by the Imams of Hadith.\xa0\nThe Hadith of Al-Bara’ was classed as inauthentic by Sufyan ibn `Uyaynah, Ash-Shafi`i, Al-Humaydi the shaykh of Al-Bukhari, Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Yahya ibn Ma`in, Ad-Darimi, Al-Bukhari, and others.\xa0\nThe Hadith of Ibn Mas`ud was classed as inauthentic by `Abdullah ibn Al-Mubarak, Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Al-Bukhari, Al-Bayhaqi, Ad-Daraqutni and others. Similarly, the reports which were narrated from some of the Companions about not raising the hands are all inauthentic. We have quoted above the words of Al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him): “…it was not proven that any one among the Companions did not raise his hands.”\xa0(See Talkhis Al-Habir by Al-Hafidh ibn Hajar, 1/221-223)\xa0\nRuling on raising hands in prayer\nOnce it is proven that these Hadiths and reports which say that the hands should not be raised are inauthentic, then the Hadiths which say that the hands should be raised remain strong with no opposing reports.\xa0\nHence the believer should not fail to raise his hands at the points in prayer described in the Sunnah. He should strive to make his prayer like the prayer of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) who said, “Pray as you have seen me praying.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 631)\nHence `Ali ibn Al-Madini (may Allah have mercy on him), the shaykh of Al-Bukhari, said: “It is the duty of the Muslims to raise their hands when they bow in Ruku` and when they stand up from Ruku`.” Al-Bukhari said: “`Ali was the most knowledgeable of the people of his time.”\xa0\nOnce the Sunnah has been explained clearly, no one has the right to ignore it, following whoever among the scholars said that.\xa0 Imam Ash-Shafi` (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The scholars are agreed that if the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) becomes clear to a person, it is not permissible for him to ignore it in favour of the opinion of anyone.”\xa0(Madarij As-Salikin, 2/335)\xa0\n“If a man is following Abu Hanifah or Malik or Ash-Shafi`i or Ahmad, and he sees that the view of another Madhhab concerning a given matter is stronger, and he follows that, then he has done well, and that does not detract from his religious commitment or good character. There is no scholarly dispute on this point. Rather this is more in accordance with the truth and is more beloved by Allah and His Messenger.”\xa0(Said by Shaykh Al-Islam – may Allah have mercy on him – in Al-Fatawa, 22/247)\nThe scholars who said that the hands should not be raised based on their own Ijtihad are to be excused, for they will be rewarded for their Ijtihad and their seeking the truth, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If a judge passes judgement based on his own Ijtihad and he is correct, he will have two rewards; if he passes judgement based on his own Ijtihad and he makes a mistake, he will have one reward.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 7352; Muslim, 1716) (See Raf` Al-Malam `an Al-A’immah Al-A`lam by Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah)\nNote:\xa0\nThere is a fourth place where it is recommended to raise the hands during prayer; that is when standing up after the first Tashahhud for the third Rak`ah. \xa0\nMay Allah help us all to know the truth and follow it.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.\xa0 May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21439/raising-the-hands-in-prayer

170800,"I would like to know what is the criterion for a mosque? So in other words what are the necessary conditions a building/room must fulfil to be considered a Masjid? And if a place does not fulfil one of such criteria but the 5 congregational prayers are made routine in such a place, is it then the same as praying in congregation at home?.","['Praise be to Allah.What is a mosque?\nA Masjid or mosque is a place which is prepared for the purpose of offering the five daily prayers on a permanent basis and is devoted for that purpose.\xa0\nWhat makes a place a mosque?\nA place becomes a mosque when general permission is given to pray in it, whether it is stated clearly that it is a Waqf or endowment given for the sake of Allah, or it is not stated, according to the majority of scholars apart from the Shafa`is. (See Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah, 37/220)\xa0\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“A Waqf is valid if it is established verbally or by means of actions which indicate that, such as if a person builds a mosque and gives the people permission to pray in it, or he establishes a graveyard and gives people permission to bury the dead in it, because that is the custom and it indicates that something is a Waqf. So it is permissible to establish it by means of that (action), as it may also be established verbally. That is like when a person presents food to his guests.” (Al-Kafi, 2/250)\xa0\nA mosque is no longer the property of the one who establishes it, because it is a Waqf, so it is not permissible for him to sell it.\xa0\nDifference between a mosque and a prayer room\nThere are prayer rooms (Musallas) that are set up in offices and schools ; these do not come under the rulings on mosques because they are not established as Waqfs and as such they do not cease to be the property of their owners. Moreover, the five daily prayers are not held regularly in them in most cases.\xa0\nIt says in Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah (5/169): What is the difference between a mosque (Masjid) and a prayer room (Musalla)? What I mean is: Is offering the prayer to greet the mosque (Tahiyat Al-Masjid) obligatory in a prayer room or does it not come under that ruling? Or is it recommended?\xa0\nThey replied:\n“A mosque (Masjid) is a place that has been set aside for offering the obligatory prayers on a permanent basis and is devoted for that purpose. A prayer room or prayer place (Musalla) is a place that is used for prayer occasionally, such as the `Eid prayers, funeral (Janazah) prayers and so on, and it is not set aside as a Waqf for the five daily prayers. It is not Sunnah to offer the prayer to “greet the mosque” when entering a Musalla; rather it is Sunnah to offer this prayer when entering a mosque for one who wants to sit down in the mosque; he should do it before he sits down, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When one of you enters the mosque, let him not sit down until he has prayed two Rak`ahs.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim)\xa0\nAnd Allah is the source of strength. May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.”\xa0(Shaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn `Abdullah ibn Baz, Shaykh `Abdullah ibn Ghadyan, Shaykh Salih Al-Fawzan; Shaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz Al Ash-Shaykh, Shaykh Bakr Abu Zayd)\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about the difference between a mosque and a prayer room, and when a place may be regarded as a mosque.\xa0\nHe replied:\xa0\n“With regard to the general meaning, the entire earth is a mosque because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The earth has been made a place of prostration and a means of purification for me.”\xa0\nWith regard to the specific meaning, a mosque is a place that has been prepared for the purpose of prayer on a permanent basis and is allocated specifically for that, whether it is built of stones, mud or cement, or not. With regard to the prayer room or prayer place, it is a place that a person uses to pray in, but he does not make it a place for prayer on a permanent basis; rather he prays there if the time for prayer comes. This is not a mosque. The evidence for that is the fact that the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to offer optional prayers in his house, and his house was not a mosque. Similarly, `Utban ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) invited him (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to come to his house and pray in a place that `Utban could take as a prayer room or prayer place, and that place was not a mosque. So a prayer room is a place that is used for prayer without it being set up specifically as a public mosque in which the people can pray and that is known to have been set up specifically for that purpose.” (Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin, 12/394)\xa0\nFrom the above we may conclude that a mosque is a place that fulfils the following conditions:\xa0\n\nIt has been set aside as a Waqf and is no longer the property of the one who established it\nGeneral permission to pray in it has been given, i.e., anyone who wants to pray in it is not to be prevented from doing so\nIt is established for the purpose of offering the five daily prayers regularly and on a permanent basis.\n\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 4448 , 145198 , 70216 , and 191668 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/170800/what-is-a-mosque

The reason for their refusal is not legitimate, as looking down upon non-Arabs is a form of pre-Islamic tribalism that Islam has warned against. Allah Almighty says (interpretation of the meaning): O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Acquainted. [Quran 49:13].\nThe Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings\xa0be upon him)\xa0set religion and character as the criteria for accepting a spouse. Abu Hurairah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: ""If someone with whose religion and character you are satisfied asks for your daughter in marriage, comply with his request. If you do not do so, there will be temptation on Earth and extensive corruption."" [At-Tirmidhi 1084, Al-Albani classified it as sound in ""Sahih at-Tirmidhi""].\nLet the confrontation be in a wise manner, perhaps through a detailed and impactful letter you write to him (your father), while persistently supplicating to Allah to soften his heart and guide him to the right path.\nSecondly:\nThere is no fault on you at all for your eagerness to marry. It is incumbent upon the families of every man and woman who desire to marry to assist them in this matter as much as they can. A woman needs this assistance more than a man; because the decision is not in her hands, as she cannot, according to custom and tradition, propose to a man, even though it is permissible from a Shariah perspective. Since a woman is sought after and cannot be the seeker, she needs her family\'s help to enable her social availability. For example, her brother could recommend her to his friends whose\xa0religion and character he is satisfied with, and her mother could suggest her to her acquaintances who have sons suitable for marriage, and so on.\n`Umar ibn Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him)\xa0proposed his daughter Hafsah for marriage after her husband died, offering her to `Uthman and Abu Bakr, then the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) married her, as in Sahih Al-Bukhari (4005).\nAnd `Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) offered his daughter Umm Kulthum to `Umar ibn Al-Khattab, and he married her.\nThirdly:\nWe do not recommend marriage through internet sites, as there are many undesirable individuals there, and it is easy to deceive people through these sites. On the internet, a person can pretend to be ideal, and it is very difficult to know the truth of the matter. It might be the opposite of what you imagine. Therefore, we must restrain our emotions with the bridle of reason, unlike marriages based on real-life acquaintances.\nFourthly:\nRegarding your request for advice for your mother on the subject - which is the focus of your question - we in turn direct this message to your honorable mother, may Allah make her one of the keys to goodness.\nHonorable Mother...\nPeace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of Allah.\nOur honorable mother, one of the greatest responsibilities that Allah will question parents about, and which they are obligated towards their children, especially daughters, is facilitating their marriage. Delaying it for an illegitimate reason is non-compliance with the command of Allah Almighty who says 9Interpretation of the meaning): And marry the unmarried among you and the righteous among your male slaves and female slaves. [Quran 24:32]; meaning facilitate the marriage of those who are not married and marry them off. The commentators said: The verse commands guardians to marry off their daughters and not to leave them single - unmarried - because that is more chaste for them. So, we must comply with the command of Allah.\nKnow that looking at people based on nationality or ethnicity is due to customs dominating people\'s minds more than Shariah and reason.\nAnd all the good is in following the guidance of Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him): ""If someone with whose religion and character you are satisfied asks for your daughter in marriage, comply with his request. If you do not do so, there will be temptation on Earth and extensive corruption."" Narrated by At-Tirmidhi (1048) and others, and Al-Albani classified it as good.\nHow many a girl whose family refused to marry her off, and she became the temptation that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) warned against. So, be keen to marry her to the one she desires, if he is someone whose religion and character are satisfactory, and do not pay attention to customs that erode society. And may Allah take care of you.\nThe pre-Islamic customs that look at people based on nationality or ethnicity are ignorant customs with no basis in the religion of Allah; rather, Islam came to purify souls from them. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: ""Indeed, Allah has removed from you the pride of Jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic tribalism) and boasting about one\'s lineage. [A person is either] a pious believer or a miserable sinner. All of you are children of Adam, and Adam was created from dust."" Narrated by Abu Dawud (5116) and others, and Al-Albani classified it as good.\nIf anyone should be strict about such matters and refuse to marry his daughter to someone who is not from his people or skin color, then this should be discarded from the wise consideration (especially) in Western countries, where Muslims live as minorities, and the choices from ""nationalities"" are greatly reduced, and people\'s circumstances are constrained. Rather, Muslims in such countries should be more united than their normal circumstances in their home countries.\nMay Allah guide us and you to what is good for Muslims, and improve the conditions of Muslims, their homes, and their offspring.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/428339/parents-making-marriage-difficult

That is indicated by many hadiths, such as the following:\xa0\n\nAl-Bukhari (1108) narrated that Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) joined Maghrib and `Isha’ prayers when travelling.\xa0\nAhmad (3178) narrated from Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) joined two prayers whilst travelling. Shaykh Ahmad Shakir (3288) said: Its Isnad\xa0 (chain of narration) is authentic.\xa0\nMuslim (706) narrated that Mu’adh (may Allah be pleased with him) said: We went out with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) on the campaign of Tabuk, and he used to pray Dhuhr and `Asr together, and Maghrib and `Isha’ together.\xa0\n\nTypes of traveller\xa0\nA traveller may be of two types :\xa0\n\nWhen he is actually on the road\nWhen he has made a stop, i.e., he is not on the road; either he has reached the place to which he is travelling, or he has made a stop on his journey and stayed there for a while.\xa0\n\nIt is permissible for any traveller to join prayers , whether he has made a stop or is on the road.\xa0\nIs it better for the traveller to join the prayers?\nBut is it better for the traveller to join the prayers or to offer each prayer at its proper time?\xa0\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his essay on the times of the prayer (Mawaqit As-Salah, p. 26):\xa0\nIt is better for the traveller who has made a stop not to join the prayers , but if he joins them there is nothing wrong with that, unless he needs to join them because he is tired and needs to rest, or because it is hard for him to find water each time, and so on, in which case it is better for him to join the prayers and avail himself of the concession. But for the traveller who is on the road, it is better for him to join Dhuhr and `Asr , and Maghrib and `Isha’ – in the way that is easier for him, either praying them at the time of the earlier prayer or the time of the later prayer.\xa0\nBased on this, it is better for you to avail yourself of the concession, and join Dhuhr and `Asr at the time of Dhuhr , because this is easier for you. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was never given the choice between two things but he would choose that which was easier, so long as it was not a sin, in which case he would be the most careful of people to avoid it. (Narrated by Muslim, 3560 and Muslim, 2327)\nIn this case you have to strive to pray `Asr in congregation and look for someone to pray with you.\xa0\nCan you pray in the train sitting down?\nWith regard to praying `Asr in the train whilst sitting , this is permissible according to the majority of scholars, if you cannot pray standing .\xa0\nIt says in Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah (8/120):\xa0\n“If the time for prayer comes and the plane is still in the air and there is the fear that the time for prayer will end before it lands, then the scholars are agreed that the prayer must be offered in whatever manner one can, bowing, prostrating and facing the Qiblah if possible, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“So keep your duty to Allah and fear Him as much as you can.” [At-Taghabun 64:16]\nAnd the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If I tell you to do something, do as much of it as you can.” (Al-Bukhari and Muslim\xa0)\nBut if it is known that the plane will land before the time for prayer ends, and there will be enough time to offer the prayer or the prayer is one which can be joined with another – such as Dhuhr which may be joined with `Asr, or Maghrib which may be joined with `Isha’ – and it is known that the plane will land before the time for the second prayer ends and there will be enough time to offer the prayers, then the majority of scholars are of the view that it is permissible to offer the prayers in the plane, because it is obligatory to offer them when the time for prayer begins, in whatever manner one can, as stated above. This is the correct view.”\xa0\nAnd it also says (8/126):\xa0\n“It is not permissible to pray sitting down in a plane or elsewhere if one is able to stand, because of the general meaning of the verse (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And stand before Allah with obedience.” [Al-Baqarah 2:238]\nAnd the Hadith of `Imran ibn Husayn (may Allah be pleased with him) which was narrated by Al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him): that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to him: “Pray standing, and if you cannot, then sitting, and if you cannot, then on your side.” An-Nasa’i added, with an authentic Isnad: “And if you cannot, then lying on your back.””\xa0\nSome of the scholars are of the view that it is not permissible to pray in planes, trains or cars because it is not possible to offer the prayer as it is offered when standing on the ground – unless there is the fear that the time for the prayer will end.\xa0\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Fatawa Arkan Al-Islam (p. 380):\xa0\n“It is obligatory to pray in a plane if one does not know the time of the prayer, but if he cannot offer the prayer in the plane as he offers it on the ground, then he should not offer obligatory prayers in the plane if the plane will land before the time for prayer is over, or the time for the following prayer if it is a prayer that may be joined with another. For example, if a plane takes off from Jeddah just before sunset and the sun sets whilst it is in the air, he should not pray Maghrib until the plane lands and he disembarks. But if he fears that the time will end and he intends to join it to `Isha’ at the time of the latter, he can pray them when he lands. But if the plane keeps on flying and there is the fear that the time for `Isha’ will end, which is at midnight, then he should pray them in the plane before the time ends.”\xa0\nBased on this, in order to be on the safe side, you should not pray `Asr in the train , rather you should join it with Dhuhr at the time of Dhuhr, as stated above.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/49885/is-combining-prayers-when-travelling-permissible

Do I have to give zakah?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt is permissible to rent out the shop with what it contains of equipment in return for a monthly or annual sum. As for the trade goods that are sellable, it is not valid to rent them, because it is only possible to rent things that can be made use of whilst still remaining and not being consumed, such as devices, tools, shelves and so on. As for the goods, they are sold and do not remain.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Mughni (5/317): It is permissible to rent any item that can be used in a permissible manner whilst remaining as it is, such as land, houses, slaves, animals, clothes, ropes, tents, baskets, saddles, reins, swords, spears and so on.\nThen he said (5/319): What it is not permissible to rent is of different types, one of which is that which cannot be used without being consumed, such as food, drink and candles to be lit, because rental is a contract for use and benefit, and these things cannot be used except by consuming them. End quote.\nTherefore it is not permissible to rent the trade goods that are in the shop, and the tenant must return them to the owner or buy them from him. Therefore it should be said to the owner of the shop, Work out the price of these goods and sell them to the tenant – if he wants to buy them – for cash or by instalments, or take your goods and sell them to whomever you wish.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: There is a kind of business deal that is widespread among many people, which is called equipping shops. What it involves is as follows: a man comes to the owner of a shop, such as a car parts dealer, for example, and the like, and he says to him: I will rent your shop for three years, and I will give you ten thousand riyals every month, then after three years, I will give your shop back to you with the same goods that I received from you, in full. What is the ruling on this transaction?\nShaykh: The goods in the store belong to whom?\nQuestioner: To the first owner, based on the fact that he will return them to him after three years, in full.\nHe replied: This contract, in reality, is not valid, unless he says: Tell me the value of the goods that are there now, and they will become the property of the second owner, who will pay ten thousand riyals every month as rent for the shop, and the items in the shop will belong to the tenant, not to the owner; they will be his property, so any profit on them will be his and any loss on them will be borne by him. There is nothing wrong with that. As for what you mentioned, it is not permissible, because it is clearly ambiguous; it does not come under the heading of a partnership or of renting or of selling. So we think that it is not permissible. What ordinary people should do, if they want to get involved in these new types of business dealings, is to refer the matter to the scholars before getting involved in it.""(Liqa’ al-Bab al-Maftuh\xa0 44/10).\nSecondly:\nThere is no zakah on the shop or the equipment in it. As for zakah on the rent that you receive, if it reaches the minimum threshold (nisab) by itself or when added to your other wealth, and one full Hijri year has passed since it reached the minimum threshold, then at that time you should give one quarter of one tenth (2.5%).\nBut if you are not saving anything until one full Hijri year has passed, then you do not have to give zakah on it.\nIf this rent is mixed with your wealth, and you do not know that for which one full Hijri year has passed, then look at the wealth that you have at the end of the zakah year and give zakah on it, whatever the amount may be.\nAs for the goods, if you have sold them to the tenant, then you should give zakah on this cash when one zakah year has passed for the trade goods. Do not calculate a new zakah year from the time when you sell them; rather you should complete the year on the basis of the zakah year for the trade goods. If you have sold them to be paid for by instalments, then this is a debt that is owed by the purchaser.

39818,"My question is about the time for prayer. The time begins when the Adhan is given, but when does the time end? Is there a difference between delaying prayer and missing the time for prayer? And what is the punishment for both?","['Praise be to Allah.To find out about the times of prayer and when they begin and end, please see question no.\xa09940 .\xa0\nDifference between delaying prayer and missing the time for prayer\nWith regard to your question about the difference between delaying prayer and missing the time for prayer, the answer is as follows:\xa0\nMissing the time for prayer\nMissing the time for prayer means delaying the prayer until the time is over and one has not prayed. This is a major sin, unless that is for a legitimate excuse such as sleeping or forgetting.\xa0\nIt says in Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah, 10/8: “The jurists agreed that it is forbidden to delay prayer until the time for prayer is over, without a legitimate excuse.”\xa0\nShaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “With regard to the person who deliberately delays the prayer until after the time for it is over, or who sets his alarm clock late so that he will not get up on time, he is deliberately not praying, and he has committed a great evil according to all the scholars, but is this disbelief or not?\xa0\nHere there is a difference of opinion among the scholars:\xa0\nIf he does not deny that prayer is obligatory, then the majority of scholars say that he is not committing major disbelief\xa0 in this case.\xa0\nSome of the scholars were of the view that this is major disbelief which puts him beyond the pale of Islam, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Between a man and shirk [associating others with Allah] and disbelief\xa0 there stands his giving up prayer.” (Narrated by Muslim, 82)\nAnd the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The covenant that stands between us and them is prayer; whoever gives up prayer is a disbeliever.” (Narrated by Ahmad and the four authors of As-Sunan with an authentic Isnad [chain of narrators]) And there is other evidence to support this.\nIt was also narrated from the Companions of the Prophet (may Allah be pleased with them all).\xa0\nThe great Tabi’i ‘Abdullah ibn Shaqiq Al-`Aqili (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The Companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not think that omitting anything constituted disbelief apart from prayer.”\xa0\nIs it prohibited to delay prayer?\nWith regard to delaying prayer , this may refer to two things:\xa0\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Delaying the prayer until the time for that prayer is over. We have explained the ruling on this above.\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Delaying the prayer until the end of the time for that prayer.\xa0(See Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah, 10/6)\xa0\nIt is permissible to offer a prayer at the end of its time, because of the Hadith narrated by Muslim (614) from Abu Musa Al-Ash’ari (may Allah be pleased with him), that someone came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and asked him about the times of prayer… and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) explained to him the beginning and end of the time for each prayer, and said, “The time is between these two.”\xa0\nBut if delaying the prayer means that one will miss out on praying in congregation and will pray it alone at the end of its time, then it is prohibited because it means not praying in congregation, so long as one does not have an excuse for not praying in congregation.\xa0\nIs it Sunnah to delay `Isha’?\nIt is better to do the prayer at the beginning of its time, except for `Isha’ prayer , and also Dhuhr prayer when it is very hot; in these cases it is better to do them at the end of their allotted times.\xa0\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“It is better to do the prayer at the time required in the Shari`ah. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, answering the one who asked him which deed is most beloved to Allah, “Prayer done on time .” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 527 and Muslim, 85) He did not say prayer at the beginning of its time. That is because the prayers include some which it is Sunnah to pray sooner and some which it is Sunnah to pray later. It is Sunnah to pray `Isha’ later, after one-third of the night has passed. Hence if a woman is at home and asks which is better for me, to pray `Isha’ when I hear the Adhan or to delay it until one-third of the night has passed? We say, it is better to delay it until one-third of the night has passed, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) delayed one night until they said, “O Messenger of Allah, the women and children have fallen asleep,” so he went out and led them in prayer, and said, “This would be its time, were that not too difficult for my Ummah.” So if a woman is in her house, it is better for her to delay it.\xa0\nSimilarly, if it so happens that some men are travelling, and they ask whether they should pray `Isha’ sooner or later, we would tell them that it is better for them to delay it.\xa0\nSimilarly if a group goes out for a trip and the time for Isha’ comes, is it better for them to pray `Isha’ sooner or later? We say that it is better for them to delay it if that will not cause them any hardship.\xa0\nIn the case of the other prayers it is better to pray them sooner unless there is a reason for doing otherwise. So Fajr should be prayed sooner , Dhuhr should be prayed sooner , `Asr should be prayed sooner and Maghrib should be prayed sooner, unless there is a reason for doing otherwise. \xa0\nReasons for delaying prayer\xa0\nSuch reasons include the following:\xa0\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 If it is intensely hot, then it is better to delay Zuhr prayer until it cools down a little, i.e., until it is nearly time for `Asr, because it cools down a little when it is nearly time for `Asr. When it is intensely hot, it is better to pray when it is cooler, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When it is intensely hot, then wait until it cools down before you pray, for intense heat is from the breeze of Hell.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 537 and Muslim, 615)\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was on a journey and Bilal (may Allah be pleased with him) stood up to give the call to prayer, and he said, “Wait until it gets cooler.” Then [Bilal] stood up to give the call to prayer, and [the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)] said, “Wait until it gets cooler.” Then [Bilal] stood up to give the call to prayer, and [the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)] gave him permission to do so. (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 629 and Muslim, 616)\xa0\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Another reason is if it will be possible to pray in congregation at the end of the time but not at the beginning, in which case delay is preferable. For example, if a man is outside the city when the time for prayer comes, and he knows that he will reach the city and catch up with the congregation at the end of the time for prayer, is it better for him to pray when the time for prayer comes, or to delay the prayer until he reaches the congregation?\xa0\nWe say that it is better for him to delay the prayer until he catches up with the congregation; we say that it is even obligatory for him to delay in this case, so that he can catch up with the congregation.” (Fatawa Arkan Al-Islam, p. 287)\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/39818/is-it-prohibited-to-delay-prayer
139719,"Is it permissible to wipe, when doing wudu, over what is worn on my head, such as a cap or shemagh?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThere are soundly narrated hadiths from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) which indicate that it is permissible to wipe over the turban when doing wudu. These hadiths refer to two ways of doing it:\nThe first way:\nis wiping over the forelock [the front of the head] and turban. It was narrated from al-Mughirah ibn Shu‘bah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did wudu, and he wiped over his forelock and over his turban and over his khuffs. Narrated by al-Bukhari (182) and Muslim (274).\nThe second way:\nis wiping over the turban only. It was narrated that ‘Amr ibn Umayyah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I saw the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) wiping over his turban and khuffs. Narrated by al-Bukhari (205).\nImam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) acted in accordance with these hadiths. See: Kashshaf al-Qina‘ (1/120).\nThe majority of scholars are of the view that it is not valid to only wipe the turban when doing wudu, and that if someone does that, his wudu is not valid. We have discussed this previously and noted that the view of Imam Ahmad is more likely to be sound, in the answer to question no. 129557 .\nSecondly:\nWith regard to the views of the imams regarding wiping over the turban, the cap and so on:\nAccording to the Shafa‘is, part of the head must be wiped, then it is recommended (mustahabb) to carry on and wipe over the turban.\nAn-Nawawi said in al-Majmu‘ (1/440):\nOur companion said: If he is wearing a turban and does not want to take it off for some reason, or even if there is no reason, he may wipe over all of his forelock, and it is recommended for him to carry on and wipe over the turban, whether he put it on in a state of purity or otherwise. If he is wearing a cap on his head and does not want to take it off, then it is like a turban, and he must wipe his forelock, and it is recommended for him to carry on and wipe over the cap too.\nThe ruling is the same with regard to what a woman wears on her head, but if a man only wipes over the turban and does not wipe over any part of his head, then that is not valid, and there is no difference of opinion regarding that in our view. End quote.\nThe Shafa‘is allowed wiping over the turban and cap, on condition that part of the head also be wiped. This is based on the fact that what is obligatory in wudu, in their view, is wiping part of the head, and it is not required to wipe the entire head. Hence they said that carrying on to wipe over the turban or cap Is recommended (mustahabb), but if they are not wiped over, wudu is still valid.\nIn the answer to question no. 70530 , we stated that the correct view is that it is obligatory to wipe over the entire head when doing wudu, and this is the view of Imam Malik and Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on them).\nAccording to the Malikis, it is not permissible to wipe over the turban except in the case of necessity, which is if the wearer fears harm if he takes it off. If part of his head is uncovered, he must wipe it, then carry on and wipe over the turban, and this is obligatory, as it says in Hashiyat al-‘Adawi (1/195).\nIt says in ash-Sharh al-Kabir (1/163), which is a Maliki book:\nIf he can wipe over part of his head, he should do that, then carry on wiping over the turban, and this is obligatory according to the correct view. End quote.\nAs for the Hanafis, they disallow wiping over the turban, despite the fact that there are hadiths which allow it.\nSee: Hashiyat Ibn ‘Abidin (1/181).\nAs for the Hanbalis, who allow wiping over the turban, the reason they gave for allowing it is that it is difficult to take it off. Based on that, wiping over the cap is not permissible, because there is no difficulty involved in taking it off.\nAl-Bahuti al-Hanbali said:\nIt is not permissible to wipe over the large shawl [which is something that a woman wears over her head cover], because it is not difficult to take it off, so it is like the cap for a man, and it is not permissible to wipe over a cap. The reason why it is not allowed to wipe over them is because it is not difficult to take them off, so it is not permissible to wipe over them.""(Kashshaf al-Qina‘\xa0 1/384).\nIbn Qudamah said in al-Mughni (1/384):\nIt is not permissible to wipe over the cap. This was stated by Imam Ahmad. End quote.\nThus it becomes clear that wiping over a cap and the like is not valid. Similarly, it is not valid to wipe over the shemagh, ghutrah or kufiyah (keffiyah) – these words all refer to the same thing [i.e., the scarf or headdress worn by Arab men in Saudi Arabia and other countries], except according to the madhhab of Imam ash-Shafa‘i, provided that part of the head is also wiped. This is because, as noted above, wiping the entire head is not obligatory according to Imam ash-Shafa‘i; rather what is obligatory is wiping part of it.\nContemporary scholars have issued fatwas stating that it is not permissible to wipe over the cap, shemagh and so on.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIt is permissible to wipe over a turban, for a man. The turban is that which covers the head and is wrapped around it, and that is something that is well known.\nThe evidence for it being permissible to wipe over it is the hadith of al-Mughirah ibn Shu‘bah (may Allah have mercy on him), according to which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) wiped his forelock, and over his turban, and over his khuffs. The turban may also be called a khimar (head cover), as in Sahih Muslim: “He wiped over his khuffs and khimar. He said: That is, the turban.” Thus the word khimar was explained as referring to the turban. Were it not for this explanation, we would have said that it was permissible to wipe over the ghutrah if it is covering the head, just as it is permissible for a woman to wipe over her khimar.""(Ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘\xa0 1/236).\nShaykh Ibn Jibrin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe cap is something that is worn on the head to protect it from the sun and heat, and it is shaped to fit the size of the head, but does not usually cover the ears. Therefore it cannot be compared to the turban with regard to wiping over it, because there is no difficulty in removing it. End quote.\nShaykh Salih al-Fawzan (may Allah preserve him) said:\nThe cap is not like the turban, and various types of caps and head covers do not come under the same ruling as the turban. The turban in particular is what is mentioned in the Sunnah with regard to it being permissible to wipe over it, so it should be limited to that.

197798,,"['Praise be to Allah.Does not praying constitute disbelief?\nNot praying at all constitutes disbelief that puts one beyond the pale of Islam, according to the correct scholarly opinion.\xa0\nWith regard to the person who prays sometimes and does not pray at other times some of the scholars are of the view that he is also a disbeliever, which is the view narrated from a number of the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them), and is also the view cited in Fatwas of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas which was headed by Shaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him).\xa0\nOther scholars are of the view that he does not become a disbeliever unless he does not pray at all , such as Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) and Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him).\xa0\nDo you have to make up missed prayers?\nThe scholars differed concerning the one who deliberately does not pray (such as one who is too lazy to pray , and the like): does he have to make up the prayers , as is required of one who sleeps and misses a prayer or one who forgets, and is it in fact more appropriate that the one who does not pray without any excuse should be instructed to make up the prayer, rather than the one who does have an excuse, as is the view of the majority of scholars, and the four Madhhabs and others are agreed on this point?\xa0\nOr is it the case that he does not have to do that, and if he does make them up it will not benefit him, either because not praying constitutes disbelief and the prayer of the disbeliever does not benefit him so long as he remains a disbeliever, and he is not instructed to make up what he missed during the time when he was a disbeliever and apostate; or because every act of worship is connected to a particular time, and if a person does not do it at the proper time with no legitimate excuse, it will not be accepted from him, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does an action that is not part of this matter of ours will have it rejected” (Narrated by Muslim, 1718)?\xa0\nThe ruling on shortening the prayer when not travelling is no different from the ruling on not praying at all. If a person offers a prayer but omits one Rak‘ah or prostration, or he omits one of its pillars or essential parts deliberately, his prayer is invalidated and he is like one who did not pray it at all. He is closer to toying with the rituals, and such a person is in grave danger, if Allah does not bestow His mercy upon him and bless him by enabling him to repent sincerely.\xa0\nIt was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Allah enjoined the prayer on the lips of your Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him); four Rak‘ahs when not travelling, two Rak‘ahs when travelling, and one Rak‘ah at times of fear. (Narrated by Muslim, 687).\xa0\nIbn Hazm (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The number of Rak‘ahs does not change (when travelling) except in the case of Dhuhr, ‘Asr and ‘Isha’: they are four Rak‘ahs when not travelling, for both healthy and sick individuals, two Rak‘ahs when travelling and one Rak‘ah at times of fear. There is scholarly consensus on all of that, except with regard to whether these prayers may be offered with one Rak‘ah at times of fear – there is a difference of opinion concerning that.” (Al-Muhalla, 3/185)\xa0\nCan one combine prayers without reason?\nIt is not permissible to join two prayers together without an excuse; if a person joins prayers together without any excuse or legitimate justification for doing so, then he is sinning, because he is going against the Shar`i texts that regulate the prayer, such as the verse in which Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, the prayer is enjoined on the believers at fixed hours” [An-Nisa’ 4:103].\xa0\nAnother such text is the Hadith in which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Jibril (peace be upon him) led me in prayer at the Ka`bah twice. He led me in praying Dhuhr when the sun had passed the meridian and the shadow was the length of a sandal-strap; then he led me in praying `Asr when the (length of a thing’s) shadow was equal to its height; then he led me in praying Maghrib at the time when the fasting person breaks his fast; then he led me in praying `Isha’ at the time when the red afterglow had disappeared; then he led me in praying Fajr at the time when food and drink become prohibited to the one who is fasting. Then the next day he led me in praying Dhuhr when the (length of a thing’s) shadow was equal to its height; then he led me in praying `Asr when the (length of a thing’s) shadow was equal to twice its height; then he led me in praying Maghrib at the time when the fasting person breaks his fast; then he led me in praying `Isha’ when one third of the night had passed; then he led me in praying Fajr when it had grown light. Then he turned to me and said: O Muhammad, these are the times at which the Prophets before you prayed, the time is between each of these two times (for each prayer).” (Narrated by Abu Dawood, 393 and At-Tirmidhi, 149; Al-Albani said: Its Isnad (chain of narration) is authentic, in Sahih Abu Dawud – Al-Umm, no. 417)\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The Muslims unanimously agreed that the five daily prayers are to be offered at certain times which are well-known and strictly defined, and several authentic Hadiths have been narrated concerning that.” (Al-Mughni, 1/224)\xa0\nOnce this is established, it is not permissible to join two prayers together unless there is a reason to do so, such as travel , rain , or sickness . If there is no reason for joining prayers together, then you should abide by the original timings for the prayers. (Al-Mughni by Ibn Qudamah, 2/60)\xa0\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) defined the timings of the prayer in detail, doing the prayer at any other time constitutes transgressing the limits set by Allah. “And whoever transgresses the limits ordained by Allah, then such are the Dhalimoon (wrong-doers)” [Al-Baqarah 2:229]. Whoever offers a prayer before its time, knowingly and deliberately, is sinning and has to repeat it, but if he did not do that knowingly and deliberately, then he is not sinning, but he does have to repeat it. This applies to joining two prayers together at the time of the earlier prayer with no legitimate reason; the prayer that was brought forward is not valid and he has to repeat it.\xa0\nIf a person delays a prayer until after its time, knowingly and deliberately, with no excuse, he is sinning and his prayer is not accepted, according to the more correct scholarly opinion. This applies to joining two prayers together at the time of the later prayer with no legitimate reason. The prayer that was delayed will not be accepted, according to the more correct scholarly opinion.\xa0\nThe Muslim has to fear Allah, may He be Exalted, and not be careless with regard to this extremely important matter.” (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 15/387)\xa0\nWhat you must do now is repent to Allah sincerely from what you have done, and mend your ways in the future. You have to make yourself respect the issue of prayer, which is the greatest duty that Allah requires of His slaves.\xa0\nIf you err on the side of caution and try hard to make up the prayers that you missed, especially those which you shortened or joined together when you were not travelling, with no legitimate excuse, that will be better for you and is more likely to ensure that you have discharged your obligations.\xa0\nYou should also do a lot of supererogatory actions, as much as you can, especially supererogatory prayers. Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And perform the prayer (Iqamat-as-Salat), at the two ends of the day and in some hours of the night (i.e. the five compulsory Salat (prayers)). Verily, the good deeds remove the evil deeds (i.e. small sins). That is a reminder (an advice) for the mindful (those who accept advice).\nAnd be patient; verily, Allah loses not the reward of the good-doers.” [Hud 11:114-115].\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/197798/is-combining-prayers-without-reason-permissible

That is because of the report from Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: When my father was killed, I started to lift the cloth from his face whilst I was weeping, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not forbid me to do that. `A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: I saw the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) kiss `Uthman ibn Math`un after he died, and I even saw his tears flowing. And she said: Abu Bakr came to see the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) when he was wrapped in a striped cloak [after he died]. He uncovered his face, then he leaned over him and kissed him, then he wept and said: May my father be sacrificed for you, O Prophet of Allah; Allah will not cause you to die twice. These Hadiths are authentic.” (Al-Mughni, 2/350)\xa0\nThese Hadiths indicate that it is recommended to cover the face of the deceased , and they also indicate that it is permissible to enter upon the deceased, uncover his face and kiss him , whether that is after he is shrouded or before. The Hadiths of Abu Bakr and Jabir (may Allah be pleased with them) speak of what happened after death and before shrouding ; the Hadith of `Uthman ibn Math`un\xa0 (may Allah be pleased with him) speaks of what happened after shrouding , as is clearly mentioned in Al-Bukhari (1243): When he died, and was washed and shrouded in his garments, the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came in.\nIn conclusion, the basic principle is that the face of the deceased is to be covered, but it is permissible to uncover it in order to kiss him or look at him. However there is no basis in Islamic teachings for regarding that as obligatory, and there is nothing to indicate that it is obligatory or even recommended.\nIf it is the people’s custom in your country for the family of the deceased to look at him before burying him, and if not doing that will make people think that they have failed to give him his right or it is seen as sign of disrespect, then you should not go against their wishes in that regard, because this comes under the heading of reconciling between people and removing mutual resentment and grudges, as well as paying attention to adopting a gentle approach and explaining the Sunnah to them gradually, and correcting the beliefs and traditions that they have.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/241149/can-you-uncover-the-deceaseds-face-to-kiss-him

Afterward, the fat cells that have been frozen die, and then the body gradually disposes of the melted fat through the liver or kidneys.\nThe doctor, in the fat-dissolving sessions, first anesthetizes the area to be treated with local anesthesia, and it is possible to also use a moisturizing cream to protect the skin from the cold temperature. Then, the doctor moves the Cryoshape device over the area and during this, gradually lowers its temperature until it reaches 5 degrees Celsius. Usually, the procedure does not exceed one hour per session.\nSecondly:\nThe use of this method to get rid of fat is permissible, with conditions:\nFirst: It is predominantly assumed that there is no harm.\nSecond: It should be done by a husband, or a woman, as long as the patient is a woman, and the purpose of the procedure is for improvement, and not for a therapeutic need.\nThird: If the fat is in the area of the \'awrah, which is between the navel and the knees, and the doctor is not the woman\'s husband, it is required that there be a need, such that the fat is excessive and cannot be eliminated by exercise or the like, and not merely for beauty and improving the figure; because the basic principle is the prohibition of a woman looking at the \'awrah of another woman.\nAbu Sa\'id Al-Khudri said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: ""A man should not look at the \'awrah of another man, nor should a woman look at the \'awrah of another woman"" Reported by Muslim (338).\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his explanation of Muslim: ""It is forbidden for a man to look at the \'awrah of another man, and for a woman to look at the \'awrah of another woman, and there is no disagreement on this.

246225,I want to know in detail the rulings for the one who is late for the congregational prayer.,"['Praise be to Allah.Who is considered late for prayer?\nIt says in Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah (3353):\n“The one who is late for the congregational prayer is the one who comes when the Imam has already done all or some of the Rak`ahs of the prayer.”\nRulings related to joining the congregational prayer late\nSome of the rulings concerning the one who is late for the congregational prayer:\n\nIt is recommended for the one who is late for the congregational prayer to come to the mosque in a calm and dignified manner. He should understand that whatever he catches up with of the prayer with the Imam is regarded as the start of his prayer. So if the one who is late for the prayer catches up with the Imam in the second Rak`ah of Maghrib prayer – for example – this Rak`ah is regarded as the second Rak`ah for the Imam and the first Rak`ah for him.\n\nThe evidence for these two rulings is the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “When you hear the Iqamah, then walk to the prayer and be calm and dignified. Do not rush, and whatever you catch up with, pray, and whatever you miss, complete it.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 600)\nSome of the scholars made an exception for the one who fears that he will miss out on the congregational prayer altogether; he may hurry somewhat, so as to catch up with the congregational prayer.\n\nIf\xa0the one who is late for the prayer catches up with it when the Imam is bowing, then he must say the Takbirat Al-Ihram (opening Takbir, which is said to commence the prayer) whilst standing. If he says it whilst bending forward, his prayer is not valid.\n\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“It is obligatory to say the Takbierat Al-Ihram whilst standing. This also applies to one who is late for the prayer and catches up with the Imam when he is already bowing. His Takbierat Al-Ihram must be enunciated properly whilst he is standing; if he pronounces any letter of it when he is not standing, he has not started his prayer, and there is no difference of scholarly opinion concerning that.” (Al-Majmu`, 3/296)\n\nIf the one who is late for the prayer comes when the Imam is bowing, then to be on the safe side he should say Takbir twice: the first one for Takbirat Al-Ihram, and the second one for the Takbir of bowing. If he says Takbirat Al-Ihram only, then bows without saying the Takbir for bowing, that is acceptable according to the correct scholarly opinion.\n\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\nIf a worshipper joins the prayer when the Imam is bowing, should he say the opening Takbir and the Takbir for bowing, or should he say just one Takbir and then bow?\nAnswer:\n“It is preferable and more prudent for him to say two Takbirs: one for Takbirat Al-Ihram, which is an essential part of the prayer and must be said when he is standing, and the second is the Takbir of bowing, which he should say as he is bending down forRuku`. If he is afraid of missing the Rak`ah, then Takbirat Al-Ihram is sufficient according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions, because they are two acts of worship to be done at the same time, so doing that which is more important will suffice for that which is less important, and this Rak`ah will be valid, according to most of the scholars.” (Majmu` Fatawa Ibn Baz, 11/245)\n\nIf the worshipper joins the prayer when the Imam is bowing, this Rak`ah will count as valid, even if he does not say the Tasbih until after the Imam has stood up.\nIf the one who is late for the prayer does not know whether he caught up with Ruku` (bowing) with the Imam or not, then in this case he should act on the basis of what he thinks most likely to be the case. If he thinks it most likely that he caught up with the Imam when he was bowing, then he has caught up with the Rak`ah;\xa0 if he thinks it most likely that he did not catch up with him when he was bowing, then he is not regarded as having caught up with the Rak`ah.\n\nIt says in Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti‘ (3/383) by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him):\n“Question: Someone comes when the Imam is bowing, and he says Takbirat Al-Ihram then bows, then he is not sure whether he caught up with the Imam in Ruku‘ or the Imam stood up before he caught up with him.\nAccording to the author’s view, this Rak`ah is not to be counted as valid, because this person is not sure whether he caught up with it (the Rak`ah) or not. So he should proceed on the basis of what is certain, which is that he did not catch up with it, therefore this Rak`ah does not count.\nAccording to the second view – which is that he should proceed on the basis of what he thinks most likely to be the case – we say: Do you think it most likely that you caught up with the Imam when he was bowing, or not? If he says: Yes, I think it most likely that I caught up with him when he was bowing, then we say: This Rak`ah counts in your case. But if he says: I think it most likely that I did not catch up with it, then we say: Do not count this Rak`ah, and complete your prayer (on that basis).\nIf he says: I am not sure, but I do not think it most likely that I caught up with it, then we say: Proceed on the basis of what is certain; do not count this Rak`ah, and complete your prayer.”\n\nIt is permissible for the one who is late for the prayer to pray behind the row on his own, if he cannot find space in the row in front of him.\nIf the Imam does an extra Rak`ah by mistake, should the one who was late for the prayer count that extra Rak`ah (as part of his own prayer)? Concerning this issue there is a difference of opinion among the scholars.\n\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\nIf the Imam prays five Rak`ahs and someone joins the prayer late in the second Rak`ah, should he say the Salam with the Imam or add a Rak`ah (after the Imam has finished)?\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) replied:\n“The scholars differed concerning this issue. Some of the scholars said that when the Imam who prayed five says the Salam, the one who was late for the prayer must do another Rak`ah , so that he will have prayed five as his Imam did. The evidence for that is the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “Whatever you catch up with, pray; and whatever you have missed, complete it.” They (the scholars) said: This man missed a Rak`ah (with the Imam), so he must do it.\nBut the more correct view is that it is not permissible for him to do a fifth Rak`ah ; rather he should say the Salam with the Imam in this case, because the Imam did the fifth Rak`ah with a valid excuse (which is that he forgot), but this man has no excuse after knowing that he has prayed four Rak`ahs. Therefore it is not permissible for him to add something to the prayer.\nThe response concerning the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), “and whatever you have missed, complete it” is to note that the word “complete it” indicates that because of what he has missed, his prayer is lacking, and if he had prayed four Rak`ahs with the Imam, his prayer would not be lacking. This is the answer to the one who quotes this Hadith. And Allah knows best.” (Majmu‘ Fatawa Ibn `Uthaymin, 20/14)\n\nIf the Imam does the prostration of forgetfulness (Sujud As-Sahw) before the Salam, then the one who was late for the prayer should prostrate with him , whether he was with the Imam when he made that mistake or he joined the prayer after the Imam made the mistake. But if the Imam does the prostration of forgetfulness after the Salam, then the one who was late for the prayer should not follow his Imam in that prostration, because it is not possible for him to follow the Imam in this case.\xa0\nThe one who was late for the prayer is not regarded as having caught up with the prayer in congregation unless he caught up with at least one Rak`ah of the prayer. One can only catch up with the Rak`ah by catching up with Ruku‘ (bowing).\n\nIt says in Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah (vol. 2, 6/225):\n“The one who was late for the prayer has not caught up with the prayer in congregation unless he catches up with one Rak`ah, according to the correct view, because of the Hadith: “Whoever catches up with a Rak`ah of the prayer has caught up with the prayer.” (Narrated by Muslim). One catches up with the Rak`ah by catching up with Ruku‘ (bowing).”\n\nIf the one who is late for the prayer comes after the final Ruku‘, then it is still better for him to join the Imam, and not look for another congregation.\n\nIt says in Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah (vol. 2, 6/225):\n“If the Muslim comes after the final Ruku‘, it is better for him to join the Imam in whatever he has caught up with , because of the general meaning of the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “When you come to the prayer, then come in a tranquil manner, then whatever you catch up with, pray, and whatever you have missed, complete it.” This includes both what comes before the final Ruku‘ and what comes after it.”\n\nThe one who was late for the prayer is not regarded as having caught up with Jumu‘ah if\xa0he misses Ruku` (bowing) in the second Rak`ah. If he comes after the Imam has stood up from bowing in the second Rak`ah of Jumu`ah prayer, then he has missed Jumu`ah . So he should join the Imam (for the remainder of the prayer), then complete it as Thuhr [with four Rak`ahs] after the Imam says the Salam.\xa0\nIn order to be on the safe side, the one who was late for the prayer should not stand up to make up what he missed of the prayer until after the Imam has finished saying the second Taslimah .\n\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/246225/rulings-on-joining-the-congregational-prayer-late

(Classed as authentic by Shaykh Al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) in Sahih Sunan At-Tirmidhi)\xa0\nThe Hadith of Bilal (may Allah be pleased with him) indicates that it is recommended to persist in doing Wudu, and that it is recommended to offer a prayer immediately after doing Wudu.\xa0\nThere is nothing in the Hadith to indicate that it is recommended to do Wudu for every supererogatory prayer.\xa0\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\nThis indicates that it is recommended to pray following Wudu, that doing so is Sunnah and that it is permissible to do so at times when offering (unspecified supererogatory) prayers is disallowed: at sunrise, when the sun is at its zenith, at sunset, and after Fajr and `Asr prayers, because it is a supererogatory prayer that is done for a specific reason. This is our view.” (Sharh Muslim by An-Nawawi, 8/13)\xa0\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“This Hadith indicates that it is recommended to keep oneself in a state of purity.” (Fath Al-Bari, 3/35)\xa0\nIs it recommended to renew Wudu?\nThe scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) stated: Renewing Wudu is only recommended for one who prayed after doing the first Wudu.\xa0\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Our companions unanimously agreed that it is recommended to renew Wudu , which is when a person had Wudu, then does Wudu again without having invalidated his Wudu.\xa0\nWhen is it recommended? There are five views concerning that, the soundest of which is if he offered a prayer, obligatory or supererogatory, with the first Wudu (then it is recommended to do Wudu for another prayer).” (Al-Majmu`, 1/495)\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Majmu` Al-Fatawa (21/376):\xa0\n“Rather the jurists’ discussion has to do with the one who prayed with the first Wudu: is it recommended for him to renew his Wudu?”\xa0\nWith regard to one who did not pray with the first Wudu, it is not recommended for him to renew Wudu . Rather renewing Wudu in this case is a Bid‘ah (innovation) and is contrary to the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and the way of the Muslims both during his lifetime and after his death, until the present time.”\nWhen is it not recommended to renew Wudu?\nAn exception is made to it being recommended to renew Wudu if one of the two prayers was connected to the other, such as the regular Sunnah prayers that are connected to obligatory prayers, or Tarawih followed by Witr, or if the two prayers are joined together, as in the case of one who joins Maghrib and ‘Isha’ together. In such cases it is not recommended to renew Wudu, because there is no report of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) doing that.\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“It is proven via Mutawatir reports that on the day of `Arafah the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) led the Muslims in praying Thuhr and ‘Asr, joining the two prayers together, and thousands prayed behind him whose numbers are known only to Allah. When he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said the Tasleem at the end of Thuhr, he led them in praying ‘Asr; neither he nor anyone else repeated his Wudu, nor did he instruct anyone to repeat his Wudu, and no one transmitted any report to that effect. This indicates that renewing Wudu is not recommended in all cases.\xa0\nSometimes he would offer an obligatory prayer and then a supererogatory prayer, and sometimes he would offer a supererogatory prayer and then an obligatory prayer, and sometimes he would offer an obligatory prayer then another obligatory prayer, all of that with one Wudu.\xa0\nSimilarly, the Muslims would pray behind him at night in Ramadan with one Wudu, on numerous occasions.\xa0\nThe Muslims at his time would do Wudu, then they would pray so long as they did not invalidate their Wudu, as is mentioned in authentic Hadiths. There is no report from him – either with an authentic or inauthentic Isnad (chain of narration) – to indicate that he instructed them to do Wudu for every prayer.

The material of the teeth is not the same as the bone. Although there are similarities, there are huge differences. when the Prophet said teeth are bone, was he speaking in a medical and scientific way, classifying teeth as bone, or was he noting their similarities, like analogy or metaphorical? if he classified teeth as bone, then it\'s completely incorrect. Based on this, can we say that it wasn\'t said by the Prophet? Perhaps one of the narrators added it, or this hadith can be rejected, as the Prophet of Allah can\'t provide incorrect information.

And I will tell you about that: As for the tooth, it is a bone, and as for the claw, it is the knife of the Abyssinians."" Reported by Al-Bukhari (2488), and Muslim (1968).\n\xa0The intent here is to inform of what is impermissible to use for slaughtering, and the Messenger of Allah prohibited slaughtering with a bone because it is\xa0not sharp, which leads to the suffering of the animal being slaughtered, and this is not from the kindness in slaughtering (compassion) that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him)\xa0commanded out of compassion for the animal.\nThe intent of the Messenger of Allah is that the tooth is like the bone, lacking an edge sufficient for proper slaughter.\nRegarding the meaning of the hadith, another interpretation is mentioned in ""Ad-Dibaj"" (5/35), which states:\n""As for the tooth being a bone"": it means do not slaughter with it; because it becomes impure with blood, and I have forbidden\xa0you from using bones for cleaning yourselves\xa0so as not to make them impure, as they are the sustenance of your brothers from the jinn.""\nAccording to this opinion, the prohibition of slaughtering with the tooth is because this would spoil it for the jinn who eat it, so the tooth is from the bone that the jinn eat, and therefore, this has no relation to anatomical precision, but rather it is related to the general category of bones eaten by the jinn, even if it differs from the anatomical bone in some way.\nIndeed, if we contemplate the same hadith, we find that the prohibition of slaughtering with the claw is because it is a ""knife""; so is the claw a knife in the terminology of ""metallurgists"" or weapon makers in what a knife is?\nThe answer is no. The intent is that the Abyssinians used it as a knife because it shares the function of a knife, which is the ability to cut.\nIndeed, the jurists do not all agree on equating ""the tooth"" with ""the bone"" in the same jurisprudential ruling, let alone the anatomical description. Imam Abu Al-`Abbas Al-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him)\xa0said:\n""And (his saying: \'And I will tell you, as for the tooth, it is a bone. And as for the claw, it is the knife of the Abyssinians\'): The apparent meaning of this is that it is from the speech of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him)\xa0and it is an indication of the rationale for prohibiting slaughtering with the tooth because it is a bone, and thus, the prohibition from the tooth extends to every bone, whether connected or disconnected. An-Nakha\'i, Al-Hasan Ibn Salah, Al-Laith, and Ash-Shafi`i adopted this view. And the jurists among the companions of Hadith prohibited slaughtering with the bone and the claw, however they may be, and permitted it with anything else due to the Hadith. And this is one of the opinions of Malik, as previously mentioned.

(Narrated by Abu Dawud, 1396; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud)\xa0\nWhen praying Qiyam Al-layl, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) recited Al-Baqarah, An-Nisa’ and Al `Imran in a single Rak`ah, as was narrated by Hudhayfah (may Allah be pleased with him). (Narrated by Muslim, 772)\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“It is permissible for a person to recite two or three Surahs after Al-Fatihah , or he may limit himself to just one, or he may divide a Surah in two halves (split between two Rak`ahs). All of these are permissible, because of the general meaning of the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“So, recite you of the Quran as much as may be easy for you” [Al-Muzzammil 73:20]\nAnd the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Then recite whatever you can of the Quran.”\xa0(Majmu` Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 13/question no. 500)\xa0\nShaykh Al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would sometimes recite two or more Surahs in one Rak`ah.” (Sifat Salat Al-Nabi (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), p. 103-105. The Shaykh (may Allah have mercy on him) quotes the Hadiths which have been narrated concerning that, along with their Isnads (chains of narration).)\n[This book by Shaykh Al-Albani is available in English under the title The Prophet’s Prayer Described – Translator].\xa0\nCan you recite Surah Al-Ikhlas in every Rak`ah?\nWith regard to reciting Surah Al-Ikhlas after every recitation in every Rak`ah, it is narrated that one of the Companions did that and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) approved of it. This is among the evidence concerning the basic question, which is reciting two Surahs in each Rak`ah.\xa0\n`Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sent a man in charge of a raiding party, and he used to lead his companions in prayer, always ending his recitation with Qul Huwa Allahu ahad. When they returned, they mentioned that to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and he said, “Ask him why he does that.” They asked him and he said, “Because it is a description of the Most Merciful, and I love to recite it.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Tell him that Allah loves him.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhaari, 6940; Muslim, 813)\xa0\nThis Hadith indicates that it is permissible to recite Surah Al-Ikhlas in every Rak`ah, although it is not recommended because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not do it or persist in doing it, and the best of guidance is the guidance of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/69915/can-we-recite-more-than-one-surah-in-a-rakah

Is this considered as major shirk? not calling up on them and asking them anything or relying upon them etc. but if someone were to say ‘o Jinn are you there’ or ‘o angel are you here’ etc, would this be considered major shirk? Some people when a loved one has passed away, go to his or her grave and talk to the deceased as if he is still alive. (If they don’t ask anything of him and they only talk, what is the Islamic ruling on this?) If someone were to visit an abandoned place and says ‘o jinn are you here, is this considered major shirk?

Nor is it legislated for us to communicate with them, as this is a realm of the unseen; they see us but we do not see them, and they hear our speech but we do not hear theirs. If communication with them were legislated, permission for it would have been given in the Book of Allah or the Sunnah of His Messenger, peace and blessings be upon him.\nUndoubtedly, such actions open the doors to whispers and illusions that one is better off without, leading to conjecture based on falsehood, speaking without knowledge, and perhaps, if one imagines their response and interaction, to asking them for help, seeking their support, or calling upon them in times of hardship; otherwise, such calling and speaking is futile and meaningless!\nWhat is legislated concerning the deceased is visiting them, greeting them, and praying for them, not speaking and conversing with them.\nOne should occupy themselves with what benefits them and beware of indulging in illusions, affectation, and innovation.\nSecondly:\nAddressing a jinni, an angel, or a deceased person constitutes shirk if it involves supplication to them, which includes requesting a need, attracting benefit, or repelling harm; such as seeking refuge with jinn, calling upon them for help, or requesting that from the deceased or an angel.\nAllah Almighty says(interpretation of the meaning): And there were men from mankind who sought refuge in men from the jinn, so they [only] increased them in burden.

So when the jinn saw that mankind sought refuge with them out of their fear of them, they [only] increased them in burden meaning: fear, terror, and panic, until they remained more fearful of them and sought refuge with them more, as Qatadah said: they [only] increased them in burden meaning: sin, and the jinn grew bolder over them with that.""

81949,Is bath (Ghusl) obligatory after wet dreams or do you have to do it only after sexual intercourse? What are the other conditions when a Muslim has to take a bath (Ghusl)?,"['Praise be to Allah.Ghusl may be obligatory or it may be sunnah and encouraged. The scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) have described all cases, and their comments may be divided into three categories:\xa0\nCases in which Ghusl is required according to consensus:\xa0\n\nEmission of Maniy (semen) even if it is not through intercourse.\n\nIt says in Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah (31/195):\xa0\n“The jurists unanimously agreed that emission of Maniy (semen) is one of the things that make Ghusl obligatory. An-Nawawi narrated that there was consensus on this point. No distinction is made between men and women, or whether one is asleep or awake. The basic principle concerning that is the Hadith of Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Water is for water (i.e., Ghusl must be done when semen is emitted).” (Narrated by Muslim, 343). What this means, as was stated by An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him), is that it becomes obligatory to do Ghusl with water if gushing water is emitted, i.e., semen.” Please see also questions no.\xa06010 ,\xa012317 \xa0and\xa047693 .\xa0\n\n\xa0Meeting of the two circumcised parts when the tip of the penis disappears completely in the vagina, even if no ejaculation takes place. Please see questions no.\xa07529 \xa0and\xa036865 .\xa0\nMenstruation and postpartum bleeding.\n\nIn Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah (31/204) it says: \xa0\n“The jurists unanimously agreed that menstruation and postpartum bleeding are among the things that make Ghusl obligatory. Ibn Al-Mundhir, Ibn Jarir, At-Tabari and others\xa0 (may Allah have mercy on them) narrated that there was consensus on this point. The evidence that Ghusl is required following menses is the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“They ask you concerning menstruation. Say: that is an Adha (a harmful thing for a husband to have a sexual intercourse with his wife while she is having her menses), therefore, keep away from women during menses and go not unto them till they are purified (from menses and have taken a bath). And when they have purified themselves, then go in unto them as Allah has ordained for you” [Al-Baqarah 2:222]”\xa0\nCases when Ghusl is not required according to consensus, but it is encouraged\xa0\n\nEvery time one is going to meet people – it is encouraged to do Ghusl beforehand.\n\nAl-Baghawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“It is encouraged for the one who wants to meet with people to do Ghusl, clean himself and perfume himself. That includes doing Ghusl on the two `Eids. An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Majmu` (2/233): ""It is encouraged for everyone according to consensus, men, women and children, because it is part of adoring oneself.” Please see question no.\xa048988 .\xa0\nThat also includes doing Ghusl before the eclipse prayer, prayers for rain (Istisqa’), standing in `Arafah, doing Ghusl in Al-Mash’ar Al-Haram, before stoning the Jamarat on the days of Tashriq, and other places where people gather to do acts of worship or gather according to their customs.\xa0\n\nWhen undergoing any physical change.\n\nAl-Muhamili (may Allah have mercy on him) – who was a Shafi`i jurist – said: “It is encouraged to do Ghusl every time one undergoes a physical change.” \xa0\nFor example, the jurists stated that it is encouraged for the one who went insane or fell unconscious to do Ghusl when he recovers, and to do Ghusl after cupping, after entering the Hammam and so on, because the Ghusl will remove anything that has gotten onto the body and will restore it to a natural state.” (See Al-Majmu`, 2/235, 234)\xa0\n\nFor some acts of worship, such as doing Ghusl when entering Ihram .\n\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did Ghusl before changing into his Ihram garments.\xa0 (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 830)\xa0\nThe jurists stated that it is encouraged to do Ghusl for Tawaf Az-Ziyarah and Tawaf Al-Wada` (farewell Tawaf), and on Laylat Al-Qadar. When Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) entered Makkah he would do Ghusl, and he said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to do that. (Narrated by Al-Bukhaari,\xa0 1478 and Muslim, 1259)\nCases where scholars differed on the obligation of Ghusl\n\nGhusl for the deceased.\n\nThe majority of scholars are of the view that death is one of the things that make Ghusl obligatory, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to the women when his daughter died: “Wash her three times or five or more than that.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhaari, 1253 and Muslim, 939)\xa0\n\nGhusl after washing the deceased.\n\nThe scholars differed concerning this, based on their differences about the Hadith that was narrated concerning it. It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever has washed a dead person, let him do Ghusl.”\xa0(Narrated by Ahmad, 2/454, Abu Dawud, 3161 and At-Tirmidhi, 993, who said it is a sound Hadith. Imam Ahmad said in Masa’il Ahmad by Abu Dawud, 309: No Hadith is proven concerning this) \xa0\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti’ (1/411): “The correct view is that it is encouraged.” Please also see question no.\xa06962 .\xa0\n\nGhusl on Fridays\n\nAn-Nawawi said in Al-Majmu` (2/232): “It is encouraged according to the majority, and some of the salaf regarded it as obligatory.”\nThe correct view is that which was favoured by Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) in Al-Fataawa Al-Kubra (5/307): “It is obligatory to do Ghusl on Fridays for one who is sweaty or has an odour that may offend others.”\n\nWhen a disbeliever becomes Muslim\n\nThe Malikis and Hanbalis are of the view that if a disbeliever becomes Muslim, Ghusl is required, because of the report narrated by Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that Thumamah ibn Athal (may Allah be pleased with him) became Muslim, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Take him to the garden of Banu so and so and tell him to do Ghusl.” And it was narrated that when Qays ibn `Asim became Muslim, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told him to do Ghusl with water and lotus leaves. And in most cases the new Muslim will not be free of Janabah (ritual impurity due to intercourse), so Ghusl is required for that reason. \xa0\nThe Hanafis and Shafi`is are of the view that it is encouraged for a disbeliever to do Ghusl when he becomes Muslim even if he is free of Janabah, because many people became Muslim and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not tell them to do Ghusl. If a disbeliever becomes Muslim when he is in the state of Janabah, then he has to do Ghusl.\xa0\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “This was stated by Al-Shafi`i, and the majority of our companions agreed on that.”\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymien (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti` (1/379): “In order to be on the safe side he should do Ghusl.”\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/81949/when-is-ghusl-not-required
417716,"My son is 8 years old and I have concerns regards his behaviour. When he speaks he sounds feminine and his body actions also appear a little as to how girls behave. He is home schooled and attends a tuition centre 3 days per week where there is only 1 other boy in his class. I\'m not sure if this is having an effect on his behaviour. My daughters friend noticed the way he is speaking and said to my daughter that he sounds odd. I continually tell him to speak nicely and not to behave in a girlish fashion. I\'m really worried and not sure what to do and why he is behaving in this way. I feel that if this continues, he may be picked on by other children and I just desire for him to behave in a more boyish manner. With living in the west and the fitnah of transgender and homosexuality all around, this is a huge concern.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe described behavior in the question is scientifically known as ""feminine bodily/physical expression,"" and the truth is that feminine bodily expression does not necessarily relate to sexual orientation. Often, it is a natural part of a person\'s character, and sometimes it is due to limited interaction with males. However, to judge that this is an expression of a deviant sexual inclination or a disorder in sexual identity requires more evident and deeper considerations.\nIf we assume that the description is accurate and that the boy indeed exhibits feminine bodily/physical expression, we must deal with the problem within these limits, without undue fears. Excessive fears may lead to incorrect methods of treatment, especially since, as described in the question, these feminine expressions are few. Therefore, we fear that the apprehension may affect the accurate assessment of the situation.\nSecondly:\nOne of the incorrect methods of treatment is to alert the boy to change his bodily/physical expression, as this actually produces counterproductive results. The correct approach here is to ignore the matter in terms of not alerting the boy, not in terms of avoiding the correct methods of treatment. The intention is to avoid drawing the boy\'s attention to the issue, as this exacerbates the problem and confuses the boy. However, we will pursue the correct methods to address the matter.\nThirdly:\nThe correct methods of treatment are based on creating a masculine environment for the boy to interact with, and suggestions for such an environment include:\n1- Connecting the boy with a Quran memorization group or a Shaykh who teaches him and establishes a relationship that makes the boy emulate him.\n2- Enrolling the boy in masculine sports, such as martial arts.\n3- The boy reads stories about the Companions, especially the knights and warriors among them, and then you ask the boy to present these stories in the form of a play, making this a regular activity for you.\nIt is also beneficial for the boy to memorize a significant number of these inspirational sayings from the heroes of the Companions, especially in situations of jihad, battles, sacrifice, and martyrdom, and to get used to reciting them eloquently, in a tone where he imitates these heroes.\nIt is also useful for him to watch meaningful Islamic animated films with heroic themes, such as ""Muhammad Al-Fatih"" and the film ""Wa Islamah,"" and other educational and inspirational films.\n4- And the most important of these steps: The father should take the boy to men\'s activities, men\'s gatherings, and men\'s meetings, especially in mosques, Islamic centers, and righteous environments. He should ask him to introduce himself to the men, to greet them, to look them in the eyes, and to express himself confidently.\nThis regular accompaniment and consistent training will transition the boy into the world of men and their ways of bodily expressing themselves.\nWe ask Allah for your success and protection from tribulations.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/417716/how-to-deal-with-a-male-child-who-is-behaving-feminine
33694,I hope that you can explain to us the status of prayer in Islam.,"['Praise be to Allah.Prayer occupies a great status in Islam that is not shared by any other act of worship. This is indicated by the following:\xa0\n\nPrayer is the pillar of the religion , which cannot stand without it.\xa0\n\nAccording to a Hadith narrated by Mu’adh ibn Jabal (may Allah be pleased with him), the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Shall I not tell you of the head of the whole matter and its pillar and top?” I [Mu’adh] said, “Yes, O Messenger of Allah.” He said, “The head of the matter is Islam, its pillar is prayer and its top is Jihad.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 2616; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Tirmidhi, 2110)\xa0\n\nPrayer is second in status to the Shahadatayn (the Two Testimonies of Faith) as further proof of the soundness of a person’s belief and as visible evidence of the beliefs that reside in the heart. \xa0\n\nThe Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Islam is built on five [pillars]: the testimony that there is none worthy of worship but Allah and that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger, establishing prayer, paying Zakah, performing pilgrimage to the House, and fasting Ramadan.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 8; Muslim, 16)\xa0\nEstablishing prayer means performing prayer in full with all its words and actions, at the appointed times, as it says in the Quran (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Verily, As-Salah (the prayer) is enjoined on the believers at fixed hours” [An-Nisa’ 4:103] i.e., at defined times.\xa0\n\nPrayer occupies a special position among other acts of worship because of the way in which it was enjoined.\xa0\n\nIt was not brought down to earth by an angel, rather Allah wanted to bless His Messenger Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) by taking him up to heaven and addressing him directly concerning the obligation of prayer. This is something that is unique to prayer among all the rituals of Islam.\xa0\nPrayer was enjoined on the night of the Mi`raj [Prophet’s ascent to heaven], approximately three years before the Hijrah.\xa0\nFifty prayers (per day) were enjoined at first, then the number was reduced to five, but the reward of fifty remains. This is indicative of Allah’s love of prayer and its great status.\xa0\n\nAllah erases sins by means of prayer.\n\nAl-Bukhari (528) and Muslim (667) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said – and in the Hadith of Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) it is narrated that he heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say – “What do you think if there was a river by the door of any one of you and he bathed in it five times a day, would there be any trace of dirt left on him?” They said, “No trace of dirt would be left on him.” He said, “That is like the five daily prayers, by means of which Allah erases sin.” \xa0\n\nPrayer is the last part of religion to be lost, and if it is lost the whole religion is lost.\xa0\n\nIt was narrated that Jabir ibn ‘Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Between a man and Shirk [associating others with Allah] and Kufr [disbelief] there stands his giving up prayer.” (Narrated by Muslim, 82)\xa0\nHence the Muslim should be keen to perform the prayers on time, and not be lazy or take the matter lightly. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“So woe unto those performers of Salah (prayers) (hypocrites), Those who delay their Salah (prayer from their stated fixed times)” [Al-Ma’un 107:4-5]\nAnd Allah warns those who cause their prayers to be lost by saying (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Then, there has succeeded them a posterity who have given up As-Salah (the prayers) [i.e. made their Salah (prayers) to be lost, either by not offering them or by not offering them perfectly or by not offering them in their proper fixed times] and have followed lusts. So they will be thrown in Hell” [Maryam 19:59]\n\nPrayer is the first thing for which a person will be brought to account on the Day of Resurrection.\n\nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “The first deed for which a person will be brought to account on the Day of Resurrection will be his prayer. If it is good then he will have prospered and succeeded, but if it is bad then he will be doomed and have lost. If anything is lacking from his obligatory prayers, the Lord will say, ‘Look and see whether My slave did any voluntary prayers, and make up the shortfall in his obligatory prayers from that.’ Then all his deeds will be dealt with likewise.” (Narrated by An-Nasa’i, 465; At-Tirmidhi, 413.

330611,"A man has a broken back and cannot bend forward very far, so when wiping over the socks, either his wife wipes over them for him, or if he is outside the house, he uses a broom, for example, and wets it, then wipes over the top of the socks in the well-known manner. Sometimes, if there is no broom available, he sprinkles water on the socks using a spray bottle so as to cover the top of the sock. Is his prayer valid in the two cases mentioned above, or does he have to repeat his prayers? Some people put on khuffs or shoes made of thick leather, that are known to all people, over socks that cover the ankles, then instead of wiping they pour water on the shoe. Is it Islamically acceptable to pour or sprinkle water on the socks or khuffs in the case of need or otherwise? What is the ruling on the person’s prayer in this case too?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt is permissible for a person to wipe over the khuffs of another person, as it is permissible for him to help him to do wudu’.\nIbn ‘Abidin (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his commentary on al-Bahr al-Ra’iq (1/182): If a person tells someone else to wipe over his khuffs and he does that for him, it is valid, as it says in al-Khulasah. End quote.\nSecondly:\nIt is not stipulated that the wiping should be done directly with the hand. So if the wiping is done with a cloth or a wetted broom – as you mentioned – it is permissible.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Majmu‘ (1/549): Our companions said: It is valid to wipe with the hand, or with a finger, or a piece of wood, or a piece of cloth, or something else. End quote.\nThis is the view of the Hanbalis. Please see: al-Insaf (1/160, 1/185).\nThirdly:\nIt is valid to sprinkle water on the khuffs with a spray bottle and the like.\nZakariyya al-Ansari said: If he puts his wet hand on the khuff without passing the hand over it, or he drips water onto it, that is valid.\nEnd quote from Sharh Manhaj at-Tullab ma‘a Hashiyat al-Bujayrami (1/88).\nFourthly:\nIf the shoes cover the ankles and were put on after purifying oneself completely, it is permissible to wipe over them, because that comes under the same ruling as khuffs. But if the shoes do not cover the ankles, then it is a matter concerning which there is a difference of scholarly opinion as to whether it is permissible to wipe over them.\nThe majority are of the view that it is not permissible to wipe over such shoes. However some scholars – such as al-Awza‘i, Ibn Hazm and Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) – were of the view that it is permissible to wipe over them. Shaykh al-Islam limited that to sandals that are difficult to take off except by using a hand or foot.\nThe evidence which indicates that it is permissible to wipe over sandals is as follows:\n1.\nThe report narrated by al-Bazzar, according to which Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) did wudu’ with his sandals on his feet; he wiped over them and said: This is what the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to do.\nIts isnad was classed sahih by Ibn Hajar in ad-Dirayah fi Takhrij Ahadith al-Hidayah (1/83).\n2.\nThe report narrated by Ibn Dawud (16) from Aws ibn Abi Aws ath-Thaqafi, which says that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did wudu’ and then wiped over his sandals and feet. Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud.\n3.\nThe report narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah from Abu’-z-Zabyan, who said: I saw ‘Ali urinate whilst standing, then he did wudu’ then wiped over his sandals, then the mu’adhdhin gave the call to prayer, so he took them off.\nIt says in al-Furu‘ (1/160): Our shaykh [i.e., Ibn Taymiyah] favoured the view that it is permissible to wipe the foot and sandals that are difficult to remove except by using a hand or foot, as is mentioned in the reports. He said: It is sufficient in this case to wash or wipe most of the foot itself, or what is apparent of it, and that is more appropriate than wiping part of the khuff. End quote.\nSee: al-Muhalla (1/336) and al-Insaf (1/179).\nAs for the majority of scholars, some of them regarded these hadiths as da‘if (weak), and some of them interpreted them as referring to wiping over sandals that are worn over socks.\nAccording to this view, if the sandals were put on over socks, it is permissible to wipe over both of them, because of the report narrated by at-Tirmidhi (99), an-Nasa’i (125), Abu Dawud (159) and Ibn Majah (559) from al-Mughirah ibn Shu‘bah, who said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did wudu’ wiping over his socks and sandals. This hadith was classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud.\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his commentary on Sunan Abi Dawud: What appears to be the case is that he wiped over socks over which sandals were worn. This is what is to be understood from the report, because they are mentioned separately… Moreover, what was narrated from ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab concerning that is that he wiped over the straps of the sandals that went over the top of the foot, along with the socks. As for the bottom part of the foot and heel, he did not wipe over them. End quote.\nIt was narrated in ‘Awn al-Ma‘bud that at-Tahawi said: He wiped over sandals under which there were socks, and his aim in doing so was to wipe over the socks, not the sandals.

147381,"I have moved to live in a new city, because of my studies. I went to the mosque to pray Maghrib and the Imam put together the Maghrib and `Isha’ prayers. Although I know that there are reasons for putting prayers together, I do not have complete knowledge about that. So I went and asked him why he had put the prayers together, and he said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) join prayers together because of rain, and because there is snow outside, we put the two prayers together. Is putting prayers together in the case of snow permissible? What are all the reasons for which prayers may be put together?","['Praise be to Allah.Joining prayers together because of snow\nThe Sunnah indicates that it is permissible to join Maghrib and `Isha’ together because of rain . Muslim (705) narrated from Sa‘id ibn Jubayr (may Allah have mercy on him) that Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) joined together Thuhr and `Asr, and Maghrib and `Isha’ , in Madinah when there was no fear and no rain. I said to Ibn ‘Abbas: Why did he do that? He said: So that his Ummah would not be subjected to hardship.\nIt is permissible to join prayers together because of snowfall, by analogy with rain.\nIt says in\xa0Kashf Al-Qina`: And it is permissible to join Maghrib and `Isha’ together, but not Thuhr and `Asr, because of snow and hail, because they come under the same ruling as rain.\nAnd it is permissible to join Maghrib and `Isha’ together because of ice, because the weather will be very cold.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said with regard to joining prayers together because of hail: It is not permissible except on condition that the hail be accompanied by cold winds that could harm people, or if it is accompanied by snow, because when snow falls it undoubtedly causes trouble. In that case, it is permissible to join prayers together.\nIt should be noted that the Hanbali Madhhab is the most easy-going Madhhab concerning excuses that make it permissible to join prayers together. We will list these excuses here, so as to for the readers benefit.\nWhen can you join prayers together?\nAl-Bahuti (may Allah have mercy on him) said in\xa0Kashshaf Al-Qina`\xa0(2/5):\n“Chapter on joining prayers together… It is permissible to join Thuhr and `Asr together at the time of either of them, and to join Maghrib and `Isha’ together at the time of either of them. These four are the prayers that can be joined together: Thuhr and `Asr, and Maghrib and `Isha’, at the time of either of them, either the first or the second.\nThat may be done in eight cases:\n\nFor the traveller for whom it is permissible to shorten the four-Rak`ah prayers , so long as his journey is not disliked or prohibited.\n\n\nFor one who is sick, for whom not joining prayers together will cause hardship and toil. It is proven that it is permissible to join prayers together for the woman who is suffering from Istihadah (irregular bleeding), which is a kind of sickness. Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) argued that sickness is more difficult than travel, and he was treated with cupping after the sun set, then he ate supper, then he joined the prayers together.\n\n\nFor one who is breastfeeding, because of the difficulty caused by a great deal of impurity. That is, it is difficult to purify it for every prayer. Abu Al-Ma`ali (may Allah have mercy on him) said: She is like one who is sick.\nOne who is unable to purify himself with water or to do Tayammum for every prayer, because joining prayers together was permitted for one who is travelling and one who is sick because of difficulty, and the one who is unable to purify himself for every prayer comes under the same ruling as them.\n\n\nOne who is unable to work out the time, such as one who is blind and one who is underground, as referred to by Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him); he mentioned it in\xa0Ar-Ri`ayah.\n\n\nOne who is suffering from Istihadah and others who come under the same ruling, such as one who is incontinent and constantly passes urine or emits Madhiy, or suffers constant nosebleeds, and the like. That is because of what is mentioned in the Hadith of Hamnah (may Allah be pleased with her), when she consulted the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) about Istihadah, and he said: “If you are able to delay Thuhr and bring `Asr forward, then do Ghusl and pray Thuhr and `Asr together, and then delay Maghrib and bring `Isha’ forward, then do Ghusl and offer the two prayers together, then do that.” (Narrated by Ahmad, Abu Dawud, and At-Tirmidhi who classed it as authentic). The one who is suffering from urinary incontinence and the like comes under the same ruling.\n\n\nOne who has work or an excuse that makes it permissible not to pray Jumu`ah and prayers in congregation, such as one who fears for his life or his wealth.\n\nWhen can you join Maghrib and Isha only together?\nThe abovementioned excuses make it permissible to join Thuhr and `Asr together , and Maghrib and `Isha’ together .\nHowever, there are other excuses that make it permissible to join Maghrib and `Isha’ together  in particular. There are six of these, which he explained as follows:\n\nIt is permissible to join Maghrib and `Isha’ together in the event of rain that soaks one’s clothes, or soaks one’s shoes or body, and which causes hardship. Al-Bukhari narrated with his Isnad (chain of narration) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) joined Maghrib and `Isha’ together on a rainy night. Abu Bakr, ‘Umar and ‘Uthman (may Allah be pleased with them) did likewise. But it is not permissible to join prayers together because of drizzle, or because of light rain that does not soak one’s clothes, according to our Madhhab, because that does not cause hardship.\nIt is permissible to join Maghrib and `Isha’ together, but not Thuhr and `Asr, in the event of snow and hail, because they come under the same ruling as rain.\nIt is permissible to join Maghrib and `Isha’ together in the event of ice because the weather will be very cold, and in the case of mud and intense cold wind. Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) said in the report of Al-Maymuni (may Allah be pleased with her): Ibn ‘Umar would join prayers together on a cold night. And he added in\xa0Al-Madhhab\xa0and\xa0Al-Mustaw‘ab\xa0and\xa0Al-Kafi: If it was dark. Al-Qadi said: And if there is any mention of him not attending prayer in congregation because of the cold, there should be added: or when it is muddy, because the hardship caused by cold is not greater than the hardship caused by mud. This is indicated by the report of Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) which says that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) join prayers together in Madinah when there was no fear and no rain, and there is no way to understand this report except meaning that there was mud. That is, assuming there was no sickness [that would prevent him from attending the prayer]. Al-Qadi said: This is more likely to be the case, and is better than understanding it to mean that there was no excuse at all and it is better than suggesting that this ruling is abrogated. So it is permissible to join prayers together in the case of these excuses, even for one who prays in his house or who prays in his local mosque under the arcade, or for one who is staying in the mosque, and the like, such as the one between whose house and the mosque there are only a few steps, even if he will not be harmed except a little. That is because in the case of a general concession, it makes no difference whether hardship is present or not, as in the case of travel. Rather this is limited to joining Maghrib and `Isha’ together because the reports only speak of this case, and the hardship involved is greater as these prayers are offered when it is dark, and the hardship of travel is because of travelling and the fear of having no travelling companions.”\n\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) thought it more likely to be the case that one may join Thuhr and `Asr together too in such situations, if hardship is involved.\n“He (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The correct view regarding this issue is that it is permissible to join Thuhr and `Asr together too in such situations, just as it is permissible to join Maghrib and `Isha’ together. The reason for that is hardship. If there is hardship, whether by night or by day, it is permissible to join prayers together.” (Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti‘, 4/393)\nAnd he (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“If it is intensely cold, with wind that is harmful to people, then it is permissible to join together Thuhr and `Asr, and Maghrib and `Isha’, because of the proven report in\xa0Sahih Muslim\xa0from ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) joined prayers together in Madinah when there was no fear and no rain. They said to Ibn ‘Abbas: What was the aim behind that? He said: He did not want his Ummah to be subjected to hardship. This indicates that the wisdom behind permitting joining the prayers together is to relieve the Muslims of hardship, otherwise it would not be permissible to join prayers together. The hardship in the case of cold is only when it is accompanied by cold winds. If there is no wind, then a person can protect himself against the cold by wearing layers of clothing, and he will not be harmed by the cold. Hence if someone were to ask us: Is it permissible to join prayers together just because it is very cold? We would say: It is not permissible, unless the cold is accompanied by a cold wind that harms people, or if it is accompanied by snow, because when snow falls it undoubtedly causes trouble. In that case, it is permissible to join prayers together. But if someone joins prayers together just because it is cold, this is not a legitimate excuse to allow him to join the prayers together. Whoever joins two prayers together for no legitimate reason is sinning and the prayer that he joins together with the earlier prayer is not valid and does not count; rather he must repeat it. If he joins them together at the time of the later prayer, then the first prayer is not offered at its time, so he is sinning by doing that. I wanted to point out this issue, because some people told me that they joined prayers together two nights ago because of the cold, without there being any wind that harms people, and this is not permissible for them.” (Liqa’ Al-Bab Al-Maftuh, 18/1)\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/147381/can-you-pray-thuhr-and-asr-together
466628,"We all know that being distracted during the Jumu‘ah khutbah is wrong. The evidence for that is the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “Whoever touches the pebbles has engaged in an idle action.” But it was narrated that there was a man who was causing a disturbance, and Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) threw a pebble in his direction, then when the person who was causing the disturbance turned around, Ibn ‘Umar put his hand over his mouth. What is meant by that is a gesture telling the other man to be quiet and stop disturbing people. So can we say that the hadith of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) only forbids the one who is causing a disturbance and not the one who is telling him to be quiet, or does it include both of them? Because if Ibn ‘Umar had not stopped that man, he would have carried on causing a disturbance and no one would have been able to listen attentively to the khutbah.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe hadith to which you refer in your question was narrated by Muslim, and tells us that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever touches the pebbles has engaged in an idle action.” Narrated by Muslim (857).\nAl-Qadi ‘Iyad (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Regarding the words “Whoever touches the pebbles has engaged in an idle action,” that is because by moving them and distracting himself with them, he becomes engaged in idle action and distracts others from listening to the khutbah with the noise that he makes by moving them.""(Ikmal al-Mu‘allim bi Fawa’id Muslim\xa0 3/253).\nClearer than that is the hadith of Abu Hurayrah, according to which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If you tell your companion to be quiet and listen on Friday when the imam is delivering the khutbah, you have engaged in idle talk.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (892).\nThese hadiths do not mean that someone should not alert the one who is talking or doing something during the khutbah [and tell him to stop] by means of gestures, as Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) did.\nAsh-Shirazi said: Speaking is not allowed, which means either that it is better not to speak or that one must not speak, according to the two different scholarly views. Rather the way to do that is to indicate by means of a gesture telling him to be quiet.""(Al-Mafatih fi Sharh al-Masabih\xa0 2/322).\nIt is soundly narrated from the Sahabah that they would gesture to one who spoke during the khutbah.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If a person hears someone talking – that is, during the khutbah – he should not tell him to stop by speaking, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If you tell your companion to be quiet and listen on Friday when the imam is delivering the khutbah, you have engaged in idle talk.” But he may gesture to him, as was stated by Ahmad, by putting his finger on his mouth.\nAmong those who thought that one should gesture and not speak were: Zayd ibn Suhan, ‘Abd ar-Rahman ibn Abi Layla, ath-Thawri, al-Awza‘i, and Ibn al-Mundhir…\nThis is indicated by the fact that when someone said to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) [i.e., during the khutbah]: When will the Hour be? The people gestured to him in the presence of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to be quiet.\nAnd as gesturing is permissible even in the prayer, which is invalidated by normal talk, it is more apt that it should be permissible during the khutbah.""(Al-Mughni\xa0 3/198).\nSecondly:\nWhat you referred to about Ibn ‘Umar throwing a pebble was narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah, from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), that he saw a man talking when the imam was delivering the khutbah on Friday, so he threw a pebble at him, and when the man looked at him, he put his hand over his mouth. Narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah (5324) and via him by Ibn al-Mundhir in al-Awsat (4/78). It was classed as sahih by the commentator Shaykh Sa‘d ash-Shatri.\nSee: Ma sahha min Athar as-Sahabah fi’l-Fiqh (1/477).\nWhen Ibn ‘Umar did is not included in the prohibition on touching the pebbles, because if it is permissible to alert someone by means of a gesture, that should also apply to using pebbles, even though it is not what is most appropriate, and it is not what people usually do, as Imam Malik said.\nIbn al-Mulaqqin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It was narrated from Malik that people may be told to be quiet by saying ‘Subhan Allah’ or by gestures, but not by throwing pebbles, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever touches the pebbles has engaged in an idle action.” Ibn ‘Umar threw a pebble, but this is not the option to choose. Ibn al-Mundhir also narrated from Malik: There is nothing wrong with a gesture.""(At-Tawdih li Sharh al-Jami‘ as-Sahih\xa07/607).\nPerhaps Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) only did that to get the man’s attention as the man was not near him or facing him, such that he would see his gesture.

170654,"Is working as a doctor in the insurance department of a private hospital, in which my role is limited to sending medical reports on the patient who needs tests or surgery to the insurance department to get approval from the insurance company to go ahead with these procedures, permissible or prohibited? I hope that you can explain.","['Praise be to Allah.Is commercial insurance prohibited?\nCommercial insurance of all types is prohibited, whether it is life insurance, health insurance or insurance of one’s property. But it is permissible to deal with it in two cases:\xa0\n\nWhen a person is forced to do so , such as if he is forced to take out insurance on his car or a company forces its employees to take out health insurance. In that case the sin is on the one who forces people to do that.\nWhen a person is compelled to take out health insurance or he is in great need of it because he is not able to cover the cost of treatment from his pocket without having insurance. This is a need which makes it permissible to deal with health insurance according to a number of scholars, because the reason for the prohibition on this insurance is the ambiguity and the element of gambling, not Riba. When it is like that, it is permissible in the case of need.\n\nThe nature of the ambiguity is that the individual pays money but does not know whether his benefiting from medical services will be equal to that or more or less.\xa0\nSome types of insurance are based on both ambiguity and Riba, such as life insurance, where the individual pays installments and does not know how many they will be, in return for a known sum of money that is more than he paid.\xa0\nAmong those who are of the view that health insurance is permissible in the case of need are: Dr. ‘Ali Muhiy Ad-Din Al-Qurrah Daghi, Dr. ‘Abd Ar-Rahman ibn Salih Al-Atran, Dr. Yusuf Ash-Shubayli and Dr. Khalid Ad-Du`ayji.\xa0\nAmong the statements of the scholars that what is forbidden because of ambiguity is permissible in cases of need are the words of Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him):\xa0\n“The same applies to ambiguous transactions, which are a kind of gambling, but some types may be permissible in the case of need and where it serves a clear interest.” (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 14/471)\xa0\nAnd he (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Ambiguous transactions are forbidden because they are a kind of gambling which may lead to consuming people’s wealth unlawfully. But if that is countered by a greater harm, that makes it permissible so as to ward off the greater of two evils by putting up with the lesser. And Allah knows best.” (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 29/483)\xa0\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) also said:\n“The evils caused by ambiguous transactions are less than those caused by Riba, therefore a concession is granted when there is a need, if the prohibition on ambiguous transactions may cause greater harm than the transaction itself. Examples include sales of property, even if you do not know what is inside the walls or foundations, and sales of pregnant or suckling animals, even if you do not know the size of the embryo or the amount of milk, and even though it is forbidden to sell what is in the uterus on its own or the milk on its own (separate from the animal), according to most scholars. Another example is selling crops after it is clear that they are going to be good (although there cannot be absolute certainty), which is permissible according to the Sunnah. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) allowed the buyer of date palms that had been pollinated to stipulate that they should bear fruit, so he bought crops before there was any sign that they would be good, but that was on the basis of buying the origin (i.e., the trees). Thus it becomes clear that in cases of mild ambiguity (when the ambiguity pertains to that which is secondary to the original item) it is permitted to do what is not permitted in other cases.” (Al-Fatawa Al-Kubra, 4/21)\xa0\nCan you work as a doctor in the insurance department of the hospital?\xa0\nWhat seems to be the case is that it is permissible to work as a doctor in the insurance department of the hospital and that is not regarded as helping in something prohibited, because among the patients there are those who need this insurance or are compelled to take it out, or the company for which they work was forced to take out insurance on them and their families. In these cases it is permissible for people to benefit from health insurance as stated above. There will still be some who do not need it, but it is difficult to tell them apart and we ask Allah to forgive them.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/170654/is-health-insurance-prohibited-in-islam

So if it is for one month, it is binding until the end of the month. If it is for one or two years, the employee should stay until the end of the stipulated period; the worker has no right to leave the job before that and the boss has no right to sack him before the end of that period. If the boss sacked him, he must give him his wages until the end of the contract period. There are two exceptions to that:\n1.\nIf the contract allows the employee to leave the job if he gives notice as stipulated, such as three months’ notice. In that case there is nothing wrong with the employee leaving the job before the end of his contract and without the consent of the company, if he gives sufficient notice to his company that he is resigning.\nThe same applies if the contract allows the boss to dismiss him.\nIn this case, the required notice period is what is mentioned in the contract, such as three months.\n2.\nCancellation of the contract due to some unforeseen emergency, such as if the shop or factory is closed down, or if the worker has to leave the country.\nPlease see the answer to question no. 334215 .\nSecondly:\nIf the employee leaves the job during the month, he is only entitled to payment for the days he worked.\nIt says in Durar al-Hukkam Sharh Majallat al-Ahkam (1/4589): As for the employee who works for part of the period, he is entitled to wages as appropriate to this period. (See clause no. 470).\nFor example: if he is employed by someone else to work for one year for certain wages, then he works for him for six months, after which he leaves the job and travels to another country, then he returns after the end of the year and asks his former boss for payment for the six months for which he worked, hee is entitled to that, and the employer has no right to withhold it from him on the grounds that he did not complete the period for which he hired him.

182508,"I know that all seafood is halal, but someone said that it is not permissible to eat whales (al-hut), because they give birth to live young and do not lay eggs, unlike other fish. He quoted as evidence for that the fact that seals, turtles and elephant seals, et cetera, are not permissible to eat, because they give birth to live young and do not lay eggs. Is it true that it is not permissible to eat these animals? Is there anything in the Qur’an or sahih Sunnah that refers specifically to this issue? Another question: how can we tell whether a particular sea creature is halal or haram? The shark, for example, lives in the sea, meaning that it is halal in that regard, but it is a predator that kills and eats other animals, so it becomes haram in that regard, because it is not permissible to eat animals that kill and eat others. I hope that you can explain.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nWe have noted previously that all sea creatures that only live in the water are halal, whether they are caught alive or they are found dead (maytah, “dead meat”), because of the general meaning of the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Lawful to you is game from the sea and its food}\xa0[al-Ma’idah 5:96].\nAbu Dawud (83) narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said about the sea: “Its water is a means of purification and its animals that are found dead are permissible.” Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud.\nThe scholars of the Standing Committee said: The basic principle regarding sea creatures that usually only live in the water is that they are halal.""(Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Da’imah\xa0 22 /312).\nThe guideline regarding sea creatures is that it is not haram to eat any of them if they only live in the water.\nAs for amphibious animals [those that live both in the water and on land], they are not all halal.\nSecondly:\nEating al-hut [large fish; sometimes translated as whale] is permissible, because they are a type of fish.\nIt says in Lisan al-‘Arab [a famous Arabic-language dictionary] (2/26):\nAl-hut means fish, and it was said that it refers to large fish. End quote.\nIbn Majah (3218) narrated from ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Two types of ‘dead meat’ have been made permissible for us: fish and locusts.” Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah.\nAnd we have noted above that all sea creatures are halal.\nIn Sahih al-Bukhari (4362) and Sahih Muslim (1935) it is narrated that Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) said: We went out on campaign with the ‘army of the leaves’ [so called because they were so hungry that they ate leaves from trees], and Abu ‘Ubaydah was appointed as our commander. We were stricken with severe hunger, then the sea threw out a dead fish, the like of which we had never seen, which was called al-‘anbar (sperm whale) and we ate from it for half a month. Abu ‘Ubaydah took one of its bones and a rider passed under it. Abu’z-Zubayr told me that he heard Jabir say: Abu ‘Ubaydah said: Eat. When we came to Madinah, we told the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) about that, and he said: “Eat, for it is provision that Allah has given you, and give us some, if you have any of it with you.” So some of them gave him [some of that fish] and he ate it.\nAs for the fact that it gives birth to live young and does not lay eggs, that has nothing to do with the shar‘i ruling and does not affect it. There is nothing in the religious text to suggest that sea creatures that give birth to live young and do not lay eggs are haram and cannot be eaten; rather the general meaning of the evidence indicates that they are all halal. This is quite clear, and there is no argument about it.\nThirdly:\nSharks are halal, because of what is mentioned above and because of the general meaning of the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “Two kinds of ‘dead meat’ and two kinds of blood have been permitted to you. The two kinds of ‘dead meat’ are fish and locusts, and the two kinds of blood are the liver and spleen.” \xa0Narrated by Ibn Majah (3314); classed as sahih by al-Albani.\nThe fact that the shark is a predator does not cancel that. The prohibition on every predator that has fangs applies only to land animals that are predators. As for the predators of the sea, this ruling does not apply to them.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIt cannot be said that for whatever land animal is haram, its counterpart in the sea is also haram, because the sea is something separate, even though there are animals in it which have fangs with which they attack other animals, such as sharks… The point is that there are animals [in the sea] that kill and eat others, yet despite that they are halal.

50070,What are the virtues of Qiyam Al-Layl?,"[""Praise be to Allah.Qiyam Al-Layl is a confirmed Sunnah. Many texts of the Quran and Sunnah encourage it and speak of its high status and great reward.\xa0\nQiyam Al-Layl plays a great role in strengthening one's faith and helping one to do good deeds. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“O you wrapped in garments (i.e. Prophet Muhammad)! Stand (to pray) all night, except a little — Half of it or a little less than that, Or a little more. And recite the Quran (aloud) in a slow, (pleasant tone and) style. Verily, We shall send down to you a weighty Word (i.e. obligations, laws). Verily, the rising by night (for Tahajjud prayer ) is very hard and most potent and good for governing oneself, and most suitable for (understanding) the Word (of Allah).”\xa0[Al-Muzzamil 73:1-6]\nAllah praises those who have faith and are pious for their noble characteristics and good deeds, one of the most special of which is Qiyam Al-Layl. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Only those believe in Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), who, when they are reminded of them, fall down prostrate, and glorify the Praises of their Lord, and they are not proud. Their sides forsake their beds, to invoke their Lord in fear and hope, and they spend (in charity in Allah’s Cause) out of what We have bestowed on them. No person knows what is kept hidden for them of joy as a reward for what they used to do.”\xa0[As-Sajdah 32:15-17]\nAllah describes them elsewhere in the following terms (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And those who spend the night in worship of their Lord, prostrating and standing. And those who say: “Our Lord! Avert from us the torment of Hell. Verily, its torment is ever an inseparable, permanent punishment.” Evil indeed it (Hell) is as an abode and as a place to rest in. And those who, when they spend, are neither extravagant nor niggardly, but hold a medium (way) between those (extremes). And those who do not invoke any other god along with Allah, nor kill the soul which Allah has forbidden [to be killed], except by right, nor commit illegal sexual intercourse and whoever does this shall receive the punishment.\xa0 The torment will be doubled to him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein in disgrace; Except those who repent and believe (in Islamic Monotheism), and do righteous deeds; for those, Allah will change their sins into good deeds, and Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. And whosoever repents and does righteous good deeds; then verily, he repents towards Allah with true repentance. And those who do not bear witness to falsehood, and if they pass by some evil play or evil talk, they pass by it with dignity. And those who, when they are reminded of the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of their Lord, fall not deaf and blind thereat. And those who say: “Our Lord! Bestow on us from our wives and our offspring the comfort of our eyes, and make us leaders of the Muttaqun (the pious).” Those will be rewarded with the highest place (in Paradise) because of their patience. Therein they shall be met with greetings and the word of peace and respect. Abiding therein excellent it is as an abode, and as a place to rest in.”\xa0[Al-Furqan 25:64-76]\nFrom this we may note the virtue of Qiyam Al-Layl and its good consequences that cannot be ignored; it is one of the means of avoiding the punishment of Hell and attaining Paradise, and we may note the great blessing it brings of conversing with the Lord. May Allah make us among those who attain success thereby.\xa0\nAllah has described the pious in Surah Adh-Dhariyat as having a number of characteristics – including praying Qiyam Al-Layl – by means of which they attain Paradise. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Verily, the pious will be in the midst of Gardens and Springs (in the Paradise), Taking joy in the things which their Lord has given them. Verily, they were before this, good-doers. They used to sleep but little by night [invoking their Lord (Allah) and praying, with fear and hope]”\xa0[Adh-Dhariyat 51:15-17]\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) encouraged us to pray Qiyam Al-Layl in many Hadiths, such as the following:\xa0\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The best prayer after the obligatory prayer is prayer at night.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1163)\xa0\nHe (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) also said: “You should pray Qiyam Al-Layl , for it is the custom of the righteous who came before you and it brings you closer to your Lord, and expiates sins and prevents misdeeds.”\xa0(Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 3549; classed as sound by Al-Albani in Irwa’ Al-Ghalil, 452)\xa0\n“The custom of the righteous” means it was their usual practise.\xa0\n“It brings you closer to your Lord” means, it is an act of worship by means of which one may draw closer to Allah.\xa0\n“and prevents misdeeds” means, it prevents one from committing sin. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Verily, the prayer prevents from great sins (of every kind, and from unlawful sexual intercourse) and Al-Munkar (i.e. disbelief, polytheism, and every kind of evil wicked deed).”\xa0[Al-`Ankabut 29:45]\n`Amr ibn Murrah Al-Juhani (may Allah be pleased with him) said: A man came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) from Qada’ah and said to him: “O Messenger of Allah, what do you think if I bear witness that there is none is worthy of worship except Allah and that you are His Messenger, and I pray the five daily prayers, and fast the month (of Ramadan), and pray Qiyam in Ramadan, and pay Zakah?”\xa0 The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever dies doing that will be one of the Siddiqs and martyrs.” (Narrated by Ibn Khuzaymah; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Khuzaymah, 2212)\nAt-Tirmidhi (1984) narrated that `Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “In Paradise there are apartments the outside of which can be seen from the inside and the inside of which can be seen from the outside.” A Bedouin stood up and said: “Who are they for, O Messenger of Allah?” He said: “They are for those who speak good words, feed others, fast regularly and pray to Allah at night when people are sleeping.” (Classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Tirmidhi)\xa0\nAl-Hakim (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Jibril came to me and said: `O Muhammad, live as long as you want, for you will die. Love whomever you want, for you will leave him. Do whatever you want for you will be requited for it. Remember that the believer’s honour is his praying at night, and his pride is his being independent of people.” (Classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih Al-Jami`, 73) \xa0\nThe Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever prays Qiyam reciting ten verses will not be recorded as one of the negligent. Whoever prays Qiyam reciting one hundred verses will be recorded as one of the devout. Whoever prays Qiyam reciting one thousand verses will be recorded as one of the Muqantirin.”\xa0(Narrated by Abu Dawud, 1398; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud)\xa0\nThe Muqantirin are those who will be given a Qintar of reward. A Qintar is a large amount of gold, and most of the scholars of Arabic language are of the view that it is four thousand Dinars.\xa0\nIt was also said that a Qintar is a bull’s hide full of gold, or eighty thousand, or a large but unspecified amount of wealth. (See Al-Nihayah fi Gharib il-Hadith by Ibn Al-Athir)\nWhat is meant by this Hadith is to emphasize the greatness of the reward earned by the one who recites a thousand verses. At-Tabarani narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “A Qintar is better than this world and everything in it.” (Classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Targhib, 638)\xa0\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: From Surah Tabarak [Al-Mulk] to the end of the Quran is one thousand verses.\xa0\nWhoever prays Qiyam reciting from Surah Tabarak to the end of Quran has prayed Qiyam with one thousand verses.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/50070/virtues-of-qiyam-al-layl
471601,"We know that abortion of the foetus before forty days is permissible, if there is a medical reason or there is a risk to the mother from being pregnant. But how are the forty days counted? Is it from the time of ovulation or from the time of the last menstrual period?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nWe emphasise that we should not be lenient at all with regard to abortion in the first forty days, unless the conditions are met which have been affirmed by fiqh councils, senior scholars and fatwa committees. That has previously been discussed in detail on our website. Please see questions no. 115954 and 171943 .\nSecondly:\nWe asked Dr. Muhammad ‘Ali al-Barr (may Allah preserve him), a consultant of internal medicine and a consultant in the Islamic Medicine Department at the King Fahd Centre for Medical Research at King ‘Abdul ‘Aziz University, and a medical expert in fiqh councils about this matter, and he replied:\nAccording to doctors, the calculation of pregnancy begins from the first day of the last menstrual period before pregnancy occurred. This is used as a standard to count the weeks of pregnancy, which are forty weeks. But the age of the foetus begins from approximately two weeks, between 13-15 days, after the end of this menstrual period. This is the time when ovulation takes place, which occurs after the end of menses, and that only happens once after the monthly period has ended, and after that the [fertilized] egg settles in the uterus within only 12-24 hours, which is when pregnancy begins. So the real age of the foetus begins 14 days after the end of the previous menstrual cycle. This is what is the case for most women. End quote. (Recorded answer).\nBased on that, working out the age of the foetus begins fourteen days after the end of the menstrual cycle that preceded the pregnancy, which is the time of ovulation.\nThis is the basis on which the counting of forty days, and when the soul is breathed into the foetus are worked out, and it is used to determine the ruling on bleeding that occurs after miscarriage, if it occurs before or after eighty days.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/471601/how-is-the-age-of-the-foetus-worked-out
12804,"The Islamic life is the best life that a person could live, but sometimes things get so difficult that I feel that I have no hope of carrying on.","['Praise be to Allah.Understanding the essence of Islamic life\nYou have done well by realising that the Islamic life is the best life that a person could live. This is a great truth which few people understand, let alone become convinced of. Allah has stated that in more than one place in his Book.\xa0\nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Whoever works righteousness — whether male or female — while he (or she) is a true believer (of Islamic Monotheism) verily, to him We will give a good life (in this world with respect, contentment and lawful provision), and We shall pay them certainly a reward in proportion to the best of what they used to do (i.e. Paradise in the Hereafter).”\xa0[An-Nahl 16:97]\nAnd Allah has stated that whoever turns away from faith in Allah and remembrance of Him exposes himself to a life of hardship and misery , as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“But whosoever turns away from My Reminder (i.e. neither believes in this Quran nor acts on its teachings) verily, for him is a life of hardship, and We shall raise him up blind on the Day of Resurrection.”\nHe will say: ‘O my Lord! Why have you raised me up blind, while I had sight (before).’\n\xa0(Allah) will say: ‘Like this: Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) came unto you, but you disregarded them (i.e. you left them, did not think deeply in them, and you turned away from them), and so this Day, you will be neglected (in the Hell-fire, away from Allah’s Mercy).’\nAnd thus do We requite him who transgresses beyond bounds [i.e. commits the great sins and disobeys his Lord (Allah) and believes not in His Messengers, and His revealed Books, like this Quran], and believes not in the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of his Lord; and the torment of the Hereafter is far more severe and more lasting.”\xa0[Ta-Ha 20:124-127]\nIslamic life requires patience and forbearance\nOnce you have understood this, and it has become deeply rooted in your heart and you are at peace with it, then you will know that Allah has not created this universe, with the earth and the heavens, the seas and the rivers, the mountains and plains, the oases and the deserts, except for your sake, O poor, weak creature. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“He is Who created for you all that is on earth.”\xa0[Al-Baqarah 2:29]\nThen you will realise that the great purpose for which you exist in this world is to worship your Lord and Creator, Who has created all things well:\xa0\n“And I (Allah) created not the jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me (Alone).” [Adh-Dhariyat 51:56 – interpretation of the meaning]\nHe has only created life and death in order to test His slaves in their performance of this duty of worship:\xa0\n“Who has created death and life that He may test you which of you is best in deed.\xa0 And He is the All-Mighty, the Oft-Forgiving”\xa0[Al-Mulk 67:2 – interpretation of the meaning]\nThen Allah honoured His slaves and promised those who do good in this world that in the Hereafter theirs will be Paradise as vast as the heavens and the earth, in which is that which no eye has ever seen, no ear has ever heard, nor has it ever entered the mind of man. By the same token, He has warned those who do evil and neglect His rights over them that theirs will be a blazing Fire, in which they will neither live nor die, in which He has created all kinds of punishments and torments, hearing of which would turn a child’s hair white, let alone seeing them and suffering them. We ask Allah to keep us and you safe from that… amen.\xa0\nOnce you know this with certainty, then you will know that succeeding in this test is a serious matter which can only be achieved with a measure of effort and hardship which requires patience and forbearance . But this is hardship which passes swiftly and difficulty which soon comes to an end, because it is followed by eternal rest and happiness. So what is an hour of hardship and a moment of pain when compared to that eternal delight. We ask Allah to bless us and you with His grace and Paradise…amen.\xa0\nIslam started as something strange\xa0\nYou should also note – may Allah guide you – that the more religious commitment becomes something strange and the fewer people there are who truly adhere to it – as is the situation nowadays – the more difficult it becomes to remain steadfast. It is hard to be different from the vast majority of people. Hence Allah in His wisdom increases the reward of the sincere believers who remain steadfast in adhering to the truth, those who give precedence to pleasing Him over everything else and sacrifice that which is most precious to them for the sake of achieving that. Muslim (145) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Islam started as something strange and will go back to being something strange as it began. So glad tidings to the strangers.”\xa0\nIn Sunan At-Tirmidhi (3058), it is narrated from Abu Tha`labah Al-Khushani (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “After you there will come days during which being patient will be like holding on to a live coal. The one who strives during those days will have a reward like that of fifty men who strive as you do.” According to another report: It was said: “O Messenger of Allah, the reward of fifty men like them or like us?” He said: “No, the reward of fifty men like you.” (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Targhib wat Tarhib, 3172)\xa0\nThese Hadiths and others indicate that at the end of time, there will be many evil and corrupt people, and few who are good and righteous and fear Allah. That is because there will be so much Fitnah (temptation and tribulation) and because sin and temptation will be so widespread that adhering to Islam will become something strange and may even become something strange among the Muslims themselves.\xa0\nThese Hadiths also indicate that adherence to Islam is not something easy, rather it is like holding on to a live coal. What will help a person to do that, after guidance from Allah, is being patient in adhering to this path until he meets his Lord not being negligent or heedless, so he will meet a Lord Who is pleased with him and not angry with him, and will give him a great and much-multiplied reward. If a person truly understands this, he will regard as insignificant whatever he encounters for the sake of that which is waiting for him with his Lord, by the will and grace of Allah.\xa0\nWhat we have said applies if you feel that things are too difficult for you and you fear that your patience is weak and that you are slipping and not remaining steadfast.\xa0\nBeware of letting despair enter your heart\nHowever, if you are feeling that you have no hope of spreading this Islamic life that you live among those who are around you, and bringing them back to Islam as you are obliged to do, because of the opposition and resistance that you encounter, you should know that every step that you take in that direction is a victory and an act of charity. A good word is a charity, and you do not know when a word that you have spoken may take effect in the heart of the one who hears it and be of some benefit to him, even if that is after some time. So you should not give up hope that it will do some good one day.\xa0\n“And when a community among them said: “Why do you preach to a people whom Allah is about to destroy or to punish with a severe torment?” (The preachers) said: “In order to be free from guilt before your Lord (Allah), and perhaps they may fear Allah.” [Al-A`raf 7:164 - interpretation of the meaning]\nBeware of letting despair enter your heart. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Certainly no one despairs of Allah’s Mercy, except the people who disbelieve.” [Yusuf 12:87]\nBeware of despair for it is misguidance:\xa0\n“And who despairs of the Mercy of his Lord except those who are astray?” [Al-Hijr 15:56 - interpretation of the meaning]\nRemember that your efforts will never be lost, so long as you remain on the right path. The point where your life ends, this is your destination:\xa0\n“He who emigrates (from his home) in the Cause of Allah, will find on earth many dwelling places and plenty to live by. And whosoever leaves his home as an emigrant unto Allah and His Messenger, and death overtakes him, his reward is then surely, incumbent upon Allah. And Allah is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” [An-Nisa’ 4:100 - interpretation of the meaning]\nThen will come the turn of those who come after you, to take the flag from you and continue the rest of the journey. How many of this Ummah are still left: “Allah will continue to plant new people in this religion and use them in His obedience.” (Narrated by Ibn Majah and classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sunan Ibn Majah, 1/5)\xa0\nBe certain of the promise of Allah to this Ummah of support and help\xa0\n“And indeed We have written in Az-Zaboor [i.e. all the revealed Holy Books the Tawrat (Torah), the Injil (Gospel), the Psalms, the Quran] after (We have already written in) Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuth (the Book that is in the heaven with Allah) that My righteous slaves shall inherit the land (i.e. the land of Paradise).” [Al-Anbiya’ 21:105 - interpretation of the meaning]\n“This matter (i.e., Islam) will reach as far as the day and night reach, and Allah will not leave any house of mud or hair but He will bring this religion into it … and Allah will bring glory to Islam and humiliation to kufr.” (Narrated by Ahmad and classed as authentic by Al-Albani in As-Silsilah As-Sahihah, 32)\xa0\nI urge you to remain steadfast in your religious commitment and not to turn away from it despite the many trials and temptations and the many obstacles. Remember that the good end will be for those who fear Allah (the pious).\xa0\nYou should strive to find all means that will help you to remain steadfast in adhering to the religion of Allah. On this website you will find an essay which describes ways and means of remaining steadfast in Islam. I advise you to read it and study it.\xa0\nVerses which encourage steadfastness in faith\nIn conclusion, I would like to leave you with these great verses from the Book of Allah which He revealed to His slave Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to be a healing for the believers’ hearts and a remedy for their ills. Read them and ponder them, and if you can look up the commentary on them in one of the books of Tafsir such as the Tafsir of Shaykh `Abd Ar-Rahman ibn Sa`di or Tafsir Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) then that will be good.\xa0\nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Or do you think that you will enter Paradise without such (trials) as came to those who passed away before you? They were afflicted with severe poverty and ailments and were so shaken that even the Messenger and those who believed along with him said, ‘When (will come) the Help of Allah?’ Yes! Certainly, the Help of Allah is near!”\xa0[Al-Baqarah 2:214]\n“Alif-Lam-Mim.\n[These letters are one of the miracles of the Quran, and none but Allah (Alone) knows their meanings.]\nDo people think that they will be left alone because they say: “We believe,” and will not be tested.\nAnd We indeed tested those who were before them. And Allah will certainly make (it) known (the truth of) those who are true, and will certainly make (it) known (the falsehood of) those who are liars, (although Allah knows all that before putting them to test)” [Al-`Ankabut 29:1-3]\n“And for those who believe (in the Oneness of Allah and the other articles of Faith) and do righteous good deeds, surely, We shall make them enter with (in the entrance of) the righteous (in Paradise).\nOf mankind are some who say: ‘We believe in Allah.’ But if they are made to suffer for the sake of Allah, they consider the trial of mankind as Allah’s punishment; and if victory comes from your Lord, (the hypocrites) will say: ‘Verily, we were with you (helping you).’ Is not Allah Best Aware of what is in the breasts of the ‘Alamin (mankind and jinn).”\xa0[Al-`Ankabut 29:9-10]\xa0\n“And among mankind is he who worships Allah as it were upon the edge (i.e. in doubt): if good befalls him, he is content therewith; but if a trial befalls him he turns back on his face (i.e. reverts to disbelief after embracing Islam). He loses both this world and the Hereafter. That is the evident loss.”\xa0[Al-Hajj 22:11]\xa0\n“Verily, those who say: ‘Our Lord is Allah (Alone),’ and then they stand firm, on them the angels will descend (at the time of their death) (saying): ‘Fear not, nor grieve! But receive the glad tidings of Paradise which you have been promised!’”\xa0[Fussilat 41:30]\xa0\n“Verily, those who say: ‘Our Lord is (only) Allah,’ and thereafter stand firm (on the Islamic Faith of Monotheism), on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.\nSuch shall be the dwellers of Paradise, abiding therein (forever) a reward for what they used to do.” [Al-Ahqaf 46:13-14]\nAnd there are other verses which encourage us to remain steadfast in our religious commitment and describe what Allah has promised to the sincere believers. The Book of Allah is filled with verses which state this and explain it in the most eloquent manner. So I advise you to read and ponder the Quran. By Allah’s Leave you will find in it the best help in remaining patient and not despairing or finding the way too long. For this world will quickly come to an end, then each person will find that which he has sent on ahead with his Lord; it is good, all well and good, but if it is bad then the outcome will be bad:\xa0\n“On the Day when every person will be confronted with all the good he has done, and all the evil he has done, he will wish that there were a great distance between him and his evil. And Allah warns you against Himself (His punishment) and Allah is full of kindness to (His) slaves.”\xa0[Al `Imran 3:30]\nI ask Allah to open your heart to goodness and to make you steadfast in adhering to the truth until You meet Him. May he divert all evil away from you, for He is All-Hearing, Ever Near. And Allah knows best.\xa0\nMay Allah send blessings and peace upon His slave and Prophet Muhammad and upon his family and companions.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12804/understanding-the-essence-of-islamic-life

Is it permissible for me to do this? If it is not permissible, what is an Islamically permissible way of doing that? Please note that the licence costs me money and there are stipulated conditions, and these licences are not given to anyone except citizens of my country.","['Praise be to Allah.What appears to be the case is that it is permissible to sell or rent trade licences, because such a licence has considerable monetary value, according to what is customary among traders, and obtaining it takes time, effort and money. This is in principle.\nBut if the rules and regulations do not allow that, then it is not permissible to sell or rent it, because of what that could lead to of disputes and arguments in which it is difficult to verify who is in the right and who in the wrong, in addition to what the licence holder may be subject to of punishments and penalties. If any penalty is imposed on the shop – for any reason – it will affect him, because the licence is in his name.\nShaykh Muhammad Taqiy al-‘Uthman said, in an essay about selling intangible rights: In the case of this licence [to buy and sell], in fact it is not something tangible; rather it is the right to import and export goods, so it is subject to the same rulings as tradenames, in the sense that this right is something affirmed for the one who has this licence, so it is permissible to pass it on in return for money. As obtaining this licence requires effort, time and money, and it gives the licence holder a legal description that is stated in a written certificate, according to which the trader is entitled to some facilities provided by the government to the licence holder, and this licence is regarded according to the customs of traders as being of great value, then in a way it is a kind of wealth. Therefore it is not far-fetched to suggest that it may be regarded as being like any tangible item that it is permissible to buy and sell. But all of that is sound and correct provided that the government has a law allowing transfer of the licence to someone else. But if the licence is in the name of a particular person or a particular company, and the law does not allow transfer of it to another person or another company, then there is no doubt that it is not permissible to sell it, because selling it could lead to lies and deceit, because the one who buys a licence will use it in the name of the seller, not in his own name.

What can I do?","['Praise be to Allah.Affection and compassion are aims of marriage in Islam\nOne of the greatest aims of marriage according to the laws of Allah is so that affection and compassion may prevail between the spouses . This is the foundation on which married life should be built. Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And among His Signs is this, that He created for you wives from among yourselves, that you may find repose in them, and He has put between you affection and mercy.”\xa0[Ar-Rum 30:21]\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Affection means love , and compassion means kindness . A man keeps a woman either because he loves her or because he feels compassion towards her because he has children from her.”\nHow to get husband to show affection\xa0\nOur advice to you is not to ignore the affection and compassion between spouses that Allah has mentioned in this verse. Think about the Mothers of the Believers, and the womenfolk of the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them all), especially the role of Khadijah (may Allah be pleased with her) with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Try to make your family happy and you will see the effect of that in sha Allah.\xa0\nOne of the greatest means of attaining happiness and cheerfulness is what was narrated from one of the righteous: “Kindness is something easy: a cheerful face and a gentle word. So try to adopt this kindness towards your husband – until it becomes ingrained in you – and you will win his heart and make him be affectionate and compassionate towards you.”\xa0\nBut before all that, and above all that, our Lord says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“The good deed and the evil deed cannot be equal. Repel (the evil) with one which is better (i.e. Allah orders the faithful believers to be patient at the time of anger, and to excuse those who treat them badly) then verily he, between whom and you there was enmity, (will become) as though he was a close friend. But none is granted it (the above quality) except those who are patient — and none is granted it except the owner of the great portion (of happiness in the Hereafter, i.e., Paradise and of a high moral character) in this world.”\xa0[Fussilat 41:34-35]\nShaykh Ibn Sa’di (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Good deeds and acts of obedience that are done for the sake of Allah cannot be equal to bad deeds and sins that earn His wrath and do not please Him. Kindness towards others cannot be equal to mistreatment of them. “Is there any reward for good other than good?” [Ar-Rahman 55:60 - interpretation of the meaning].”\xa0\nThen He enjoins a specific type of kindness which has a great impact, which is kindness towards the one who treats you badly. “Repel (the evil) with one which is better” i.e., if someone mistreats you, especially if he has great rights over you, such as relatives and friends and the like, and he mistreats you in word or in deed, then respond by treating him kindly. If he cuts off ties with you then uphold ties with him; if he wrongs you, forgive him; if he speaks against you, in your absence or in your presence, do not respond in kind, rather forgive him, and deal with him by speaking kindly; if he shuns you and does not speak to you, then speak nicely to him, and greet him with Salam. If you respond to mistreatment with kind treatment, that will do a great deal of good.\xa0\n“then verily he, between whom and you there was enmity, (will become) as though he was a close friend” i.e., as if he is close to you and a good\xa0 friend.\xa0\n“But none is granted it” i.e., this praiseworthy quality is not given to anyone “except those who are patient” and put up with what they dislike, and force themselves to do what Allah loves, for souls are created with a natural inclination to respond to bad treatment in kind and not to forgive it, so how can they respond in a good manner?\xa0\nIf a person is patient and obeys the command of his Lord, and understands the great reward, and knows that responding in kind to the one who mistreats him will not achieve anything and will only make the enmity worse, and that treating him kindly will not cause him any humiliation, rather it will raise him in status, because the one who shows humility for the sake of Allah, Allah will raise him in status thereby, then the matter will become easy for him and he will do that with joy and pleasure. \xa0\n“and none is granted it except the owner of the great portion” because this is a characteristic of the elite people, by means of which a person attains a high status in this world and in the Hereafter, which is one of the greatest and noblest of characteristics."" (Tafsir As-Sa’di, 549-550)\xa0\nIf all of this applies to the rights of people in general, then what about the rights of your husband? The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If I were to order anyone to prostrate to anyone else, I would have ordered women to prostrate to their husbands, because of the rights that Allah has given them over them.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 2140 and Atl-Tirmidhi, 1192; classed as authentic by Al-Albaani in As-Silsilah As-Sahihah, 1203)\xa0\nWe have started by speaking to you, because you are the one who asked the question, and we think that you are more likely to listen and respond to our advice. If that means giving up some of your rights and forgiving the one who has wronged you, then there is nothing wrong with that. Who can say that giving up some of one\'s rights or forgiving some mistreatment is shameful or a shortcoming? Rather it is perfection. \xa0\nMuslim narrated (2588) from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Charity does not decrease wealth. No one forgives, but Allah increases him in honour, and no one humbles himself before Allah but Allah raises him in status.”\xa0\nTips for a husband who does not care that his wife doesn’t feel well\nAs for speaking to your husband or rebuking him, it is words of sincere advice and a rebuke from those who love good for him and fear for the bad consequences that he may face as a result of his actions; they want to warn him against obeying satan and making him happy, and disobeying and incurring the wrath of the Most Merciful, may He be Exalted.\xa0\nAs for his obeying satan, Muslim narrated (2813) that Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: satan places his throne over the water, then he sends out his troops, and the one who is closest in status to him is the one who causes the greatest amount of Fitnah (tribulation or temptation). One of them comes and says, I have done such and such, and he says: You have not done anything. Then one of them comes and says: I did not leave him until I separated him and his wife. Then he draws him close to him and says: How good you are.” Al-A’mash said: I think he said: “and he embraces him.”” \xa0\nAs for his incurring the wrath of the Most Merciful and disobeying Him, let him listen to what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Fear Allah with regard to women, for you have taken them as a trust from Allah, and intimacy with them has become permissible to you by the word of Allah.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1218)\xa0\nIs this how you take a trust from Allah, O slave of Allah?!\xa0\nIs this how you deal with the word of Allah, O slave of Allah?!\xa0\nIs this how you respond to the advice of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), who said: “I urge you to treat women well” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 3331 and Muslim, 1468)\nAnd he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The best of you is the one who is best to his wife, and I am the best of you to my wives.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 3895 and Ibn Majah, 1977; classed as authentic by Al-Albaani in Sahih At-Tirmidhi)\xa0\nOr is this what living with them honourably means? Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “and live with them honourably” [An-Nisa’ 4:19].\xa0\nIs this what taking care of them means? The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Each of you is a shepherd and each of you is responsible for his flock. The ruler of the people is a shepherd and is responsible for his flock. A man is the shepherd of his household and is responsible for his flock. A woman is the shepherd of her husband’s house and children and is responsible for her flock. The slave is the shepherd of his master’s wealth and is responsible for it. Each of you is a shepherd and each of you is responsible for his flock.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari,\xa0 893, and Muslim, 1829)\xa0\nHave you not heard what the great Companion, `Aa’idh ibn `Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) said when he entered upon `Ubaydullah ibn Ziyad, the oppressive governor? The companion (may Allah be pleased with him) said to him: O my son, I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “The worst of guardians are those who are cruel. Beware lest you be one of them.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1830)\nAre you not afraid that you may be one of them?\xa0\nHave you never heard that everyone gets headaches sometimes? \xa0\nWe have never heard of anything stranger or weirder than this.\xa0\nOr perhaps you need some proof? Listen to this, O slave of Allah:\xa0\nIt was narrated that `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came back from Al-Baqi` and I had a headache and was saying, Oh my head. He said, “Rather, I should say, Oh my head, O `Aishah.” (Narrated by Ibn Majah, 1465; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Takhrij Al-Mishkat, 5970)\xa0\nYou should remember that when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) died, `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) was eighteen years old, which means that when she complained of this headache when she was younger than eighteen, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) believed her and treated her with compassion. `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) was asked: What did the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) do in his house? She said: He used to serve his family, then when the time for prayer came, he would go out to pray. (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 676)\xa0\nThis is evidence if you need it, but we do not think that you need evidence. Rather you need to act. The way is ahead of you but you are not moving.\xa0\nWe have spoken to you at length, but if a person does not benefit from a little then he will not benefit from a lot. \xa0\nYou should think that you may be afflicted one day and you will need this weak woman to support you and look after your affairs. Would you like her to treat you as you are treating her? \xa0\nOr would you like her to be better than you, and to believe you, although you did not believe her, and to support you, although you let her down, and to treat you kindly although you are treating her harshly, and to be forbearing towards you although you are treating her ignorantly.\xa0\nBy Allah, even the sweeter of the two is bitter.\xa0\nChoose for yourself the path of kindness. “Is there any reward for good other than good?” [Al-Rahman 55:60 - interpretation of the meaning]\nFor more details, please see the following category: Kind Treatment of Spouses\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/101130/how-to-get-the-husband-to-show-affection

In Sahih al-Bukhari (205), it is narrated that ‘Amr ibn Umayyah said: I saw the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) wiping over his turban and his khuffs.\nThe view that it is permissible to wipe over the turban is the view of Imam Ahmad.\nAs for the majority of jurists, they do not allow wiping over the turban.\nIbn Rushd said: The scholars differed with regard to wiping over the turban. Ahmad ibn Hanbal allowed that… And a number of them, including Malik, ash-Shafa‘i and Abu Hanifah, did not allow it.""(Bidayat al-Mujtahid\xa01/15).\nAn-Nawawi said: If he limits it to wiping over the turban and does not wipe any part of his head, that is not valid, and there is no difference of opinion among us regarding that. This is the view of most of the scholars.""(Al-Majmu‘\xa0 1/407).\nHence al-Mirdawi regarded the issue of wiping over the turban as one of the views that was unique to the Hanbali madhhab. See: al-Insaf 1/185.\nThe view of Imam Ahmad is the soundest view in terms of evidence.\nSecondly:\nThose who say that it is permissible to wipe over the turban do not differentiate between the turban and the khuffs in terms of the ruling on whether wudu is invalidated by taking them off or not. Rather the ruling in this regard is the same in both cases.\nThose who say that wudu is invalidated for the one who takes off the khuffs after wiping over them also say that with regard to the one who takes off his turban after wiping over it. This is the view of the Hanbalis.\nIbn Qudamah said regarding the turban: The ruling is the same with regard to the timescale, and he stipulated that one should already be in a state of purity when putting it on, and wudu is invalidated by taking off the turban [after wiping over it], as is the ruling with regard to the khuffs, because in both cases, wiping is done instead of doing something else.""(Al-Kafi\xa0 1/39).\nAl-Mirdawi said: If the foot or head of the one who wiped it becomes bare, or the timescale for wiping over them comes to an end, then the individual must purify himself in the normal way.""(Al-Insaf\xa0 1/190)\nThose who say that taking off the khuffs does not invalidate wudu also say the same with regard to taking off the turban. This is the view of Ibn Hazm az-Zahiri (the literalist), and was narrated from Imam Ahmad. It was also the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him). See: al-Muhalla (1/173, 1/340); al-Insaf by al-Mirdawi (1/190).\nShaykh al-Islam said: The wudu of one who wipes over his khuffs and turban is not invalidated by taking them off.""(Al-Ikhtiyarat al-‘Ilmiyyah, p. 26).\nWe have previously discussed the opinions of the scholars regarding the ruling on purification for one who takes off his khuffs, and which view is most likely to be correct, in the answers to questions no. 45788 and 26343 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/129557/is-the-ruling-on-taking-off-the-turban-after-wiping-over-it-in-wudu-the-same-as-the-ruling-regarding-the-khuffs
219679,"I have read many Fatwas on the topic of disposing of prohibited wealth after repentance, but it is not clear to me what the correct view is concerning this issue. Sometimes it is to be done by giving it in charity, sometimes by returning it to its owner, and sometimes there is a concession allowing one to make use of it. Is there a difference between one type of prohibited wealth and another, and what is the correct view concerning this?","['Praise be to Allah.Forms of prohibited money\nProhibited wealth may take various forms. It may be prohibited in and of itself or because of the manner in which it was acquired. That which is prohibited because of the manner in which it was acquired may have been taken with or without the consent of the owner, and the one who acquired it may have been aware of the prohibition, or he may have been ignorant of it, or he may have thought, on the basis of Ijtihad, that it was permissible (and then realised that it is not). Each situation has its own ruling.\xa0\nMoney that is prohibited in and of itself\xa0\nWhoever acquires wealth that is prohibited in and of itself , or something that Islam forbids people to buy and sell, keep or use in any way whatsoever, should not return it to its owner, and he should not keep it. Rather he must destroy it, and it is not permissible for him to make use of it by selling it, buying it, giving it away, keeping it or otherwise.\xa0\nWhat is meant by wealth that is prohibited in and of itself is any item that is prohibited in and of itself, such as alcohol, idols, pigs, and so on.\nMoney taken from another person in an unlawful manner\nWhoever takes the property of another person in an unlawful manner , without the owner’s consent or permission, such as stolen wealth, wealth that was seized by force, anything obtained fraudulently from the public wealth, anything taken by means of deceit and cheating, interest (Riba, usury) that a person was forced and compelled to pay, bribes that a person is compelled to pay in order to get what is rightfully his, and the like – all such wealth must be returned to its owner, and the responsibility of the one who took it unlawfully cannot be discharged otherwise.\xa0\nIf he has spent it or otherwise disposed of it, it remains a debt that he owes until he is able to repay it to its owner.\xa0\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“If the seized item was taken without the consent of its owner, and was not in exchange for something else, then he must return it to him. If it is not possible to return it to him, then it may be given to a third person to whom the one from whom it was taken owes money. If that is not possible, it must be repaid to his heirs. If that is not possible, then it may be given in charity on his behalf.\xa0\nIn that case, if the one to whom it rightfully belongs agrees to accept the reward for charity on the Day of Resurrection, then it will be his. But if he refuses, and insists on taking from the good deeds of the one who took it unlawfully, he will be recompensed in full commensurate with his wealth that was taken, and the reward for the charity will go to the one who gave it in charity, as is proven from the companions (may Allah be pleased with them)."" (Zad Al-Ma`ad, 5/690)\xa0\nProhibited money by means of a prohibited transaction\xa0\nWhoever acquires prohibited wealth by means of a prohibited transaction because he is ignorant of the prohibition on this transaction, or he believes it to be permissible on the basis of a Fatwa from a scholar whom he trusts, then in this case he is not required to do anything, on condition that he gives up this prohibited transaction when he learns of the prohibition on it, because Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“So whosoever receives an admonition from his Lord and stops taking Riba (usury) may keep his past gains.” \xa0[Al-Baqarah 2:275]\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“As for that concerning which there is no doubt in our view, it is that whatever he acquired on the basis of Ijtihad or ignorance, in this case he may keep his past gains, without a doubt, as is indicated by the Quran and Sunnah and rational thinking."" (Tafsir Ayat Ashkalat ‘ala Kathir min Al-`Ulama’,\xa0 2/592)\xa0\nAnd he (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“With regard to whatever wealth a man has acquired through transactions concerning which the Ummah differs, thinking that it was permissible for him to do that on the basis of Ijtihad or because he was following the view of a scholar, or he was following some people of knowledge, or because he was given a Fatwa to that effect by a scholar, and the like –\xa0\n… with regard to this wealth that they acquired and seized, they do not have to repay it. Even if it becomes clear to them after that, that they were mistaken in that regard, and that the one who gave them that fatwa was mistaken…\xa0\nWith regard to a Muslim who based his actions on Ijtihad and who believes that what he did of buying and selling, rentals and other transactions concerning which some of the scholars gave Fatwas, was permissible, if he received some money as a result of that, then it became clear to him later on that the correct view is that it is prohibited, that does not make prohibited what he had already received of money on the basis of Ijtihad that allowed him to do so."" (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 29/443)\xa0\nHe\xa0 (may Allah have mercy on him) also said:\xa0\n“Whoever does something, not knowing that it is forbidden, then he finds out that it is forbidden, is not to be punished. If he engages in a Riba-based transaction, believing it to be permissible, and he acquires wealth thereby, then an admonition comes to him from his Lord, he may keep his past gains."" (Tafsir Ayat Ashkalat ‘ala Kathir min Al-`Ulama’,\xa0 2/578)\xa0\nIn Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah li’l-Ifta it says:\xa0\n“With regard to the period during which you worked in the bank, we hope that Allah will forgive you for the sin thereof. With regard to what you accumulated of money and received in return for working in the bank in the past, there is no sin on you with regard to it, if you were unaware of the ruling on that.” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 15/46)\xa0\nShaykh Al-‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“If he did not know that this is prohibited, then he may keep what he received and he does not have to pay back anything; or if he followed a Fatwa from a scholar saying that it is not prohibited, then he does not have to repay anything. Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“So whosoever receives an admonition from his Lord and stops taking Riba (usury) may keep his past gains.” [Al-Baqarah 2:275]” (Al-Liqa’ Ash-Shahri, 67/19)\xa0\nProhibited money despite knowing that it is prohibited and taking it with the permission and consent of its owner\xa0\nWhoever acquires prohibited wealth despite knowing that it is prohibited, and takes it with the permission and consent of its owner, such as that which is taken on the basis of an invalid contract, wages for prohibited jobs , profits on trade in prohibited things, fees for prohibited services such as bearing false witness or writing down Riba (usury), or money that is taken as a bribe so that the one who pays it may obtain something that he is not rightfully entitled to, or money acquired by means of gambling, lotteries, soothsaying and the like, etc\xa0\nAll of this comes under the heading of wealth that is prohibited because of the manner in which it was acquired. It does not have to be paid back to its owner, according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions.\xa0\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“With regard to what was received of payment, if the payer gave it willingly, and he already got the prohibited thing that he paid the money for – such as one who paid money for alcohol or pork, or for unlawful sex or immoral actions – then the money does not have to be returned to the payer, because he paid it willingly and received the prohibited thing in return. It is not permissible for him to both take back the money and keep the thing he paid for, because that comes under the heading of helping him in sin and transgression, and making things easy for sinners.\xa0\nWhat more does the one who commits the immoral actions want, if he knows that he will get what he wants and his money will be returned to him? Islam is far above allowing such a thing, and it is not appropriate to suggest it.” (Zad Al-Ma`ad, 5/691)\xa0\nAccording to most of the scholars, he must get rid of this money by giving it in charity to the poor and needy, spending it on the common good, and the like. If he disposes of it in any way, it still remains a debt that he has to pay, and when he is able to do so, he must give it in charity.\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Whoever takes money for a particular item that is prohibited , or for a particular service that he did – such as wages for carrying alcohol, or payment to a cross-maker or to a prostitute, and the like – let him or her give it in charity, and repent from that prohibited deed, and the giving of that money in charity will be in expiation for what he or she did.\xa0\nThis payment is not permissible for him or her to benefit from personally, because it is an evil earning. At the same time, it is not to be given back to the one who paid it, because he has already got something in return for this money. And he or she should give it in charity, as was stated by the scholars, such as the statement by Imam Ahmad concerning the one who carries alcohol, and as was stated by the companions of Malik and others.” (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 22/142)\xa0\nIt says in Al-Ikhtiyar li Ta‘lil Al-Mukhtar (3/61):\xa0\n“Evil earnings: the way to dispose thereof is by giving them in charity.”\nIt says in Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah (14/32):\xa0\n“If the individual knew at the time of earning it that this income was prohibited , it does not become permissible for him by means of repentance; rather he must get rid of it by spending it on charitable causes.”\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“But if he was aware (that it was prohibited), he must dispose of the Riba by giving it in charity, so as to get rid of it, or by building mosques, repairing roads, and the like.” (Al-Liqa’ Ash-Shahri, 67/19)\xa0\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) favoured the view that if he is poor, then he may take from this money as much as he needs. He (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“The way to get rid of it and repent completely is by giving it in charity. But if he needs it, he may take as much as he needs, and give the rest in charity. This is the ruling on all earnings that are regarded as evil because of the manner in which they are earned, whether it was in return for a physical item or some service.”\xa0( Zad Al-Ma`ad, 5/691)\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) was inclined towards a different view, which is that he may make use of it and he is not obliged to give it in charity, so long as he has repented. He (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“But if he was aware of the prohibition, then the matter requires further discussion. It may be said: if we make the rule that he may keep past gains, that could be applicable to the one who earned money by selling alcohol knowing that it was prohibited, and therefore we could say that he may keep his past gains.\xa0\nSimilarly, if anyone earns prohibited money and repents, then it becomes permissible for him if the money was paid willingly, and that is also applicable to money earned by prostitutes and soothsayers.\xa0\nThis is not alien to the principles of Shari`ah, because the guidelines of Shari`ah differentiate between the one who repents and the one who does not repent, as in the verses in which Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“So whosoever receives an admonition from his Lord and stops taking Riba (usury) may keep his past gains.” [Al-Baqarah 2:275]\n“Say to those who have disbelieved, if they cease (from disbelief) their past will be forgiven.” [Al-Anfal 8:38]\nThis is further supported by the fact that this wealth is not to be destroyed, and there is no difference of opinion among the scholars concerning that. Rather it must either be given in charity, or given back to the fornicator or drinker from whom it was taken, even if he is persisting in his sin, or it is to be kept by the one who received it and has now repented.\xa0\nNo one would suggest that it be given back to the fornicator or drinker except one who does not understand what he is saying – although there are some jurists who say that – because it would lead to further mischief.\xa0\nAs for giving it in charity, this is a more appropriate option.\xa0\nBut it may be said that this person who has repented is more entitled to it than anyone else, and if he is poor, then he is undoubtedly more entitled to it than any other poor person. This is a Fatwa that I have given more than once: if the one who has repented is poor, he may take as much as he needs of it, for he is more entitled to it than anyone else, and it will help him in his repentance. But if he was obliged or required to give it away, that would cause him a great deal of harm, and he may decide not to repent as a result. Whoever reflects on the general guidelines of Islam will realise that people should be encouraged to repent by all possible means.\xa0\nMoreover, there is no mischief that will result if he keeps it, for he has already received the money and it is no longer the property of the one who paid it. It is not prohibited to own the money itself; rather it may be prohibited if it is a means of committing sin. But this person has already been forgiven by virtue of his repentance, so it is undoubtedly permissible for him to keep it if he is poor, but his keeping it even if he is well off may also be justifiable, because it is making repentance easier for the one who has acquired such wealth.\xa0\n\xa0Allah, may He be Glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“So whosoever receives an admonition from his Lord and stops taking Riba (usury) may keep his past gains; his case is for Allah (to judge).” [Al-Baqarah 2:275]\nIt does not say “whoever becomes Muslim”, or “whoever already knows that it is prohibited”. Rather Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “So whosoever receives an admonition from his Lord and stops”, and admonition is more applicable in the case of one who already knows of the prohibition than in the case of one who is not aware of it. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Allah admonishes you, that you may never repeat such (conduct), if you are (true) Believers.” [An-Noor 24:17]” (Tafsir Aayat Ashkalat ‘ala Kathir min Al-`Ulama’, 2/593-596)\xa0\nIn Musannaf Ibn Abu Shaybah (7/285) it says:\n“‘Abdullah ibn Numayr told us, from Ar-Rabi` ibn Sa`d, who said: A man asked Abu Ja`far about a man who said: A friend of mine acquired some prohibited wealth and it got mixed with everything that he and his family own. Then he realised the mistake he made, so he started doing Hajj and staying near the Ka`bah. What do you think he should do?\xa0\nHe said: I think he should fear Allah and not do it again.”\xa0\nShaykh ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan As-Sa‘di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Allah, may He be Exalted, did not enjoin returning what has already been acquired by means of Riba after repenting; rather He enjoined rejecting Riba that has not yet been acquired. That is because it was taken with the consent of its owner, so it is not like wealth that was seized by force.\xa0\nMoreover, this approach is making it easy and encouraging people to repent, unlike the view that makes the acceptability of repentance conditional upon returning what one had acquired in the past, no matter how great the amount or how difficult it may be to do that.” (Al-Fatawa As-Sa‘diyyah, p. 303)\xa0\nTo sum up the above:\n\nWith regard to prohibited things that Islam regards as being of no value, it is not permissible to gain any benefit from them at all; rather they must be disposed of by being destroyed.\n\n\nWith regard to wealth that was taken from its owner with no justification and without his permission or consent, it must be returned to him, or to his heirs if he has died, and one’s responsibility cannot be absolved otherwise. If it is not possible to reach him, then it may be given in charity on his behalf.\n\n\nWith regard to the person who acquired prohibited wealth but was unaware of the prohibition on this transaction, or he was following a scholar who issued a Fatwa to that effect, he does not have to get rid of this wealth after coming to know of the prohibition and repenting from that; rather he may make use of it.\n\n\nWith regard to the one who acquired prohibited wealth despite knowing of the prohibition, and he took it with the permission and consent of the owner, then he repented from that, he does not have to return it. However the scholars differed as to whether he is obliged to give it in charity or whether he may keep it and make use of it, as is the view favoured by Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah.\n\nWhat we advise is the following:\n\nIf this person who has repented is rich and is able to dispose of this wealth and is content to do so, then let him give it in charity to the poor, as is the view of the majority of scholars, and this is more likely to absolve his responsibility and is the more prudent approach.\n\n\nIf he is reluctant to do that, or that may prevent him from repenting and form an obstacle to his doing so, or if he is poor and needs the money, then he may make use of it, as is the view favoured by Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah.\n\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/219679/what-to-do-with-prohibited-money
470760,What is the opinion on holding a second congregation in all the madhabs?,"['Praise be to Allah.Holding a second congregational prayer in the mosque may happen in various ways; in some cases the ruling is agreed upon, and in others there is a difference of opinion on the ruling.\n-1-\nWhen a number of congregational prayers are held because the people are divided into different groups, sects and madhhabs, so the mosque management organises more than one congregational prayer on a permanent basis, with each group having its own imam and its own time for prayer.\nThis is not allowed, according to scholarly consensus.\nIt says in Mawahib al-Jalil by al-Hattab (may Allah have mercy on him):\nAs for establishing one prayer with two regular imams, where they both attend, and the one whose turn it is to pray first goes ahead and leads the prayer, whilst the other group sits and waits with their imam until the first group has finished, then they give the iqaamah for their prayer. No one has suggested that this is allowed, and it is not possible that there could be a report from any of the jurists to suggest that he did it or approved of it.\nIt is even worse if two imams are leading prayers at the same time, each of them saying “Hayya ‘ala as-salah (come to prayer)” and saying takbir, when those praying behind them are mixed, each of them hearing the recitation of the other? These people will cause more friction, that was not known to the early generations or those who came after them. Moreover, it is going against the words of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “Do not disturb one another with your recitation of Quran…”""(Mawahib al-Jalil\xa0 2/380).\n-2-\nWhen there is a second congregational prayer in a mosque in which there is no regular imam, as happens in some mosques that are on travel routes. In this case, it is permissible for there to be a number of congregational prayers, according to scholarly consensus.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: With regard to the views of the scholars regarding congregational prayer in a mosque where a congregational prayer has already been offered:\nIf there is no regular imam, then it is not disliked (makruh) for there to be a second, third or more congregational prayer, according to scholarly consensus.""(Al-Majmu‘\xa0 4/222).\n-3-\nHolding a second congregational prayer for some reason, in a mosque where there is a regular imam.\nThe majority of Hanafi, Maliki and Shafa‘i scholars are of the view that it is disliked (makruh) to hold a second congregational prayer in this case.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If there is a regular imam, and the mosque is not frequented, then in our view it is disliked (makruh) to hold a second congregational prayer without the permission of the imam. This is the view of ‘Uthman al-Batti, al-Awza‘i, Malik, al-Layth, ath-Thawri and Abu Hanifah.\nAhmad, Ishaq, Dawud and Ibn al-Mundhir said that it is not disliked (makruh).""(Al-Majmu‘\xa0 4/222).\nImam Abu Bakr ibn al-Mundhir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nChapter: The concession allowing prayer in congregation in a mosque in which the imam has already led the people in prayer.\nAbu Bakr said:\nWe have narrated that a man entered the mosque when the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) had already prayed, and he said: “Will anyone be charitable towards this man and pray with him?”\nThere was a difference of scholarly opinion regarding that.\nIt is proven from Anas that he led a congregational prayer after the imam had already prayed. It was also narrated from Ibn Mas‘ud that he did the same thing. This was the view of ‘Ata’, an-Nakha‘i, al-Hasan al-Basri, Qatadah, Ahmad and Ishaq. Ahmad quoted as evidence the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “Prayer in congregation is twenty-seven times better than prayer offered individually.”\nSome said: A congregational prayer should not be offered in the mosque twice. This is the view of Salim ibn ‘Abdillah, and also of Abu Qilabah, Ibn ‘Awn, Ayyub, ‘Uthman al-Batti, Malik, al-Layth ibn Sa‘d, Sufyan ath-Thawri, al-Awza‘i, ash-Shafa‘i, and ashab ar-ra’y.\nAbu Bakr ibn al-Mundhir said: I favour the first view.""(Al-Ishraf ‘ala Madhahib al-‘Ulama’\xa0 2/146-147).\nThis view which was favoured by Ibn al-Mundhir is the correct view, because of the evidence from the Sunnah to that effect.\nIbn al-Mundhir (may Allah have mercy on him) said elsewhere:\nIt is proven that the Prophet of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Prayer in congregation is twenty-seven times better than prayer offered individually.” And it is proven that he said: “For a man to pray with another man is more appropriate than his praying on his own, and for a man to pray with three others is more appropriate; the more people there are, the more beloved it is to Allah.”\nAnd the hadith of Abu Sa‘id [according to which a man came when the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) had already prayed, so he said: “Will anyone be charitable towards this man and pray with him?”] is proven.\nSo if some people miss the prayer with the imam, they may pray together in congregation, following the hadith of Abu Sa‘id, and seeking the virtue of praying in congregation. We do not know of any evidence for those who dislike and disallow that.""(Al-Awsat\xa0 4/248).\nSee also the answer to question no. 87847, in which there is a fatwa from Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin regarding this matter.\nBut to give a complete picture of this matter, we should mention the views of all the madhhabs.\nBadr ad-Deen al-‘Ayni al-Hanafi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIn our view, it is disliked (makruh) for the prayer in congregation to be repeated in the same mosque.""(Al-Binayah\xa0 2/580).\nYahya ibn Yahya al-Laythi said:\nMalik was asked about a mu’adhdhin who gives the call to prayer, then he waits to see whether anyone else will come, then no one comes, so he gives the iqamah (call immediately preceding the prayer) and prays by himself, then some people come after he has finished. Should he repeat the prayer with them? He said: He should not repeat the prayer. Whoever comes after he has finished praying, let him pray by himself.""(Muwatta’ Malik, narrated by Yahya\xa0 1/72).\nAsh-Shafa‘i (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf the mosque has a regular imam, and one or more men missed the prayer in the mosque, they should pray individually. I do not like them to pray in congregation, but if they do that, it is valid. However, I dislike them to do that, because that is not what the earlier generations did before us, and in fact some of them criticised that action.""(Al-Umm\xa02/292).\nPlease see also the answers to questions no. 87847 , 127293 and 146916 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/470760/what-is-the-ruling-on-doing-a-second-congregational-prayer-in-the-mosque-according-to-the-four-madhhabs
