406308,What's the ruling on applying Steroid (Triamcinolone Acetonide) ointment / paste within oral cavity for the treatment of Apthous Ulcer while fasting?,"['Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible for a fasting person to use steroid ointment to treat mouth ulcers while fasting; because the ointment (gel) dissolves in the mouth, mixes with saliva, and it is not possible to avoid swallowing it.\nThis ulcer does not cause difficulty that would allow for breaking the fast.\nAn-Nawawi said in ""Al-Majmu`"" (6/261): ""The person who is unable to fast because of a sickness which he hopes will go away is not obliged to fast. This applies if he encounters obvious difficulty in fasting and is not subject to the condition that he reaches a point when he is unable to fast. Rather our companions said: The permission not to fast is subject to the condition that fasting causes him difficulties that it is hard for him to bear.”\xa0\nFor further benefit, please see the answer to question number: (188934 ).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/406308/ruling-on-steroid-ointment-for-mouth-ulcers-while-fasting
499515,What is the ruling on a fasting person using a patch to remove the feeling of hunger and thirst? And does the ruling differ between someone who is unable to fast without it and someone who can?,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe patch for removing the sensation of hunger and thirst is a medical patch known as (diet patches) that is placed on the skin and consists of several chemical substances that work to remove the sensation of appetite and reduce the amount of water lost by the body, and is mostly used for the purpose of weight loss in dieting.\nSpecialists have mentioned that the basic and active substances of the typical medical patch consist of several substances, each with a role to play, and together these substances enable the patch to remove the sensation of hunger and thirst and reduce appetite (see: Al-Muftirat At-Tibbiyyah Al-Mu`asirah, p. 333-334).\nSecondly:\nThe majority of Jurists have opined that what enters the body through absorption by the skin pores does not break the fast of the person fasting, and they cited the Hadith of \'Aishah and Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with them): ""The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) would be overtaken by dawn in a state of janabah (major ritual impurity) from his family, then he would perform ghusl and fast,"" reported by Al-Bukhari (1825) and Muslim (1109). The point of evidence is that water penetrates the pores, and if it broke the fast, the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) would not have done it while fasting, and would have done it before dawn.\nThey also cited the report from Ibn Mas`ud in which he said: ""When it is a fasting day for one of you, let him wake up oiled and combed,"" reported by Al-Bukhari in a suspended form, Book of Fasting, Chapter on the ghusl of the fasting person.\nAnd they also cited the report of Abu Hurairah in which he said: ""When one of you is fasting, let him apply oil so that the effects of his fasting are not visible on him,"" reported by Ibn Abi Shaybah, (9755).\nAl-Zaila`i (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his discussion of what does not invalidate the fast: ""Or if he applied oil... he did not break the fast,"" ""Tabyin Al-Haqa\'iq Sharh Kanz Al-Daqa\'iq"" (1/322).\nThe members of the Fiqh Council unanimously agreed that ointments, creams, and medical patches do not break the fast. (See: Statement of the Islamic Fiqh Council, Journal of the Islamic Fiqh Council, Issue 10, Vol. 2, p. 454.)\nModern medicine has also established that there is no relationship between what enters through the pores of the head or otherwise and the digestive system, and what a person finds in terms of taste in his throat is from the taste buds and not due to the substance reaching the throat. (Journal of the Islamic Fiqh Council, previous reference, Vol. 2, p.262).\nThirdly:\nThe patch for removing the sensation of hunger and thirst does not break the fast, for the following reasons:\n1. What enters through the pores does not affect the validity of the fast as previously determined, and this is the reality of this patch.\n2. It is neither eating nor drinking, nor does it serve their purpose by nourishing the body.\n3. Intending not to feel hunger and thirst does not affect the validity of the fast, as it is proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) would cool himself with water while fasting to remove the sensation of fatigue. It is established in Abu Dawud: ""The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) would pour water over his head while fasting due to thirst or heat,"" reported by Abu Dawud (2365) and authenticated by Al-Albani.\nIt is also proven that the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) used to do that, as Al-Bukhari reported ""that Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) would wet a garment and place it on himself while fasting,"" reported by Al-Bukhari in a suspended form, Book of Fasting, Chapter on the ghusl of the fasting person.\nAnd Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) said: ""I had a small pool that I would plunge into while I was fasting."" Reported by Al-Bukhari in a suspended form, Book of Fasting, Chapter on the ghusl of the fasting person.\nIf the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) and the noble Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) intended to alleviate the burden of fasting, then the patch that removes the sensation of hunger and thirst is similar to this situation.\n4. The argument for prohibition due to its contradiction to wisdom is not accepted, as the objectives are derived purposes, and the rulings are not linked to them, but rather to the causes which are apparent and regulated characteristics. (See: Al-Muftirat At-Tibbiyyah Al-Mu`asirah, p. 333-338).\n5. In the decision of the Fiqh Council (No. 219) in its twenty-third session in Medina, during the period from 19-23 Safar 1440 AH, concluding the decision of the Council of the International Islamic Fiqh Academy No. 93(10/1) regarding nullifiers of the fast in the field of treatment.\nWhat does not invalidate the fast:\n4- The patch for removing the sensation of hunger.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/499515/ruling-on-appetite-suppressant-patches-while-fasting
93747,"If I enter the mosque late for `Isha’ prayer and I missed the `Isha’ prayer in congregation and I pray it on my own, and I am late in joining the Tarawih prayers because of doing `Isha’, and I miss two Rak`ahs of Tarawih, how should I do these two Rak`ahs? Alone or what?","['Praise be to Allah.Can you pray `Isha’ behind someone praying Tarawih?\nIf you miss `Isha’ and arrive when the Imam is praying Tarawih, it is better for you to join him with the intention of praying `Isha’ . When he says the Salam, you should complete your prayer and not pray alone or with another congregation, so that there will not be two congregations at the same time, which may lead to distraction due to the intermingling of voices.\xa0\nWhat to Do If You Miss Part of Tarawih?\nAs for what you have missed of Tarawih , if you wish you may do it, so you may pray two Rak`ahs when the Imam prays Witr, then pray what you missed, and then pray Witr. \xa0\nWhat is meant by praying two Rak`ahs when the Imam prays Witr is that you do not say Salam with him when he ends his Witr, rather you should stand up and pray another Rak`ah, then say the Salam.\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: If I join the people when they are praying Tarawih and I have missed part of it, should I make up what I have missed after Witr or what should I do?\xa0\nHe replied:\xa0\n“Do not make up what you have missed after Witr , rather if you want to make up what you have missed, then pray two Rak`ahs when the Imam prays Witr, then offer the prayers you missed, then pray Witr.\xa0\nHere there is an issue to which attention should be drawn: If you arrive when the Imam is praying Tarawih and you have not prayed `Isha’ yet, what should you do?\xa0 Should you pray `Isha’ on your own or join the Imam in Tarawih with the intention of praying `Isha’?\xa0\nThe answer is that you should join the Imam in Tarawih with the intention of praying `Isha’. When the Imam says Salam from Tarawih, then stand up and make up the rest of `Isha’. Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) mentioned the exact same issue, and this was also the view favoured by Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him), and this is the correct view, because the correct view is that it is permissible to offer an obligatory prayer in congregation behind an Imam who is offering an optional prayer , based on the evidence of the Hadith of Mu`adh ibn Jabal (may Allah be pleased with him) who said that he used to pray `Isha’ with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), then he would go back to his people and lead them in offering that prayer – it was optional for him and obligatory for them.” (Al-Liqa’ Ash-Shahri)\xa0\nIt is better for you to make it up in congregation if you can, but if that is not possible then there is nothing wrong with you making it up on your own.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/93747/what-to-do-if-you-miss-part-of-tarawih
