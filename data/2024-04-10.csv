273295,"Who inherits from a man who leaves behind no father, mother, wife or children, but he has nieces who are the daughters of a deceased full brother, and he has nephews and nieces who are the sons and daughters of deceased full sisters, and he has a paternal cousin, and his paternal uncle is also deceased. Is this a case of kalalah?","['Praise be to Allah.This case is a case of kalalah. What is meant by kalalah is when a man dies and does not leave behind parents or children who could inherit from him.""(An-Nihayah fi Gharib al-Hadith wa’l-Athar\xa0 4/197).\nPlease see the answer to question no. 185972 .\nAs there is no heir who would inherit an allocated share of the estate in this case, the entire estate goes to the paternal cousin, because he is the only ‘asib [male relative on the father’s side]. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Give the allocated shares of inheritance to those who are entitled to them, and whatever is left over goes to the closest male relative who has no allocated share.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (6732).\nThis paternal cousin is the closest male relative. As for the daughters of his brother, and the sons and daughters of his sisters, they do not inherit anything, because they come under the heading of dhawi’l-arham (relatives who do not receive any share of the inheritance). According to the view that they may inherit, they only inherit when there are no heirs who are entitled to allocated shares and no male relatives on the father’s side, and this condition is not met in this case, because of the presence of the male relative on the father’s side, namely the son of the paternal uncle.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/273295/if-someone-dies-and-leaves-behind-the-children-of-his-siblings-and-a-paternal-cousin-how-should-the-estate-be-divided
188229,"I want to start reciting the beautiful names of Allah every day, starting this Ramadan. What is the reward that will result from that? What are the best times to do this act of worship?","['Praise be to Allah.The Sunnah tells us that the reward for memorising the names of Allah, may He be Exalted, is admission to Paradise. Al-Bukhari (2736) and Muslim (2677) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has ninety-nine names . Whoever memorises them will enter Paradise.”\xa0\nThe word translated as memorised in this Hadith include the following:\xa0\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Memorising them\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Understanding their meanings\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Acting upon what they imply. So if a person knows that Allah is One, he will not associate anything else with Him; if he knows that He is the Provider, he will not seek provision from anyone else; if he knows that He is the Most Merciful, he will do acts of obedience that are a means of attaining this mercy… And so on\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Calling upon Him by these names, as Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And (all) the Most Beautiful Names belong to Allah , so call on Him by them” [Al-A`raf 7:180]. So one may say for example, “O Most Gracious, have mercy on me; O Oft-Forgiving, forgive me; O Accepter of repentance, accept my repentance” and so on. Thus you will realise that it is not prescribed to merely recite these names without understanding them, acting upon them and calling upon Allah by them.\xa0\nShaykh Muhammad ibn Salih Al-`Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “What is meant by memorising them is not merely writing them on a piece of paper, then repeating them until you have memorised them…” (Majmu` Fatawa wa Rasa’il Ibn `Uthaymin, 1/74)\xa0\nUndoubtedly focusing in Ramadan on reading the Quran is better than focusing on any other kind of Dhikr. We advise you to read a great deal of the Quran and ponder its meanings, whilst not neglecting Du`a, calling upon Allah, may He be Exalted, by His names .\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/188229/benefits-of-reciting-99-names-of-allah-daily
468827,"We live in a very rundown house that belongs to the state, and at any moment or any day now it will be demolished, because it belongs to the state. My father is stingy and does not want to rent or buy a house. Please note that his salary is high and he could afford that. My mother has been taking money from him without his knowledge, and she collected a sum of money and bought a piece of agricultural land for us to live on. Is this land haram? Please note that our house is very run down and belongs to the state.","[""Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nA house is something essential for humans, and if the father has provided accommodation for his wife and children to live in like that of their peers, then he is not obliged to do anything further from an Islamic point of view, unless he wants to buy a bigger house for them, if he can afford that. This is something that is recommended and encouraged according to Islamic teachings. It was narrated that Nafi‘ ibn ‘Abd al-Harith (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Part of a man’s happiness is a good neighbour, a comfortable means of transportation and a spacious house.” Narrated by Ahmad (15409); classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami‘ (3029).\nSo long as he is providing them with accommodation that is appropriate for them, even if that is by renting, or it is something granted by the government for them to live in, then the requirement is met, and owning the house one lives in is not a necessity or urgent need, so long as accommodation is available to him by renting or as a gift or loan.\nSecondly:\nIf the husband is spending on obligatory maintenance such as accommodation, clothing, food and drink, within reasonable limits, then it is not permissible for his wife to take anything from his money, because it is haram to take a person’s wealth without his willing consent, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{O you who have believed, do not consume one another's wealth unjustly but only [in lawful] business by mutual consent}\xa0[an-Nisa’ 4:29].\nAnd the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Indeed your blood, your wealth and your honour are sacred to you, as sacred as this day of yours, in this month of yours, in this land of yours. Let the one who is present convey it to the one who is absent.” Al-Bukhari (67).\nAnd he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “It is not permissible to take a man’s wealth except with his willing consent.” Ahmad (20172); classed as sahih by al-Albani in Irwa’ al-Ghalil (1495).\nBased on the above:\nWhat your mother collected from your father’s money and bought land with it does not come under the heading of wealth that it is permissible to take without the husband’s knowledge, because the wealth that it is permissible for a wife to take without the knowledge of her husband is limited to when he is failing to provide basic necessities.\nBut as this has already happened, it is essential to tell the father and put this land in his name and under his possession, if the father is still alive.\nIf it was bought in your mother’s name or in the name of one of you, then that must be changed, even if that is by means of a sale to the father.\nIf your father has passed on, then the house becomes part of his estate which is to be divided among the heirs, unless you all agree on something specific with the consent of all the heirs.\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/468827/what-is-the-ruling-on-taking-from-the-husbands-wealth-without-his-knowledge-to-buy-a-house-for-the-family
8868,What is the ruling on sisters making Salah in public?,"[""Praise be to Allah.Is it better for a woman to pray at home?\nِA woman should be protected and concealed from men as much as her guardian can do that. The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) preferred for women to pray in their houses and said that their reward for doing so is greater than their reward for praying in the mosque .\xa0\nIt was narrated from `Abdullah ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “A woman's prayer in her room is better than her prayer in her courtyard, and her prayer in her cabinet is better than her prayer in her room.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 570; At-Tirmidhi, 1173. This Hadith was classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Targhib wat Tarhib, 1/136).\xa0\n“Her room” refers to a woman`s own room in the house, and “her courtyard” refers to the central area (in a traditional Arabic house), off which all the rooms of the house open.\xa0\nA cabinet is like a small room inside the large room, in which personal items are stored. (Commentary from `Awn Al-Ma`bud).\xa0\nIt was narrated that Umm Humayd (may Allah be pleased with her) the wife of Abu Humayd As-Sa`idi (may Allah be pleased with him) came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said, “O Messenger of Allah, I like to pray with you.” He said, “I know that you like to pray with me, but your prayer in your room is better for you than your prayer in your courtyard and your prayer in your courtyard is better for you than your praying in your house, and your prayer in your house is better for you than your prayer in the mosque of your people, and your prayer in the mosque of your people is better for you than your prayer in my mosque.” So she issued orders that a prayer-place be prepared for her in the furthest and darkest part of her house, and she used to pray there until she met Allah (i.e., died).”\xa0(Narrated by Ahmad, 26550)\nThis Hadith was classed as authentic by Ibn Khuzaymah in his Sahih, 3/95; Ibn Majah, 5/595; Al-Albani in Sahih At-Targhib wat Tarhib, 1/135\xa0\nIt was narrated that `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “If the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had lived to see how women have started to behave, he would have prevented them [from going to the mosque] as the women of the Children of Israel were prevented.” I said, to `Umrah, “Were they prevented?” He said, “Yes.”\xa0 (Al-Bukhari, 831; Muslim, 445)\xa0\n`Abd Al-`Adhim Abadi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“The reason why their praying in their homes is better is because it is safer from temptation. This was later borne out by the way in which women began to make a wanton display of their adornments, hence `A`ishah said what she said.” (`Awn Al-Ma`bud, 2/193)\xa0\nCan women pray in public places?\nHence women should be careful when praying in public places, or go far away from where men can see them , and should not pray in a public place when the time of prayer comes, unless she has no other place in which to pray. \xa0\nShaykh `Abullah Al-Jibrin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“With regard to women, their houses are better for them. If they need to pray in the marketplace and there is a place that is screened off , there is nothing wrong with them praying there, in sha Allah.” (Fatawa Al-Mar`ah Al-Muslimah, 1/333)\xa0\nBut what some of the common people say, that a woman`s prayer is invalidated just because a man happens to see her, has no basis in Shari`ah at all. Women used to pray at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in one mosque and he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not rule their prayer to be invalid.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/8868/is-it-better-for-a-woman-to-pray-at-home
