444666,"I owe someone five thousand riyals, but at present I am not able to pay it off, and the lender is asking me to pay my debt. After discussing the matter with him, I found out that he does not mind receiving an iPhone as payment of the debt owed to him. The cash price of this mobile phone in the market is approximately five thousand riyals, or maybe a little more or less than that. My question is: I do not have five thousand riyals; is it permissible for me to buy the mobile phone on instalments for more than six thousand riyals, and give the phone to the lender in order to pay off the debt? Or is there something wrong with that?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThere is nothing wrong with you buying a mobile phone by instalments, then giving it to the lender to pay off the debt, if he agrees to that, because it is permissible to sell a debt in return for an item to be handed over now. But it is not permissible for do that in return for an item to be delivered later, because that comes under the heading of selling a debt for a debt, which is prohibited.\nIn al-Mudawwanah (2/357) it says: I said: How about we come to an agreement regarding a debt, so he bought the debt in return for some item to be delivered later on – is that permissible according to the view of Malik?\nHe said: That is not permissible, because this is selling debt for debt, which is not permitted. End quote.\nIt says in Kashshaf al-Qina‘ (8/283):\nMaking a deal with regard to debt means settling the debt by giving something of a different type of wealth. In that case it is an exchange, i.e., buying and selling, such as if he acknowledges that he owes him a particular item or has some debt that he owes him, then he gives him instead of that something that is permissible to give.\nThis may be divided into three categories, which he discussed when he said: If it is currency in exchange for another currency, then it is an exchange that comes under a particular ruling, because it is selling one of the two currencies (gold and silver) for the other. Therefore it is stipulated that the exchange should take place immediately.\nIf it is selling a product in exchange for currency, or exchanging currency for products, or it is exchanging one product for another, then it is like buying and selling, so it is stipulated that the precise specifications of the items in question should be known, because this is exchanging wealth for wealth.\nReaching a deal regarding a debt is valid and it is permissible to pay the debt with a different type of wealth, whether it is of greater or lesser value than the loan, because it is a sale transaction, on condition that it be delivered immediately, so that it does not turn into selling debt for debt. End quote.\nSecondly:\nIt is stipulated that your purchase of the mobile phone by instalments should be free of any haram elements, such as the stipulation of a penalty in the event of late payment, because that is a stipulation of riba and it is not permissible to accept that condition, even if you are determined not to delay any payment.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/444666/is-it-permissible-to-pay-off-someone-elses-loan-in-return-for-a-product
45841,What were the last words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) before he bade farewell to this world?,"['Praise be to Allah.The last words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) – before he bade farewell to this world – were: “O Allah, (with) the higher companions”.\xa0\nThis is the title that Al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) gave to a chapter in Kitab Al-Maghazi in his Sahih: “The last words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)”, where he quoted the Hadith of `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) who said:\xa0\nWhen the Prophet was healthy, he used to say, “No soul of a Prophet is taken until he has been shown his place in Paradise and then he is given the choice.” When death approached him while his head was on my thigh, he became unconscious and then recovered consciousness. He then looked at the ceiling of the house and said,\xa0“O Allah! (with) the highest companions."" I said (to myself), “He is not going to choose (to stay with) us.” Then I understood what he meant when he said that to us when he was healthy. The last words he spoke were, ""O Allah! (with) the highest companions.”\xa0(Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 4463; Muslim, 2444)\nThere is a report narrated by Ahmad (1691) from the Hadith of Abu `Ubaydah (may Allah be pleased with him), who said that the last words that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) spoke were, “Expel the Jews of the Hijaz and Najran from the Arabian Peninsula, and know that the most evil of people are those who took the graves of their Prophets as places of worship.” This was classed as authentic by Al-Albani in As-Sahihah, 1132.\xa0\nAnd Abu Dawud (5156)and Ibn Majah (2698) narrated that `Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The last words that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) spoke were, “The prayer, the prayer! And fear Allah with regard to those whom your right hands possess.” This was classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud. And there are other similar Hadiths.\xa0\nWhat is meant by these reports is that these are some of the last things that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, or they were the last pieces of advice that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) gave to his family and companions, and those who would be in authority after he was gone. These Hadiths are among the last things he said, but the Hadith of `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) is the last of all.\xa0(See Fayd Al-Qadir by Al-Manawi, 5/250 – 251)\xa0\nAs-Suhayli (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The reason why these – “O Allah, (with) the higher companions” – were the last words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is because they refer both to Tawhid and to Dhikr in the heart. It offers comfort to those who are unable to speak (when dying), because some people may not be able to speak out loud for some reason, but that does not matter if their hearts are steadfast in remembering Allah.” (Quoted by Al-Hafiz in Al-Fath, 8/138)\nFor more details, please refer to the following answers: 11575 , 113393 , 197199 , 222848 , and 258503 .\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45841/last-words-of-prophet-muhammad

I know of only one masjid that’s very far from me that does two all the time. The rest of them Allahualim I don’t know what they do. I supposed I could explore around. The question is, if I walk into the masjid and they give only one khuthba what should I do? Leave and pray dhur? I will I be sinful for coming to that masjid when I know sometimes they only give one?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nJurists have agreed that the Friday sermon is mandatory, and that the Jumu`ah prayer is not valid without it.\nIbn `Abd Al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said: ""There is a scholarly consensus that if the Imam does not deliver a sermon to the people, they do not pray except four [Rak`ahs].""

End quote from ""Al-Mughni"" (3/170).\nSecondly:\nThe majority of scholars opine that the two sermons are necessary for the Jumu`ah prayer, and that the prayer is not valid without them.\nIt is established from the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) that he used to deliver two sermons on Friday, sitting between them, and after him, the Rightly Guided Caliphs did the same. This guidance has been transmitted by the Ummah in both words and actions.\nJabir ibn Samurah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: ""The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) used to deliver a sermon standing, then he would sit, then stand and deliver a sermon standing."" Reported by Muslim (862).\nAnd Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: ""The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) used to deliver a sermon standing, then he would sit, then stand, just as you do now.""

End quote from ""Al-Mughni"" by Ibn Qudamah (3/173).\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: ""The Jumu`ah prayer is not valid without two sermons. Al-Qadi said: The majority of scholars stipulate two sermons for the validity of the Jumu`ah prayer."" End quote. Sharh An-Nawawi `ala Muslim (6/150).\nTherefore, if there is a mosque in your place of residence that delivers two sermons for the Jumu`ah prayer, as prescribed by the Sunnah and required by most scholars: you must pray with them. Do not pray in a mosque that performs the Jumu`ah prayer with only one sermon, even if that is done only occasionally, for you cannot be sure that they will pray with only one sermon at the time of your attendance. Rather, you must take precautions for your worship, and attend the Jumu`ah prayer, which is one of the greatest rituals of Islam, with those who establish it in the manner prescribed by the Sunnah, so that your Jumu`ah prayer is valid according to the majority of scholars. Do not risk your worship by praying with those whose prayer, according to the scholars, is not valid as Jumu`ah, making it necessary to repeat it as Dhuhr, if they cannot establish the Jumu`ah in the prescribed manner.\nFor more benefit, please see the answer to question no. (89676 )\nHis Eminence Sheikh `Abdul `Aziz Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: ""It happened that the Imam on Friday delivered only one sermon, and he was a man who led the prayer on behalf of the Imam due to the Imam\'s absence, and he was elderly, and after finishing his first sermon he told the people: Stand up for the prayer. So the people stood up and prayed, then afterwards many people disagreed, whether the prayer was valid or not? And we want your Eminence to enlighten us.""\nHe replied: ""The prayer is not valid, and he must return and deliver the second sermon, then repeat the prayer. Two sermons are required, as the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) did, and they are a condition for the validity of the prayer, this is the most correct opinion. Therefore, this man must repeat the prayer and his companions must repeat it with him, and in the future, two sermons must precede the prayer."" End quote, from ""Fatawa Nur `Ala Ad-Darb by Ibn Baz with care of Al-Shuwa`ir"" (13/222).\nHe was also asked: ""A person who delivers only one sermon for Jumu`ah, has he violated the Sunnah by doing that?""\nHe replied: ""Yes, two sermons are required. Two sermons are a condition for the validity of the Jumu`ah prayer, as the Prophet used to do (peace and blessings be upon him). If he delivers only one sermon, the Jumu`ah prayer is not valid, but he must deliver the second sermon and repeat the Jumu`ah prayer."" End quote, from ""Fatawa Nur `Ala Ad-Darb by Ibn Baz with care of Al-Shuwa`ir"" (13/295).\nHis Eminence Sheikh Muhammad ibn Salih Al-`Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: ""Is the Jumu`ah prayer valid with only one sermon?""\nHe replied: ""Two sermons are necessary for the Jumu`ah prayer; because the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) used to deliver two sermons for Jumu`ah. And he says (peace and blessings be upon him) in the Jumu`ah sermon: (As for what follows, the best speech is the Book of Allah and the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him)).\nIf he limits himself to only one sermon, he would be contrary to the guidance of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him); therefore, their Jumu`ah is not valid.\nThe Jumu`ah prayer must have two sermons. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) used to deliver two sermons and separate them with a sitting; so it is not sufficient for him to separate them with silence, rather he must sit; and sitting between the two sermons is from the guidance of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him), and it is a confirmed Sunnah, and the separation between the two sermons is not achieved except by sitting."" End quote, from Fatawa Nur `Ala Ad-Darb for Al-`Uthaymin"" (8/2 with automatic numbering by Al-Shamilah).\nSheikh Ibn `Uthaymin was also asked: ""It happened that the preacher forgot and delivered only one sermon to the people, then led them in prayer, and the question, Your Eminence, is: Is this Jumu`ah valid or not? And is it obligatory to repeat it for the Imam and the followers, or just the Imam, and then pray it as Dhuhr? May Allah guide you and make your steps firm and reward you with the best reward on behalf of Islam and the Muslims.""\nHe replied: ""It is obligatory for the Imam and the followers to repeat it as Dhuhr. 24/3/1416H."" End quote, from the collection of Fatawa and Letters of Al-`Uthaymin (16/79).\nThirdly:\nIf you go to a mosque, and you did not know that they perform the Jumu`ah prayer with only one sermon, and you find it so; you should not leave the prayer with the Muslim congregation for that reason. Rather, you must pray with them following the Imam, and do not differ with him.\nIf after that you can catch the Jumu`ah in another mosque in your neighborhood, or close to you, before they finish the prayer; then go to them and pray Jumu`ah with them.\nAnd if you cannot do that; it appears that there is no harm on you if you are satisfied with your prayer with the first Imam, even if he prayed with one sermon. The stipulation of two sermons is not a matter of consensus among scholars, but there is a considerable difference of opinion; although the preponderant opinion is what we have presented from the requirement of two sermons, and upon it are the fatwas of our scholars from the people of knowledge; but that does not negate the considerable difference of opinion on the issue.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: ""Malik, Al-Awza`i, Ishaq, Abu Thawr, Ibn Al-Mundhir, and the people of reason said: One sermon is sufficient for him. And it has been narrated from Ahmad what indicates this."" End quote from ""Al-Mughni"" by Ibn Qudamah (3/173).\nAnd if you were cautious, and the matter was so, and you repeated your prayer as Dhuhr, it would be better.\nAnd if there is no one in your place of residence who performs the Jumu`ah prayer with two sermons, or there is, but its location is far from you, and you think it most likely that you will not reach it except after missing the Jumu`ah with them, then pray with those who perform the Jumu`ah, even with one sermon.\nAnd strive to advise this Imam to establish the prayer with the people as prescribed by the Sunnah, and not to risk their worship, and not to expose them to hardship and difficulty. If there are among the people of the place those who do not see the prayer with one sermon, then what necessitates him to do that; let him pray with two sermons, so his prayer and Jumu`ah will be valid, and the Jumu`ah of those with him, by the agreement of the people, and the hearts will be united upon him, and he will not put those with him in difficulty.\nSheikh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: ""The Friday preacher in my country delivers only one sermon and does not sit in the usual sitting of the preachers before him, is this considered contrary to the Sunnah?""\nHe replied: ""Yes, this is contrary to the Sunnah without a doubt; for it is established from the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) that he used to deliver two sermons on the day of Jumu`ah, separating them with a sitting. In fact, most scholars say: The Jumu`ah prayer is not valid; because one of the conditions for the validity of the Jumu`ah prayer is that it be preceded by two sermons.\nTherefore, inform this Imam that his action is contrary to the Sunnah, and that his action, according to many scholars, means that his Jumu`ah is not valid, and tell him to fear Allah Almighty, and to follow the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) in his guidance, for the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him). We ask Allah for guidance for us and for him."" End quote, from the website of the Sheikh.\nIf he does not respond to you, or the congregation of the mosque overpowers him in that; then pray with them, and it does not appear that you are obliged to repeat it as Dhuhr, for you have done what you could, and the Jumu`ah is only with the people, and this is the Jumu`ah that you are able to attend. And in matters of considerable difference of opinion among scholars, it is prescribed for the follower to pray behind an Imam who differs from his madhhab, even if he does what is considered invalid according to the follower, or omits what is obligatory or a condition according to the follower.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n""As for those who differ in subsidiary matters, such as the followers of Abu Hanifah, Malik, and Ash-Shafi`i: the prayer behind them is valid and not disliked, as Ahmad explicitly stated; because the Companions, the Successors, and those after them: used to follow each other in prayer, despite their differences in subsidiary matters, so that was a consensus."" End quote, from ""Al-Mughni"" (2/11).\nSheikh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: ""About the followers of the four madhhabs: Is the prayer of some of them valid behind others? ... And if the Imam does what he believes is valid and the follower believes otherwise. Is it permissible? And is the prayer valid behind him? Or not?\nHe replied: Yes, it is permissible for some of them to pray behind others, as the Companions, the Successors, and those after them from the four Imams used to pray behind each other, despite their dispute in these mentioned issues and others.\nAnd no one from the predecessors said that some of them do not pray behind others, and whoever denies that is an innovator, misguided, contradicting the Book, the Sunnah, and the consensus of the predecessors of the Ummah and its Imams.\nAnd the Companions, the Successors, and those after them: some of them used to recite the Basmalah and some of them did not, and some of them used to recite it aloud and some of them did not, and some of them used to perform Qunut in Fajr and some of them did not, and some of them used to perform Wudu’ from cupping, nosebleeds, and vomiting, and some of them did not....""

1397,"Will Allah accept the prayer and good deeds of a person who is continually committing sin such as fortification even though in his/her heart the person is aware that he/she is sinning and is full of guilt and tries his/her very best not to continue committing such sin. Except for this weakness this person tries to be a good muslim e.g. never misses daily prayers, giving out time and money towards the cause of Allah, never taking alcohol or other un-halal foods etc.","['Praise be to Allah.Praise be to Allah.\nWill Allah accept your good deeds if you commit Zina?\nAllah will accept whatever righteous deeds from one who commits Zina , such as praying, fasting, giving charity etc., and He will also accept his repentance , as He says (interpretation of the meaning): “And He it is Who accepts repentance from His slaves, and forgives sins, and He knows what you do.” [Ash-Shu`ra’ 42:25]\nBut there is the condition that his repentance must be sincere . Does this person truly regret what he has done? Is he indeed determined not to repeat the sin? Has he, I wonder, gotten rid of everything that may lead him to sin, such as relationships, addresses, telephone numbers, going to evil places, bad friends, movies, pictures and so on? What we believe is that if this person truly repents, he will give up this sin.\nZina is one of the worst kinds of immoral deeds. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And come not near to the unlawful sexual intercourse. Verily, it is a Fahishah [i.e., anything that transgresses its limits, a great sin], and an evil way (that leads one to Hell unless Allah forgives him).” [Al-Isra’ 17:32]\nPunishment for Zina\xa0\nMarried people who commit Zina (adultery) are to be punished with the worst and most severe form of punishment , which is to be stoned to death, so that every part of their bodies may feel pain just as they felt pleasure in a prohibited manner even though they were not without a halal source of pleasure (i.e., within marriage).\xa0\nUnmarried people who commit Zina, and had never been married before, are to be given the maximum number of lashes prescribed in Shari`ah, which is one hundred lashes. In addition, they are subjected to the humiliation of having their punishment witnessed by a group of believers, and are to be banished for one full year from their city, the place where they committed the crime.\nPunishment for Zina in Al-Barzakh\nThe punishment for those who are guilty of Zina in Al-Barzakh (i.e., after death and before the Day of Resurrection) is that they will be in an oven, the top of which is narrow and the bottom of which is wide. A fire will be lit under it, and they will be naked in (that oven). When the fire is lit, they will scream and rise up until they almost come out of the oven, then when the fire subsides, they will go back down into it. This is what will keep happening to them until the Hour begins. So how will their punishment be in the Fire of Hell itself?\nWe ask Allah not to despise us and to accept our repentance; we ask Him to help us to do good and to avoid evil, for He is the All-Hearing, Ever-Near.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1397/will-allah-accept-good-deeds-if-one-commits-zina
