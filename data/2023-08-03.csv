327070,"I subscribed to a forex that offers Islamic accounts, and I noticed that it is sharia-compliant in the following ways: 1. There is no interest like Swap. 2. It only carries out instructions to buy or sell. 3. Low spreads, but there are appropriate fees, $3 for every trade. 4. When you close the deal, the profit is recorded in my account immediately; does this meet the condition of the exchange taking place on the spot? 5. The leverage is between 1:1 and 1:500, meaning that I can use the leverage 1:1, and thus I am not using leverage. Hence there is no loan that brings benefit or any combining a loan and a fee, but the profit will be very small unless I use the leverage. My question is: I believe, from what the company explained to me, that it is possible in this way to avoid using leverage without having to worry about it – what is your opinion? 6. Withdrawing the money takes a little time, one or two days, but sometimes I can withdraw it immediately, according to whether the company can afford it. This is what they offer in the Islamic accounts; is there anything haram in that?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly: The ruling on the Islamic forex\nWe have previously discussed the so-called Islamic forex in the answer to question 125758 , in which we explained that it is not permissible to deal with it, so long as it involves leverages, because it is a loan, and it is not permissible to combine a fee and a loan. The fee here refers to brokerage.\nSo if you are not going to use the leverage, you have avoided this infraction.\nIf you are going to use it, then you will undoubtedly fall into what is haram. There is nothing in the system of the company that makes that permissible as you thought.\nSecondly: One of the conditions of trading in currency is that the exchange takes place on the spot\nIn order for trading in different currencies to be valid, it is stipulated that the exchange takes place on the spot. If the exchange does not take place on the spot, it comes under the heading of riba an-nasi’ah.\nIn a statement of the Islamic Fiqh Council on the ruling on margins and one of the reasons for the prohibition, it says that buying and selling currencies is usually done without the exchange being made in the Islamically prescribed manner which allows each party to access what he receives in his account.\nThe fact that the money is recorded in your account with the company, without you being able to withdraw it until after one or two days, according to what the company can afford, means that this condition is not met.\nBased on that, it is not permissible to deal with this system.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/327070/ruling-on-subscribing-to-islamic-accounts-in-forex
20017,"If I want to travel by plane and the time of take-off is before `Asr begins, and the take-off of the second flight is immediately after the first plane lands, is it permissible to combine `Asr with Zuhr and shorten them in my home city? What is the ruling if I do that? What is the correct thing to do?","[""Praise be to Allah.It is permissible for the person who is not travelling to combine two prayers if it will be too difficult for him to perform the second prayer on time. Permission to join prayers is broader than permission to shorten them, because shortening them is allowed only to travelers , but both travelers and non-travellers are permitted to join prayers when it will be difficult to perform the second prayer, whether on time or in congregation.\nBased on this, it is permissible for you to bring `Asr forward and pray it with Zuhr in your home city, if you think it most likely that you will not be able to pray it on time because of travelling.\xa0\nIf the airport is outside your city, you can pray in the airport and shorten your prayers. If you live near the airport, then you can join the prayers but you cannot shorten them .\xa0\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymهn (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\nQuestion:\xa0\nIf a person is in Qasهm and goes out to the airport, can he shorten his prayers in the airport?\xa0\nAnswer:\xa0\n“Yes, he may shorten his prayers, because he has left the built-up area of his town, and all the villages that are around the airport are separate from the town. But if a person lives near the airport, he should not shorten his prayer, because he has not yet left the built-up area of his town.” (Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 4/514)\xa0\nIbn ‘Abbas said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prayed Zuhr and `Asr together in Madinah, at a time when there was no fear and he was not travelling. Abu’l-Zubayr said: I asked Sa’id [i.e., ibn Jubayr], Why did he do that? He said, I asked Ibn 'Abbas the same question, and he said, He did not want anyone among his ummah to suffer hardship. (Narrated by Muslim, 705)\xa0\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said:\xa0\n“The specific reason for shortening the prayers is travelling, and it is not permissible to shorten prayers when not travelling. With regard to joining prayers , the reason for it is if there is a need or an excuse. So if a person needs to do so, he may join prayers whilst travelling , whether he is travelling a long distance or a short one, and he may join prayers because of rain etc., or because of sickness etc., or for any other reason, because the point is to spare the Muslims any difficulty or hardship.” (Majmu’ al-Fatawa, 22/293; published by King Fahd Complex)\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20017/can-you-combine-prayers-before-travelling
