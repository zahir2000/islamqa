153442,"I work for a company, and when I apply for a job in another company, they ask me to tell them how much my current salary is. In the beginning, I could not find any opportunity to work for a salary that I deserve on the basis of my qualifications and experience, so I was forced to work for nearly half of that. Is it permissible for me, when I apply for a job and am asked about my current salary, to mention the salary that I deserve? Please note that the salary for the new job will be decided on the basis of my current salary.","['Praise be to Allah.If the Muslim is asked about his salary, it is not permissible for him to lie, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The signs of the hypocrite are three: when he speaks he lies, if he makes a promise he breaks it, and if he is entrusted with something he betrays that trust.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (33) and Muslim (59).\nIbn Mas‘ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Lying is not good, whether in earnest or in jest.\nNarrated by al-Bukhari in al-Adab al-Mufrad (387); classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Adab.\nIf you think that telling them your salary will be detrimental to you, you can refuse to answer, or you can explain to them that you accepted this low salary for some specific reason, and the like.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/153442/it-is-not-permissible-for-one-who-applied-for-a-job-if-he-is-asked-about-the-salary-he-is-currently-receiving-to-lie-about-it
161383,I was told that it was prohibited to eat or to bring food into the bathroom but when I told someone about this they laughed and said I was wrong. What is the ruling?,"['Praise be to Allah.Bathrooms are for relieving oneself, not for eating and drinking, so it is not appropriate for the Muslim to enter them except for the purpose of relieving himself, and when he enters the bathroom he should refrain from eating and drinking until he comes out.\xa0\nIf a person eats and drinks inside the bathroom when there is no need to do so, then he has done something which is contrary to sound human nature (Fitrah).\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about the ruling on eating and drinking in the bathroom.\xa0\nHe replied:\xa0\n“The bathroom is a place for relieving oneself only and one should not stay there longer than is necessary. Eating or doing other things there requires staying there for a length of time that is not appropriate.""

153418,"I work for an agricultural company, and they give me a ticket to travel to my city with a specific travel company. Is it permissible for me to book with this company, then cancel the booking and book with another company that costs less, and keep the difference? Or can I cancel the booking with the first company and travel by land, and keep the price of the air ticket?","['Praise be to Allah.It is permissible for the employee who is given a travel ticket by his work to make use of the price of the ticket and travel by land, or travel on a different airline than the one for which he was given a ticket, and keep the difference between the two prices, unless his work does not allow that.\nThe basic principle regarding that is paying attention to what was agreed upon between the two parties, namely the employee and the workplace, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{O you who have believed, fulfill [all] contracts}\xa0[al-Ma’idah 5:1];\nand the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The Muslims are bound by their conditions.” Narrated by Abu Dawud (3594); classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud.\nShaykh Dr. ‘Abd al-Karim al-Khudayr (may Allah preserve him) was asked: Is it permissible to sell government airline tickets given to me, because I travelled by land?\nHe replied: There is nothing wrong with selling the tickets if you do not need them, unless travelling by land will result in you being late in returning to work. In that case, it is not permissible for you to travel except by the approved means of transportation, namely by plane.
