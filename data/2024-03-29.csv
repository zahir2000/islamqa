407713,"I engaged in masturbation, and when I heard the call to the dawn prayer, I stopped immediately, but when I stopped, semen was discharged. Is my fasting valid?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nMasturbation is prohibited, and repentance is required for it.\nPlease see the answer to question number: (329 ).\nSecondly:\nIf you refrained from masturbation at the time of the Fajr call to prayer, and then semen was discharged involuntarily afterward: your fasting is valid.\nScholars (may Allah have mercy on them) have stated a similar issue, which is concerning someone who had intercourse at night and then ejaculated during the day, and they said: His fast is valid.\nIt is stated in ""Al-Jawhara An-Nayyira"" (1/138), which is a Hanafi text: ""If one who had intercourse feared the dawn\'s arrival, so he withdrew, and then ejaculated after dawn: he has not broken his fast."" End quote.\nAnd in ""Hashiyat Ad-Dasouqi"" (1/523), a Maliki text, it says:\n""If he had intercourse at night, and his semen was discharged after dawn: the apparent ruling is that there is nothing upon him, just as if someone applied kohl at night, and then the kohl reached his throat during the day."" End quote. Similar statements are found in ""Sharh Al-Kharshi on Mukhtasar Khalil"" (2/249).\nAl-Bahuti said in Kashshaf Al-Qina` (2/321), a Hanbali text: ""(Or if he ejaculates during the day from intercourse at night) he has not broken his fast; because he did not cause it during the day, or if he ejaculates at night from foreplay during the day: there is no breaking of the fast in all of that.""

69758,Is it permissible for a woman to enter the sanctuary of Madinah when she is menstruating? What should she do if she is menstruating and she enters the city of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)?,"['Praise be to Allah.Menstruating women are not forbidden to enter Makkah or Madinah. There is nothing in the texts to suggest that they are not allowed to enter these cities. Rather the texts indicate the opposite.\xa0\nWomen who come for Hajj and `Umrah can be menstruating and the only thing that they are not allowed to do is to circumambulate the Ka`bah.\n`Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) was with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) during the Farewell Pilgrimage and she got her menses before she entered Makkah, but he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not tell her not to enter the city until she became pure (her period ended)! Rather he told her to do all the rituals of Hajj except for Tawaf around the Ka`bah, which she was to delay until she became pure. He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do everything that the pilgrims do, but do not circumambulate the House until you become pure.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 305 and Muslim, 1211)\xa0\nDon’t the women who live in Madinah also menstruate? Do they go out of the city at that time? The point is that there is nothing wrong with a menstruating woman entering Makkah or Madinah and staying there. It is very clear and there is no need to look for evidence.\xa0\nWith regard to a menstruating woman entering the mosque (whether it is Al-Masjid Al-Haram in Makkah, or Al-Masjid An-Nabawi (the Mosque of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in Madinah), or any other mosque, we have explained in the answer to question no.\xa033649 \xa0that it is not permissible for a menstruating woman to enter the mosque.\xa0\nFor more details, please refer to the following answers: 60213 , 146758 , and 33649 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/69758/can-menstruating-women-enter-al-masjid-an-nabawi
406646,"I cleaned my ears during the daytime in Ramadan for 10 days; as I suffer from an allergy that causes itching and scratching in my ear, and I used to clean it as a usual habit, with or without scratching, and my cleaning was vigorous with a tissue, or with a stick that I insert as far as possible into the ear. I follow the Shafi`i school of thought, and I thought that cleaning the ear was only disliked, but when I read the ruling today and was shocked to find that it breaks the fast according to the Shafi`is. So, should I make up for the past days when I cleaned my ears, or is my fasting considered valid?","['Praise be to Allah.Cleaning the ears by inserting a tissue, a stick, or the like does not invalidate fasting according to the four schools of thought, and we have not come across any scholar\'s opinion that this invalidates fasting.\nHowever, if cleaning is done by pouring something into the ear, such as medicine or drops, and it reaches the inside of the brain, the majority of Jurists, and this is the most correct view according to Ash-Shafi`i, have opined that the fast is invalidated if medicine, oil, or water is used.\nAsh-Shafi`i has another opinion, which is that this does not invalidate the fast.\nAn-Nawawi said: ""If he pours water or something else into his ears, and it reaches his brain, he breaks his fast, according to the most correct view among us, and Al-Ghazali did not consider drops as a nullifier of the fast."" End quote from ""Al-Majmu`"" (6/320).\nAl-Baghawi said: ""If he eats something intentionally, even if little, or drinks, or uses nasal medicine, or nasal\xa0 or ear drops ; such that it reaches the brain, or has an enema, or uses drops in his urethra and it reaches the bladder - his fast is invalidated.\nIt is said: If he pours something into his ear, it does not invalidate his fast, even if its effect appears in the brain; because there is no passage from the ear to the brain, but it reaches it through the pores."" End quote from ""At-Tahdhib fi Fiqh Al-Imam Ash-Shafi`i"" (3/161).\nAl-`Imrani said: ""If he pours water into his ear, and it reaches his brain... there are two views: The first one - which is the view of Sheikh Abu Ishaq and Abu `Ali Al-Sanji - is that it invalidates his fast; because it reaches his brain, and it is like nasal medicine.\nThe second - which is the view of Al-Mas`udi: that it does not invalidate his fast; because it does not penetrate from the ear to the brain, but it reaches it through the pores."" End quote from ""Al-Bayan fi Madhhab Al-Imam Ash-Shafi`i"" (3/501).\nIt has been previously stated on our site in Fatwa No. (80208 ), that ear drops do not break the fast according to the more correct opinion.\nIn conclusion: Cleaning your ears while fasting with a tissue, a stick, or the like has no effect on the validity of your fast, and therefore you are not required to make up those days.\nIt appears that the information that reached you about breaking the fast by cleaning the ear was talking about cleaning the ear with water - ear flushing; this, and the like, is what invalidates the fast according to your school of thought.\nIf you have done that, then you must make up the days in which you cleaned your ears with water, or the like, because that invalidates the fast - according to the school of thought of Imam Ash-Shafi`i, which you follow.\nNevertheless, we advise you to abandon this harmful and dangerous habit and to consult a specialist doctor, as this behavior poses a risk to your ears.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/406646/does-cleaning-ears-affect-the-fast
