453133,"I own a house, and a tenant came and agreed with me that he would rent the house for one year, paying $100 for each four-month period. So he paid me $300 in return for living in the house for a year. Then the earthquake came and destroyed the house, and the man and his wife died.","['Praise be to Allah.If someone rents out a house and it is destroyed, the rental contract is annulled for the remaining period, but rent must be paid for the past as agreed.\nIn al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (7/26) it says: The jurists are agreed that if the rented item is destroyed, then the rental contract is annulled, such as if a specific mount dies or a rented house collapses. End quote.\nIt says in ar-Rawd al-Murbi‘ (p. 414): The rental contract is annulled if the rented item is destroyed, such as a mount or slave who dies, because the benefit of it is lost entirely.\nIf the destruction occurs within the rental period, then what remains is annulled but the past rent should be paid. End quote.\nSo if the tenant had lived in the house for two months out of that year, this is one sixth of the rental period, so one sixth of the rent should be paid, which is fifty dollars. And you must return the remaining amount to his heirs.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/453133/he-rented-out-his-house-for-one-year-then-it-was-destroyed-in-the-earthquake-what-is-he-entitled-to-of-the-rent
408677,How should one who is menstruating pray istikharah?,"['Praise be to Allah.It is prescribed for one who is menstruating, if she wants to pray istikharah, to offer the supplication of istikharah without praying (salah).\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Adhkar (p. 120): If a person is not able to pray, he may still recite the supplication of istikharah. End quote.\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Is it permissible to pray istikharah without praying two rak‘ahs beforehand, or without wudu’? And is it permissible for the menstruating woman or woman who is bleeding postpartum to pray istikharah?\nHe replied: Yes, it is permissible to pray istikharah, it is mustahabb (recommended), and it is recommended to pray istikharah even without praying (salah) beforehand, because the person is asking of his Lord, and seeking guidance from his Lord, whether the person is a woman or a man, and whether the woman is menstruating or not. There is nothing wrong with any of that, but if it is done after praying (salah), that is better, because then it is praying istikharah in accordance with the Sunnah. So the individual should pray two rak‘ahs, then ask of his Lord, and ask his Lord for guidance, whether the person is a man or a woman. But if the woman is menstruating, or the matter is urgent, then one may pray istikharah without praying (salah) beforehand. There is nothing wrong with that, and he may ask of his Lord, praise be to Allah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): {Call upon Me; I will respond to you [Ghafir 40:60]. Istikharah is a supplication in which one turns to Allah for guidance.""(Fatawa Nur ‘ala ad-Darb).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/408677/how-should-one-who-is-menstruating-pray-istikharah
