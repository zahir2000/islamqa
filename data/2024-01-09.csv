218843,Can we say “Ma sha Allah” if we see a talent or a good deed on the part of a person who is not Muslim?,"['Praise be to Allah.Causing harm to someone by means of the evil eye or envy (hasad) is a kind of transgression against the afflicted person. It is not permissible to transgress against anyone whose life and property are protected by Islamic law, and it is prescribed to offer supplication asking that the evil eye be warded off from him.\nIbn Majah (3509) narrated that one of the Sahabah saw another man bathing and admired his skin, thus afflicting him with his eye. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Why would any one of you kill his brother? If he sees something that he likes in his brother, then let him pray for blessing for him.” Classed as sahih by Shaykh al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) in Sahih Sunan Ibn Majah. For more information on what the Muslim should say if he sees something that he likes or admires, please see the answer to question no. 130786 .\nMention of the brother in the hadith, where the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) says, “If he sees something that he likes in his brother” does not mean that the disbeliever whose life and wealth are protected by Islamic law is not included in this ruling. If a disbeliever is not in a state of war with the Muslims, his blood, life and wealth are protected, so it is not permissible to transgress against him. Al-San‘ani (may Allah have mercy on him) said – regarding the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), “Reviling a Muslim is evildoing” – if the person is a mu‘ahad [a non-Muslim living under Muslim rule], then that is harming him, and it is forbidden to harm him… But if he is a harbi [a non-Muslim whose people are at war with the Muslims], it is permissible to revile him, because he has no protection.""(Subul al-Salaam\xa02/663).\nBased on that, the disbeliever whose people are at war with the Muslims has no protection, but for the disbeliever whose people are not at war with the Muslims, it is not permissible to transgress against him.\nMoreover, it is permissible for a Muslim to do ruqyah for a disbeliever if he has been harmed or is unwell, so it is more appropriate that it be permissible to ward off harm for him before it happens, by praying for blessing for whatever one likes or admires in the disbeliever.\nFor more information on the issue of it being permissible for a Muslim to do ruqyah for a disbeliever, please see the answer to question no. 6714 .\nBut here we must note an important matter, which is that envy (hasad) is a blameworthy characteristic according to the religion of Allah, even if it is envy of a disbeliever. The first one who is harmed by envy is the envier himself, and envy is not something that Islam teaches to its followers or encourages them to behave in such a manner, even with disbelievers.\nIt was narrated that ‘A‘ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: Some Jewish people came to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and said: Al-sam ‘alayka (death be upon you), O Abu’l-Qasim.\nHe said: “Wa ‘alaykum (and also upon you).”\n‘A‘ishah said: I said: Rather may death and shame be upon you.\nThe Messenger of Allah (S) said: “O ‘A‘ishah, do not be harsh.”\nAccording to one report, he said: “Enough, O ‘A‘ishah, for Allah does not like harshness and harsh words.”\nShe said: Did you not hear what they said?\nHe said: “Did I not respond to what they said? I said: Wa ‘alaykum (and also upon you).”\nNarrated by al-Bukhari (6038) and Muslim (2165).\nThe relevant part of the hadith is that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not want ‘A‘ishah\xa0 to be harsh and speak harsh words, even if that was in retaliation to those Jews. Undoubtedly envy is like harsh words in that regard; in fact it is worse, as is obvious. However, the fact that the Muslim is not allowed to envy someone else or afflict him with his evil eye is one thing, and his praying for blessing for him and offering supplication for him is something else.\nWhat appears to us to be the case – and Allah knows best – is that even if the Muslim is not allowed to envy disbelievers or harm them with his evil eye, it is not required of him to pray for blessing for him and offer supplication for him.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/218843/is-it-permissible-to-pray-for-blessing-if-you-see-something-you-like-in-a-disbeliever
222367,What is Tahlil marriage?,"['Praise be to Allah.What is Tahlil marriage?\nThe husband is given the option of taking back his wife if he has divorced her (by Talaq) twice, and this is called revocable divorce . Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“The divorce is twice, after that, either you retain her on reasonable terms or release her with kindness.” [Al-Baqarah 2:229]\nIf he divorces her a third time, then she becomes prohibited for him and it is not permissible for him to marry her with a new marriage contract and mahr unless she marries someone other than him, in a valid and genuine marriage, then he (second husband) consummates the marriage with her, then divorces her or dies and leaves her a widow. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And if he has divorced her (the third time), then she is not lawful unto him thereafter until she has married another husband. Then, if the other husband divorces her, it is no sin on both of them that they reunite, provided they feel that they can keep the limits ordained by Allah. These are the limits of Allah, which He makes plain for the people who have knowledge.” [Al-Baqarah 2:230]\nIt was narrated from `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that Rifa`ah Al-Qurathi (may Allah be pleased with him) married a woman then he divorced her, issuing a third divorce. Then she married another man, then she came to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and told him that he did not have intercourse with her, and the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) understood that she wanted to go back to Rifa`ah, so he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “No, not until he (the second husband) tastes your sweetness and you taste his sweetness [A metaphor for consummation of the marriage].” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 5011 and Muslim, 1433)\nForms of Tahlil marriage\nIt is not permissible for the man who issued the divorce, or for the woman, to use tricks to get around the laws of Allah and get back together by means of what is called a Tahlil marriage.\xa0\nThis kind of marriage takes several forms, including the following:\n\nWhere the husband who had issued the divorce, or the woman, or her guardian, hire a human “billy-goat”, and stipulate that he must marry the divorced woman, consummate the marriage with her, then divorce her, and they give him a sum of money in return for that!\nWhere a man marries that divorced woman without making any agreement with anybody, but his aim is to make her permissible for the first husband, then he divorces her.\n\nTahlil marriages are prohibited and invalid , and those who do that deserve to be cursed.\n`Abdullah ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) cursed the Muhallil and the Muhallal lahu. [The Muhallil is the one who marries a woman and divorces her so that she can go back to her first husband, and the Muhallal lahu is the first husband.] (Narrated and classed as authentic by At-Tirmidhi, 1120; also narrated by An-Nasa’i, 3416)\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“It was classed as authentic by Ibn Qattan and Ibn Daqiq Al-`Eid according to the conditions of Al-Bukhari.” (At-Talkhis Al-Habir, 3/72)\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“With regard to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) cursing them [the Muhallil and the Muhallal lahu], this is either telling that Allah, may He be Exalted, has cursed them, or it is a supplication for them to be cursed. This indicates that it is prohibited and is a major sin.” (Zad Al-Ma`ad fi Hadiy Khayr Al-`Ibad, 5/672)\n`Uqbah ibn `Amir (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Shall I not tell you of a borrowed billy-goat?” They said, Yes, O Messenger of Allah. He said, “He is Al-Muhallil. May Allah curse Al-Muhallil and Al-Muhallal lahu.” (Narrated by Ibn Majah, 1936; classed as sound by Al-Albani in Saheeh Ibn Majah)\nIs Tahlil marriage valid?\nThese Hadiths indicate that Tahlil marriage is prohibited, and that it is a major sin; they also indicate that it is not valid.\nIt says in Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah (10/256, 257):\n“The majority of scholars – the Malikis, Shafi`is, Hanbalis and Abu Yusuf among the Hanafis – are of the view that Tahlil marriage is invalid, because of the two Hadiths quoted above, and because marriage for the purpose of Tahlil comes under the same heading as temporary marriage, and stipulating that a marriage is to be temporary renders it invalid. So long as the marriage is invalid, no Tahlil occurs thereby [i.e., it does not make it permissible for the woman to go back to her first husband after the second marriage ends] This is supported by the view of `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: “By Allah, no Muhallil or Muhallal lahu will be brought to me but I will stone them.”\xa0\nShaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“This is one of the most abhorrent kinds of falsehood, and one of the gravest kinds of corruption. He is in effect a Zani (fornicator or adulterer), because he did not marry her so that she could be a wife to him, and keep him chaste and stay with him, and so that he might hope to have children from her. No, rather he came as a borrowed billy-goat, to make her permissible for the one who came before him, by having intercourse with her once, then leaving her and finishing with her. This is the Muhallil; his marriage is invalid and is not legitimate, and she does not become permissible for the first husband so long as (the second husband ) married her with this intention and for this purpose. It is an invalid marriage and she is not permissible for him or for the first husband, because this is not a marriage, and Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “until she has married another husband” [Al-Baqarah 2:230] This is a borrowed billy-goat, not a legitimate husband, and he does not make her permissible for the first husband.” (Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 20/277, 278)\nDoes mentioning the condition of Tahlil in the marriage contract make it valid?\nWith regard to the prohibition on Tahlil marriage and its invalidity , it makes no difference whether the condition of Tahlil is specifically mentioned in the marriage contract or if the agreement is made beforehand and not mentioned at the time of the marriage contract, or the second husband had that intention without anybody stipulating it or coming to some agreement to that effect with him. In all these cases, it is a Tahlil marriage and is prohibited.\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“There is no difference of opinion, according to the people of Madinah, the scholars of Hadith and the jurists, whether that is stipulated verbally or by implicit agreement and intention, because in their view the intention behind contracts carries weight, and actions are judged by intentions, and in their view a condition was agreed implicitly is like one that was spoken aloud, because words are not sought in and of themselves, but because of the meaning to which they point. So once the meaning and intention become clear, the actual words do not matter, because they are just the means (of expressing what is in the heart) and in this case that aim has been achieved, therefore the rulings are to be based on the aims.” (Zad Al-Ma`ad fi Hadiy Khayr Al-`Ibad, 5/110)\nThe scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas said:\n“If a man marries a woman on condition that it be for the purpose of Tahlil, or he intends that , or they both agree to that, then the marriage contract is invalid and the marriage is not legitimate.” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 18/439)\nAl-Bayhaqi (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated in As-Sunan Al-Kubra (7/208) from Nafi` (may Allah have mercy on him) that he said: A man came to `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) and asked him about a man who divorced his wife three times , then a brother of his married her without any prior agreement with him, so as to make her permissible for his brother – does she become permissible for the first husband? He said: No, unless it is a genuine marriage. We used to regard this as fornication at the time of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nShaykh Muhammad ibn Salih Al-`Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“If the second husband has the intention that when he has made her permissible for the first husband he will divorce her, then she does not become permissible for the first husband, and the marriage is invalid. The evidence for that is that this is the intention of Tahlil, so it is included in the curse. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Actions are but by intentions, and each person will have but that which he intended.” (Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti` `Ala Zad Al-Mustaqni`, 12/176, 177)\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) listed all the forms in one place, and regarded them all as forms of Tahlil marriage which is prohibited and invalid.\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Tahlil marriage is prohibited and invalid, and it does not make it permissible (for the woman to go back to her first husband). What it means is that if a man divorces his wife three times , then she becomes prohibited for him until she has married another husband, as Allah, may He be Exalted, states in His Book, and as is stated in the Sunnah of His Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and the Ummah unanimously agreed on that. If another man marries her with the intention of divorcing her so that she will become permissible for her first husband, this marriage is prohibited and invalid, whether he decides after that to keep her or to leave her, and whether that is stipulated in the marriage contract, or was stipulated before the marriage contract, or was not stipulated verbally… Or none of that happened; rather the man decided to marry her, then divorce her so that she would become permissible for the one who had divorced her three times, without the woman or her guardian being aware of any of that, whether the husband who had divorced her three times was aware of it or not, such as if the Muhallil thought that this was a good deed and a favour to the man who had divorced her and his wife, by helping her to go back to him because he thought that the divorce had caused harm to them and their children and their families, and so on.\nIn fact, it is not permissible for the one who divorced his wife three times to marry her again until she has been married by a man who wanted a genuine marriage, not a sham marriage, and he consummated the marriage with her in the sense that she tasted his sweetness and he tasted her sweetness, then after that if they happened to be separated by death or divorce or annulment of the marriage, then it is permissible for the first one to marry her.… This is what is indicated by the Quran and Sunnah, and it is what was narrated from the companions of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and from all of those who followed them in truth, and the majority of the Muslim jurists. … This is the view of Malik ibn Anas and all his companions, and of Al-Awza`i, Al-Layth ibn Sa`d, and Sufyan ath-Thawri; it is also the view of Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal among the scholars of Hadith, including Ishaq ibn Rahawayh, Abu `Ubayd Al-Qasim ibn Salam, Sulayman ibn Dawud Al-Hashimi, Abu Khaythamah Zuhayr ibn Harb, Abu Bakr ibn Abi Shaybah, Abu Ishaq Al-Jawzajani and others. It is also the view of Ash-Shafi`i.” (Iqamat Ad-Dalil `Ala Ibtal At-Tahlil, p. 6-8).

201417,"We often find written in people’s messages the verse {And your Lord is going to give you, and you will be satisfied} [al-Duha 93:5], which Allah addressed to His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Does the blessing mentioned in this verse include everyone?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nWriting this verse in messages comes under the heading of quoting from the Book of Allah, may He be exalted. We have noted previously that quoting [from the Quran] is permissible in general terms, if it is done for a valid reason, but if it is not done for a valid reason, then it is not permissible.\nSecondly:\nThe words of Allah, may He be exalted, to His Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), {And your Lord is going to give you, and you will be satisfied} [al-Duha 93:5] mean that He, may He be glorified and exalted, will give His slave and Messenger Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), by His grace and bounty, that which would make him satisfied in this world and the hereafter.\nAl-Shawkani (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhat appears to be the case is that Allah, may He be glorified, would give him what would please him of the best of this world and the hereafter, and one of the most important of these things to him and one of the most significant is the acceptance of his intercession for his ummah.""(Fath al-Qadir\xa0 5/649).\nSuch a thing obviously cannot be for everyone. To suggest that Allah would give to a specific person until he is content and satisfied is not permissible, except on the basis of a religious text.\nThirdly:\nThe ruling on quoting this verse varies from one situation to another:\n\nIf it is quoted by way of being optimistic, there is nothing wrong with that.\nIf it is quoted by way of showing care to a Muslim who is suffering and shows patience – so one says to him for example: Be patient and your Lord will give you, and you will be satisfied, in sha Allah – there is nothing wrong with that either, because this comes under the heading of offering consolation and thinking positively of Allah, especially if he follows it by saying “in sha Allah.”\nIf it is quoted by way of being certain of receiving good reward from Allah until one is satisfied, that is not permissible, because no one can decide what Allah, may He be exalted, should do, either in this world or in the hereafter.\nIf it is quoted by someone by way of claiming that that is the reason why Allah restored to him what he had lost, that is not permissible either.\n\nPlease see the answer to question no. 134346 .\nIf it is quoted in general terms when sending a message, or it is quoted in a gathering, or a person writes it on social media and the like, in general terms, then that is not permitted either, because generalising it means that all good and bad things may be included. One of these bad things is what the questioner has mentioned, of imagining this blessing reaching all people, which is definitely impossible and it is attributing to Allah, may He be exalted, something that is not true and it is praising someone who does not deserve to be praised at all.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/201417/does-the-blessing-mentioned-in-the-verse-and-your-lord-is-going-to-give-you-and-you-will-be-satisfied-include-all-the-ummah
138389,Can you advise me as to how a seeker of knowledge can make a schedule to organise his time?,"[""Praise be to Allah.Status of seeking knowledge in Islam\xa0\nThe status of seeking Islamic knowledge is great in Islam. Allah, may He be blessed and Exalted, has praised knowledge and those who seek it, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Say: Are those who know equal to those who know not?’ It is only men of understanding who will remember (i.e. get a lesson from Allah's Signs and Verses.)” [Az-Zumar 39:9]\n“It is only those who have knowledge among His slaves that fear Allah.” [Fatir 35:28]\xa0\nHumayd ibn `Abd Ar-Rahman (may Allah have mercy on him) said: I heard Mu`awiyah say, when he was delivering a khutbah: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “When Allah wills good for a person, He deepens his knowledge of Islam. (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 71; and Muslim, 1037)\xa0\n`Abu Ad-Darda’ (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “Whoever follows a path in the pursuit of knowledge, Allah will make easy for him a path to Paradise. The angels lower their wings in approval of the seeker of knowledge , and everyone in the heavens and on earth prays for forgiveness for the seeker of knowledge, even the fish in the sea. The superiority of the scholar over the worshipper is like the superiority of the moon over all other heavenly bodies. The scholars are the heirs of the Prophets, for the Prophets did not leave behind Dinars or Dirhams, rather they left behind knowledge, so whoever takes it has taken a great share.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 2682, Abu Dawud, 3541 and Ibn Majah, 223; classed as sound by Al-Albaani in Saheeh At-Targheeb, 1/17)\nIslamic knowledge brings a person the good of this world and of the Hereafter; it takes precedence over all other branches of knowledge, especially if one’s intention is pure.\xa0\nHow to start your journey of seeking knowledge in Islam\nThe best thing you can spend your time on when beginning to seek knowledge is memorising the Book of Allah , may He be Glorified and Exalted. This is the best thing in which people may compete and strive, and it is the best thing on which the seeker of knowledge may focus his efforts.\xa0\nHow to make seeking knowledge an easy task\nOne of the things that will make things easier for the seeker of knowledge is to have many shaykhs and scholars from whom he can learn . The quickest way to seek knowledge and the best way to attain the goal is if Allah makes it easy for him to find one shaykh or scholar among the scholars of the Sunnah, from whom he may acquire knowledge directly.\xa0\nHow knowledge seekers organise their time\nWith regard to organising your time, it may be as follows.\xa0\n\nHave fixed times for regular things every day, such as a time for sleeping, a time for meals, a time for visits, a time for gatherings, a time for revision.\xa0\n\n\nOne of the things that will help you make the most of your time and save time is to put a stop to time wasters such as sleeping, eating and drinking too much, or meeting people except for Islamically beneficial purposes. You should also avoid time wasters such as means of entertainment like TV shows, soap operas, newspapers, magazines, games, sports matches and competitions.\xa0\n\nShaykh Muhammad ibn Salih Al-`Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“The seeker of knowledge must make the most of his time and avoid wasting time. Wasting time may take the following forms:\xa0\n\nFailing to review and revise what he reads\nSitting with his friends and engaging in idle talk in which there is no benefit\nThe most harmful time waster for the seeker of knowledge is when he has no interest except finding out about people, what they are saying and what they are doing, with regard to a matter that does not concern him. This undoubtedly stems from a weakness of commitment to Islam, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Part of a person’s being a good Muslim is leaving alone that which does not concern him.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 2318; classed as authentic by Al-Albani)\n\nFocusing on who said what and asking a lot of questions is a waste of time. In fact it is a kind of sickness which if it affects a person – we ask Allah to keep us safe and sound – will become his main focus and concern and he may end up showing a hostile attitude towards one who does not deserve enmity, or he may be friendly towards one who does not deserve friendship, because of his interest in these matters that are distracting him from seeking knowledge, on the grounds that this is part of supporting the truth. But that is not the case; rather this comes under the heading of being distracted by that which does not concern one. But if news comes to you without you seeking it or looking for it, everyone receives news but you should not be preoccupied with it or focus on it, because this causes distraction for the seeker of knowledge and may confuse him, and it opens the door to partisanship and division amongst the ummah.” (Kitab Al-`Ilm, pp. 143-144)\xa0\n\nAnother matter that is detrimental to the issue of organising one’s time and making the most of it is procrastination. Procrastination is a severe disease that deprives one of many good things in this world and in the Hereafter.\xa0\n\n\nOne of the best ways of succeeding in this world is to keep yourself busy at all times with that which is best for you and most beneficial for you in the Hereafter, as Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The best act of worship is to strive to please the Lord at all times by doing that which is most appropriate and is expected at any particular time.” (Madarij As-Salikin, 1/88)\xa0\n\n\nInvesting one’s time as much as one can and not wasting a single moment in anything that is not an act of obedience or worship. Our early generations (may Allah have mercy on them) set an amazing example of making the most of their time. All seekers of Quranic knowledge were keen to study under Abu Na`im Al-Asfahani (may Allah have mercy on him; d. 430) and every day one of them would have his turn and he would study whatever he wanted with the Shaykh until just before Dhuhr. Then when he got up to go home, another student might recite a Juz’ to him on the way (for him to listen and correct), and he never showed any impatience.\xa0\n\nSalim Ar-Razi (may Allah have mercy on him) was a Shafi`i. One day he went home and came back, and he said: I recited a juz’ on my way. Adh-Dhahabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his biography of Al-Khatib Al-Baghdadi: Al-Khatib used to walk with a Juz’ in his hand, which he would study.\xa0\nFor forty years, Ibn `Asakir (may Allah have mercy on him) – as his son said – did not focus on anything except matters of knowledge, even during his free time or when he was alone. He always had with him books of knowledge and the Quran, which he would read and memorise. They were always keen to make the most of their time by doing more than one thing at the same time. If the pen became blunt and he needed to sharpen it, one of them would move his lips with remembrance of Allah whilst fixing his pen, or he would review things that he had memorised lest any time pass without him doing something useful.\xa0\nAbu Al-Wafa’ `Ali ibn `Aqil (may Allah have mercy on him) said: I do not allow myself to waste even one hour of my life; even when I am not reading anything or reciting anything, I would think whilst I am resting of some issues of knowledge and I will not get up until I have come up with something I can write down.\xa0\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: I know someone who fell sick with a headache and fever, and his book was beside his head. When he was awake he would read, and when he fell asleep he would put it down.\xa0\nSuggested schedule for knowledge seekers in Islam\xa0\nWith regard to making a schedule and organising one’s time, that may be done as follows:\xa0\n\nThe program of the seeker of knowledge begins at dawn, which is the time for memorisation of Quran and Hadith. The best time for memorising – especially memorising Quran – is the time just before dawn and after Fajr prayer, when the mind is clear and it is easier to memorise. So the seeker of knowledge prays in the mosque and remains there until sunrise or afterwards, memorising and reviewing what he has memorised. When he has finished that, he begins to memorise texts of knowledge – the texts of Hadith, Fiqh, Usool [principles of Fiqh] and Arabic language.\xa0\nIf he has a job or is in school, he goes to it. Otherwise he spends the rest of the morning memorising and revising until Dhuhr, then he takes a siesta and rests a little.\xa0\nAs for the afternoon, it is for studying and reading, or studying with others, or discussion and reviewing issues of knowledge with others.\xa0\nAfter Maghrib, he attends study circles and after `Isha’ he reviews what he has learnt or he may read a new book.\xa0\n\nIt should be noted that what we have mentioned here comes under the heading of organising time in general terms. Each student should organise his time according to his circumstances, whether he is working or not, whether he is married or single, whether he devotes all his time to Islamic knowledge or he has some other preoccupations, and so on. What matters with regard to organising time is that there should be some hours of the day and night in which he makes himself memorise and read. People tend to want to rest and like to be somewhat lazy, so he should train himself to work hard and be active, and he should make himself get used to being organised and adhere to doing acts of worship and obedience. Otherwise he will have wasted his day and then he will have wasted his life.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/138389/how-knowledge-seekers-organise-their-time
