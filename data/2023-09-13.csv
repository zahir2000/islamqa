408677,How should one who is menstruating pray istikharah?,"['Praise be to Allah.It is prescribed for one who is menstruating, if she wants to pray istikharah, to offer the supplication of istikharah without praying (salah).\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Adhkar (p. 120): If a person is not able to pray, he may still recite the supplication of istikharah. End quote.\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Is it permissible to pray istikharah without praying two rak‘ahs beforehand, or without wudu’? And is it permissible for the menstruating woman or woman who is bleeding postpartum to pray istikharah?\nHe replied: Yes, it is permissible to pray istikharah, it is mustahabb (recommended), and it is recommended to pray istikharah even without praying (salah) beforehand, because the person is asking of his Lord, and seeking guidance from his Lord, whether the person is a woman or a man, and whether the woman is menstruating or not. There is nothing wrong with any of that, but if it is done after praying (salah), that is better, because then it is praying istikharah in accordance with the Sunnah. So the individual should pray two rak‘ahs, then ask of his Lord, and ask his Lord for guidance, whether the person is a man or a woman. But if the woman is menstruating, or the matter is urgent, then one may pray istikharah without praying (salah) beforehand. There is nothing wrong with that, and he may ask of his Lord, praise be to Allah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): {Call upon Me; I will respond to you [Ghafir 40:60]. Istikharah is a supplication in which one turns to Allah for guidance.""(Fatawa Nur ‘ala ad-Darb).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/408677/how-should-one-who-is-menstruating-pray-istikharah
417506,"What is the ruling on participating in building a school with a real estate investor by means of a share system, in which the profits are a percentage of the value of the shares and will increase with time to reach the maximum amount in the fourth year?","['Praise be to Allah.It is permissible for a group of people to participate with a real estate investor to build a private school by means of a share system, but the profit must be a known percentage of the total profit, such as 50% of the profit, for example, going to the real estate investor and 50% going to the shareholders, to be distributed among them according to the number of shares each of them holds. It is not permissible for the profit on the shares to be a percentage of the value of the shares, because that is like stipulating a certain amount of money [as profit], which is not permissible in any partnership.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If the share of one of the partners is defined as a known amount of money, or he will receive in addition to his share of the profit a specific amount of money, such as stipulating that he will have his percentage of the profit plus ten dirhams, the partnership is rendered invalid.\nIbn al-Mundhir said: All of the scholars from whom we acquired knowledge are unanimously agreed that a profit-sharing partnership is rendered invalid if one or both of the partners stipulate that he will receive a known amount of money. Those from whom we learned that include Malik, al-Awza‘i, ash-Shafa‘i, Abu Thawr and ashab ar-ra’y.""(Al-Mughni\xa0 5/23).\nIn al-Ma‘ayir al-Shar‘iyyah (p. 198) it says: It is not permissible for the conditions or bylaws of a partnership governing the distribution of profits to include any clause that leads to the possibility of putting a stop to the sharing of the profits. If there is any such clause, then the contract is invalid. It is not permissible for one of the partners to stipulate that he will receive a specific amount of the profits or a percentage of the capital.
