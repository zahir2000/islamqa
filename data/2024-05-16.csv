307344,Why does the Quran state that women are required to cover their heads in order to have their prayers accepted by Allah but men are not required to do so?,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly, the basic principle is that the rulings apply equally to men and women, as the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said about women: ""They are counterparts to men."" Reported by Al-Bazzar in his Musnad (6418), and authenticated by Shaykh Al-Albani in ""As-Silsilah As-Sahihah"" (2863).\nIbn Al-Arabi Al-Maliki said in ""Al-Masalik"" (2/423): ""It has been narrated that \'women are counterparts to men,\' meaning that their creation is the same, and the rulings for them in Shari`ah are equal."" End quote.\nThis is a matter upon which there is scholarly consensus, as Al-Rajraji stated in ""Raf` Al-Niqab `An Tanqih Ash-Shihab"" (3/217): ""Consensus has been reached that women and men are equal in legal obligations, except for what is indicated by evidence.""\nSecondly, of the rulings where women differ from men is the obligation for a woman to cover her head during Salah;\xa0as a condition for the validity of the prayer is to cover the `Awrah with something that does not describe the skin; as Allah Almighty says (translation of the meaning): {O children of Adam, take your adornment at every mosque} [Al-A`raf/31].\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: ""Allah does not accept the prayer of a menstruating woman except with a headscarf (khimar)."" Reported by Abu Dawud (627), At-Tirmidhi (375), Ibn Majah (655), and authenticated by Al-Albani in ""Al-\'Irwa\'"" (196).\nThere is no disagreement among the scholars regarding the obligation for a woman to cover her head, both inside and outside of the prayer.\nIbn Al-Qattan Al-Fasi said in his book: ""Al-Iqna` fi Masa\'il Al-Ijma`"": ""It is obligatory for a woman to cover her entire body except for her face, and if she does so, her prayer is valid by consensus.\nAnd they unanimously agreed that a free adult woman must cover her head when she prays.\nAnd they unanimously agreed that if she prays with her entire head uncovered, she must repeat the prayer."" End quote (1/121-122).\nThirdly, in reality, the difference here is not between the rulings for women in prayer and the rulings for men in prayer, but rather the prayer here and the covering of the `Awrah in it is an extension of the distinction made by Allah, the Exalted, between the clothing of women and the clothing of men. Generally, in all situations, whether in prayer or otherwise, a man is not required to cover his head, and a woman, in all her situations, whether in prayer or otherwise, is not permitted to uncover her head except in front of her Mahrams (non-marriageable kin).\nAllah, the Exalted, has chosen the attire for the Muslim man and woman in prayer, such that it is in a form of complete adornment and dignity, as Allah loves from His servant and female servant.\nThis choice for the prayer indicates that Allah loves the Hijab for women, even when she is alone before Him, the Exalted, unseen by anyone, and that it is not a ruling related only to the gaze of men, but rather it is attire that Allah loves, to the extent that He chose it for a woman to wear when standing before Allah.\nThe distinction between the two types of clothing here, where a woman covers her head and a man is not required to do so, is also an extension of the natural difference between men and women. The attribute of modesty in a man differs from that in a woman, due to the difference in their nature and creation. A woman is created with adornment, having a nature that differs in her attractiveness and allure from that of a man. Therefore, Shari`ah has distinguished between men and women in clothing, in going out with perfume, and in the requirement of a Mahram for travel, all of which are differences arising from the difference in creation, and Shari`ah\'s concern for the protection of women in a manner that corresponds with the attention she attracts, and the potential danger that such attention may bring to her. In addition to what we have already mentioned, the Hijab itself is something that Allah loves and sees in it modesty and dignity that befit a Muslim woman to exhibit before Him, the Exalted, and this is not required of a man due to the difference in his nature and creation. The differentiation in rulings, commands, and prohibitions based on the difference in nature and creation is something that sound reason supports, and people often practice in their worldly affairs and social lives. The true religion has established and practiced it.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/307344/why-women-are-required-to-cover-their-heads-in-salah-and-men-arent
145601,"Is it permissible for a woman to go to the Haram by herself and do tawaf by herself, going from the hotel that is ten minutes away from the Haram? Is it permissible for a woman to go to Makkah by herself and do tawaf by herself, going from the hotel in which she is staying and which is ten minutes away from the Haram? Is it also permissible for her to go with a group of people, both men and women, to stone the Jamarat without any Mahram, and to do tawaf Al-ifadah without a Mahram?","['Praise be to Allah.It is permissible for a woman, if she is in Makkah, to go walking from the hotel to the Haram without a Mahram , and to do Tawaf likewise, because it is only necessary to have a Mahram for travelling ; inside the city it is not essential to have a Mahram. Rather what is stipulated is that a woman should feel safe in going out and not to wear adornment or make-up when she\xa0 goes out.\xa0\nThe same may also be said concerning her going to stone the Jamarat. She may go there without a Mahram; she may go on her own or with a group of women.\xa0\nIf a woman is in one city and wants to go somewhere in a taxi, it is stipulated that she should not be alone with the driver ; if there is a righteous woman with her, then she is not alone with him.\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“With regard to Khulwah (being alone with a member of the opposite sex) inside the city, it is not permissible for a woman to be alone with the driver in a car, even for a short distance, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “No man should be alone with a woman without a Mahram being present.” But if there is another woman with her and the driver is trustworthy, then there is no Khulwah and there is nothing wrong with her and the other woman travelling in the car, so long as their trip is not regarded as “travel.” In this case, we may say that there is no Khulwah because of the other woman who is present. But we cannot say that the woman who accompanies her is regarded as a Mahram; rather we say that what is forbidden inside the city is a man being alone with a woman, unlike travel, in which case it is forbidden for a woman to travel alone without a Mahram. The difference between these two matters is clear.” (Majmu` Fatawa Ibn `Uthaymin, 21/191)\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/145601/can-women-do-tawaf-without-a-mahram
3009,What is the ruling on using prayer beads?,"['Praise be to Allah.Some scholars say that it is permissible to use the Masbahah (prayer beads), but they say that it is preferable to do Tasbih (count praises) on one’s fingers; others say that it is Bid`ah (reprehensible religious innovation).\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Fatawa (22/187):\xa0\n“Some of them might show off by putting their prayer-mats over their shoulders and carrying their Masbahah in their hands, making them symbols of religion and prayer. It is known from the Mutawatir reports (reports in such large numbers that they couldn’t be forged) that neither the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) nor his Companions used these as symbols. They used to recite Tasbih and count on their fingers, as the Hadith says: “Count on your fingers, for they will be asked, and will be made to speak.” Some of them may count their Tasbih with pebbles or date stones. Some people say that doing Tasbih with the Masbahah is disliked, and some allow it, but no one says that Tasbih with the Masbahah is better than Tasbih with the fingers.” Then he (may Allah have mercy on him) goes on to discuss the issue of showing off with the Masbahah, saying that it is showing off with regard to something that is not prescribed by Islam, which is worse than showing off with regard to something that is prescribed.”\nAl-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Salih Al-`Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked\xa0 (al-Al-Liqa al-Al-MaftoohMaftuh, 3/30) whether using the Masbahah for Tasbih is Bid`ah, and his reply was:\xa0\n“It is better not to do Tasbih with the Masbahah, but it is not Bid`ah , because there is a basis for it, which is the fact that some of the Sahabah (Companions) did Tasbih with pebbles. But the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught us that Tasbih with the fingers is better, as he said, `Count with the fingertips, for they will be made to speak.’ Doing Tasbih with the Masbahah is not haram (impermissible) or Bid`ah, but it is better not to do it, because the one who does Tasbih with the Masbahah has shunned something better. Using the Masbahah may also be contaminated with some element of showing off, because we see some people carrying Masbahah that contain a thousand beads, as if they are telling people, `Look at me, I do a thousand Tasbihs!’ Secondly, those who use the Masbahah for Tasbih are usually absent-minded and not focused, so you see them doing Tasbih with the beads, but their gaze is wandering all over the place, which indicates that they are not really concentrating. It is better to do Tasbih with one’s fingers, preferably using the right hand rather than the left, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to count his Tasbih on his right hand. If a person counts his Tasbih using both hands, there is nothing wrong with that, but it is better to use the right hand only.”\nAsh-Shaykh Muhammad Nasir Al-Din Al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) said in As-Silsilah Ad-Da`ifah (1/110), where he quotes the (inauthentic) Hadith “What a good reminder is the Subhah [Masbahah],”\n“In my view, the meaning of this Hadith is invalid for a number of reasons:\n\nFirstly, the Subhah [Masbahah] is Bid`ah and was not known at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). It happened after that, so how could he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) have encouraged his Sahabah to do something that was unknown to them? The evidence for what I have said is the report narrated by Ibn Waddah in Al-Bid’ wa’l-Nahy `anha from Al-Salt ibn Bahram, who said: `Ibn Mas’ood passed by a woman who had a [Masbahah] with which she was making Tasbih, and he broke it and threw it aside, then he passed by a man who was making Tasbih with pebbles, and he kicked him then said, “You think you are better than the Sahabah, but you are following unjustified Bid`ah! You think you have more knowledge than the Companions of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)!”’ Its chain of narrators is authentic to As-Salt, who is one of the trustworthy followers of the Tabi`in.\nSecondly, it goes against the guidance of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). `Abdulah ibn `Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) said, `I saw the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) counting the Tasbih on his right hand.’”\n\nHe also said (1/117):\xa0\n“If there is only one bad thing about the Masbahah, which is that it takes the place of the Sunnah of counting on the fingers, even though all agree that counting on the fingers is preferable, then that is bad enough. How rarely I see people counting their Tasbih on their fingers!\nMoreover, people have invented so many sophisticated ways of following this Bid`ah, so you see the followers of one of the [Sufi] Tariqahs (orders) wearing the Masbahah around their necks ! Or some of them counting with the beads whilst talking or listening to you! Or another one – the like of whom I have not seen for some time – riding his bicycle through a street crowded with people, with the Masbahah in one of his hands! They are showing the people that they are not distracted from the remembrance of Allah for even an instant, but in many cases this Bid`ah is a cause of their neglecting what is obligatory. It has happened many times – to others as well as myself – that when I greet one of these people with Salam, they answer only by waving and not by saying the words of the greeting. The bad results of this Bid`ah are innumerable, and no one can say it better than the poet:\n`All goodness is in following that which went before (the Salaf)\nAll badness is in the innovations of those who came later.’”\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3009/are-prayer-beads-allowed-in-islam
403949,Does this Hadith apply only to those who visit the sick Muslims to their home?,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nAbu Dawud (3099) and Imam Ahmad in ""Al-Musnad"" (2/47-48), among others, narrated from `Ali, who said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) say: ""When a man visits his Muslim brother, he walks in the harvest of Paradise until he sits down, and when he sits down, mercy envelops him. If it is in the morning, seventy thousand angels will pray for him until the evening, and if it is in the evening, seventy thousand angels will pray for him until the morning.""\nAbu Dawud said after Hadith number (3100): ""This was claimed to be narrated from `Ali, from the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) through unverified chains."" End quote.\nThis Hadith has been narrated with differences among its narrators; some have transmitted it as a statement of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him), and others as a statement of `Ali (may Allah be pleased with him).\nAt-Tirmidhi said after Hadith (969): ""This Hadith has also been narrated from `Ali through other chains, some of which are mawquf (stopped at the Companion) and not raised (to the Prophet)."" End quote.\nThe researchers of Al-Musnad said: ""Authentic as mawquf, its narrators are trustworthy, narrators of both Al-Bukhari and Muslim, but there is a difference of opinion on whether it is mawquf or marfu` (attributed to the Prophet), and the mawquf is more authentic."" End quote.\nAnd if the mawquf is considered more authentic, then it has the ruling of being marfu` (attributed to the Prophet), because such statements are not made based on opinion; they are from the knowledge of the unseen.\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n""An example of a statement that is considered marfu` in ruling, though not explicitly, is when a Companion, who does not take from the Isra\'iliyyat (Judeo-Christian traditions), speaks about matters that do not allow for ijtihad (independent reasoning), and are not related to explaining language or clarifying something obscure, such as narrating past events: from the beginning of creation, stories of the prophets, or future events: like battles, tribulations, and the conditions of the Day of Judgment, as well as narrating about specific rewards or punishments for certain actions. It is considered as marfu` because his narration of such matters implies that he has an informant, and matters that do not allow for ijtihad require someone to have established the statement, and there is no one to establish such statements for the Companions except the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him), or some who narrate from ancient scriptures. Therefore, this precaution is taken to avoid the second category.\nIf that is the case, then it has the ruling of what would be if he said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said, so it is marfu`, whether he heard it directly from him or through an intermediary."" End quote. ""Nuzhat An-Nazar"" (pp. 132-134).\nSecondly:\nThis Hadith encompasses everyone who intends to visit and care for the sick, seeking reward, whether the visitor is a stranger, a relative, a doctor, or a nurse; because actions are judged by intentions, and everyone will have what they intended; as narrated by `Umar ibn Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) say: ""Actions are (judged) by intentions, and everyone will have what they intended. Therefore, whoever\'s migration is for worldly gain or to marry a woman, then his migration will be for what he migrated for."" Narrated by Al-Bukhari (1) and Muslim (1907).\nA single action can sometimes be performed with the intention of two acts of worship or one act of worship and a customary act, and this is a mercy from Allah to this nation.\nShaykh `Abd Ar-Rahman As-Sa`di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n""From the grace and facilitation of Allah is that a single action can stand in place of multiple actions. So, if one enters the mosque at the time of the prescribed prayer and prays two rak`ahs, intending by them both the prescribed prayer and the greeting of the mosque, he will attain the reward for both."" End quote. ""Al-Qawa`id wal-Usul Al-Jami`ah"" (p. 168).\nAn example of this is what was reported in the Hadith of Zaynab, the wife of `Abdullah ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with them both), when she asked the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) while desiring to give charity from her wealth: ""Would it suffice for me to spend on my husband and the orphans under my care?\nHe said: Yes, and she will have two rewards: the reward of kinship and the reward of charity."" Narrated by Al-Bukhari (1466) and Muslim (1000).\nFrom this principle, a doctor or nurse can rightfully perform their required duties with the intention of visiting and helping the sick.\nShaykh `Umar Sulayman Al-Ashqar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n""Those who work in worldly professions among Muslims: doctors, engineers, and researchers, can make their work acts of worship by having a righteous intention when performing these tasks, and this does not oblige them to not seek their worldly benefits from these works."" End quote. ""Maqasid Al-Mukallafin"" (p. 400).\nSuch an intention is among the righteous deeds, leading the doctor and nurse to show kindness to the patients, be patient with them, and not to be annoyed or mistreat them.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/403949/is-the-hadith-authentic
72828,"If I miss Duha prayer after twelve noon, should I make it up even if that it after Dhuhr prayer?.","['Praise be to Allah.The time for Duha prayer\n“The time for Duha prayer is from when the sun has risen to the height of a spear, which is fifteen or twenty minutes after sunrise, until just before the sun passes its zenith (and the zenith is when the time for Dhuhr prayer begins).\xa0\nWhat is meant by just before the sun passes its zenith is ten to fifteen minutes before it reaches the zenith, i.e. before the time when it is forbidden to pray begins.” (Majmu` Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin, 14/306)\xa0\nIbn Muflih (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The time for (Duha) is from when the time when it is forbidden to prays ends, until the sun reaches its zenith. What is meant – and Allah knows best – is just before the sun passes its zenith, because it is forbidden to pray at that time.” (Al-Furu`, 1/5670)\xa0\nShould one make up Duha prayer?\nThe scholars differed with regard to making up Duha prayer if the time had ended. Some of them were of the view that it should be made up, and this is the correct view according to the Shafi`is and some of the Hanbalis. Others were of the view that it should not be made up. This is the old view of Ash-Shafi`i and of the Hanbalis and Malikis.\xa0\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Majmu` (3/532): “Our companions said: Optional prayers are of two types,\xa0\n\none that is not connected to a specific time and is only done for a reason such as eclipses, praying for rain and greeting the mosque. If it is missed, it cannot be made up.\nThe second type is connected to a specific time, such as Eid prayer, Duha and regular Sunnah prayers that are offered with obligatory prayers, such as the Sunnah of Dhuhr etc.\n\nThere are three views concerning these:\n\nThe correct view is that it is recommended to make them up. Al-Qadi Abu’l-Tayyib and others said that this is the view that is stated in the new view (of Ash-Shafa`i).\xa0\nThe second view is that they should not be made up. This was stated in the old view (of Ash-Shafa`i), and it is the view of Abu Hanifah.\xa0\nThe third view is that independent prayers such as Eid and Duha should be made up, whereas prayers that are not independent such as the regular Sunnah prayers that are offered with obligatory prayers should not be made up. If they are made up then the correct view is that they should always be made up. Some of our companions narrated an inauthentic view which is that missed prayers of the day may be made up so long as the sun has not set and missed prayers of the night may be made up so long as the sun has not risen. Based on this, the Sunnah of Fajr may be made up so long as it is still day… This is all inauthentic and the correct view is that it is recommended to make up all prayers at all times. The evidence for that is the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him):\xa0 “Whoever sleeps and misses a prayer or forgets it, let him pray it when he remembers it.” And Abu Qatadah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) missed Fajr prayer whilst travelling, until the sun had risen. So he did Wudu’ then he prayed two Rak`ahs, then the iqamah was given and he prayed Fajr prayer. What is meant by two Rak`ahs here is the regular Sunnah prayer that comes before Fajr. And Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prayed two Rak`ahs after ‘Asr and she asked him about that. He said: “Some people from ‘Abd Al-Qays came to me with the news that their people had become Muslim and they distracted me from the two Rak`ahs that come after Dhuhr, so I did these two Rak`ahs after ‘Asr.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim). And Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever did not pray two Rak`ahs of Fajr until the sun rose, let him pray them (now).” Narrated by Al-Bayhaqi with a jayyid isnad. And it was narrated from Abu Sa`id (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever slept and missed Witr, or forgot it, let him pray it when he remembers.” Narrated by Abu Dawud with a sound chain of narrators. And it was narrated from `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that if the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) missed praying at night because of pain or anything else, he would pray twelve Rak`ahs during the day. Narrated by Muslim. There are many other Hadiths about this matter, apart from those which we have mentioned, but this is sufficient. And Allah is the Source of strength.”\n\nAl-Mardawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Insaf (2/191): “Shaykh `Abd Al-Qadir said: He may do it after the sun has passed its zenith, but if he delays it until he has prayed Dhuhr, he may make it up.”\nThe Hanafis stated that if the Sunnah prayers are missed, none of them should be made up except the Sunnah of Fajr, which should be made up if it is missed along with the obligatory prayer, and it may be made up until the sun reaches its zenith. (Al-Fatawa Al-Hindiyyah, 1/112)\xa0\nThis is also the view of the Malikis. In their view no optional prayer should be made up except the two Rak`ahs of Fajr, which may be made up until the sun reaches the zenith, whether the obligatory Fajr prayer was offered alongside it or not. (Bulghat As-Salik, 1/408)\xa0(See also Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah Al-Kuwaitiyyah, 34/37)\xa0\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) favoured the view that Duha prayer should not be made up if the time for it has ended. He was asked: If the Sunnah prayer of Duha is missed, should it be made up or not? \xa0\nHe replied:\xa0\n“If the time for Duha prayer is missed, then the prayer has been missed, because it is limited to that time. But with regard to the regular Sunnah prayers , because they are connected to the obligatory prayers, they may be made up alongside them. The same also applies to Witr, because it is proven in the Sunnah that if the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) slept or was ill at night he would pray twelve rak`ahs during the day. And Witr may also be made up .”\xa0 (Majmu` Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin, 14/305)\xa0\nThe matter is broad in scope, praise be to Allah.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/72828/should-one-make-up-duha-prayer
