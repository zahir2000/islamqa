319879,"I am a young, religiously-committed man, and I pray for forgiveness constantly, praise be to Allah. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says in His Book (interpretation of the meaning):","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt is proven in the religious texts that praying for forgiveness is a means of having a good life in this world, and a means of being provided with wealth and children, and the means of having rain.\nAllah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{[Through a messenger, saying], ‘Do not worship except Allah . Indeed, I am to you from Him a warner and a bringer of good tidings,’\nAnd [saying], ‘Seek forgiveness of your Lord and repent to Him, [and] He will let you enjoy a good provision for a specified term and give every doer of favor his favor. But if you turn away, then indeed, I fear for you the punishment of a great Day’}\xa0[Hud 11:2-3].\nThe commentator Shaykh Muhammad al-Amin ash-Shinqiti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThis verse indicates that praying for forgiveness and repenting to Allah, may He be exalted, from sin are a means of Allah granting to the one who does that enjoyment of good provision for a specified term, because He has made that the consequences of praying for forgiveness and repenting, as a reward for meeting that condition.\nWhat appears to be the case is that what is meant by enjoyment of good provision is abundant provision, a life of comfort and well-being in this world, and that what is meant by the specified term is death. This is indicated by what Allah, may He be exalted, tells us in this surah about the words of His Prophet Hud (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him and upon our Prophet):\n{And O my people, ask forgiveness of your Lord and then repent to Him. He will send [rain from] the sky upon you in showers and increase you in strength [added] to your strength}\xa0[Hud 11:52].\nAnd He, may He be exalted, tells us about Nuh:\n{And said, ‘Ask forgiveness of your Lord. Indeed, He is ever a Perpetual Forgiver.\nHe will send [rain from] the sky upon you in [continuing] showers,\nAnd give you increase in wealth and children and provide for you gardens and provide for you rivers}\xa0[Nuh 71:10-12].\nAnd He, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Whoever does righteousness, whether male or female, while he is a believer - We will surely cause him to live a good life…}\xa0[an-Nahl 16:97]\n{And if only the people of the cities had believed and feared Allah , We would have opened upon them blessings from the heaven and the earth}\xa0[al-A ‘raf 7:96]\n{And if only they upheld [the law of] the Torah, the Gospel, and what has been revealed to them from their Lord, they would have consumed [provision] from above them and from beneath their feet.}\xa0[al-Ma’idah 5:66]\n{And whoever fears Allah - He will make for him a way out,\nAnd will provide for him from where he does not expect}\xa0[at-Talaq 66:2-3].\nAnd there are many similar verses.""(Adwa’ al-Bayan\xa0 3/11-12).\nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 39775 .\nSecondly:\nIf a child or rain is a long time in coming for the one who is praying for forgiveness, it is not appropriate for him to think negatively of his Lord, may He be exalted. Rather he must reflect and think negatively of his own self, for perhaps he is praying for forgiveness without proper focus and humility, or is merely paying lip service to praying for forgiveness, and this is an obstacle to his prayer for forgiveness being answered.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Call upon your Lord in humility and privately; indeed, He does not like transgressors.\nAnd cause not corruption upon the earth after its reformation. And invoke Him in fear and aspiration. Indeed, the mercy of Allah is near to the doers of good}\xa0[al-A‘raf 7:55-56].\nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said: “Call upon Allah in supplication when you are certain of a response, and understand that Allah will not answer the supplication of one whose heart is distracted and heedless.”\nNarrated by at-Tirmidhi (3479); classed as hasan by Shaykh al-Albani in Sahih at-Targhib wa’t-Tarhib (2/286).\nOr perhaps the one who is praying for forgiveness has some sins of which he is heedless, and has not repented from them or sought Allah’s forgiveness for them.\nMoreover, part of the Muslim’s creed is to believe that Allah, may He be exalted, is perfect in His justice, so He does not wrong a person by taking away even an atom’s weight of the good that he has done. He is also perfect in His wisdom, therefore the one who is seeking forgiveness should think positively of his Lord, and not object to His wisdom.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{He cannot be questioned about what He does, but they will be questioned}\xa0[al-Anbiya’ 21:23].\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nHe, may He be glorified, is the Creator, Lord and Sovereign of all things, and He has great wisdom in what He creates; from Him come all the blessings we enjoy and His mercy encompasses all in general, whilst He singles out some for special mercy. He is not to be questioned about what He does, but they will be questioned. This is not only because of His might and power, but because of the perfect nature of His knowledge, His might, His mercy and His wisdom.""(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa\xa0 8/79).\nPerhaps the delay in the arrival of a child or rain is something good for a person; perhaps keeping him on the straight path requires depriving him of some worldly conveniences.\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhat is contrary to rida (contentment with Allah’s decree) is insisting that He do something, believing that He should give you what you are asking Him for and what you want, when you do not know whether that is pleasing to Him or not. This is like one who insists that his Lord should give him such and such a position of authority, or make him rich, or meet his need. This is contrary to contentment with His decree, because he cannot be certain that this is something with which the Lord is pleased.""(Madarij as-Salikin\xa0 3/2033).\nIbn al-Jawzi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe wise person should be content if what he asks for in his supplication is not granted, for if he offers supplication and asks for what he is seeking, then this supplication is an act of worship to Allah. Then if he is granted what he sought, he should give thanks, and if he is not granted what he wants, he should not persist in pursuing it, because this world is not for the purpose of getting what we want. He should say to himself: {But perhaps you hate a thing and it is good for you; and perhaps you love a thing and it is bad for you} [al-Baqarah 2:216].""(Sayd al-Khatir\xa0 p. 625-626).\nMoreover, the supplication of the Muslim is all good. If he is not granted what he asked for in this world, perhaps something bad of which he is not aware may be warded off from him, or perhaps it will be stored up for him until the Day of Resurrection. So he should praise Allah for that.\nIt was narrated from ‘Ubadah ibn as-Samit (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no Muslim on earth who offers supplication to Allah but either Allah will grant it to him, or He will ward off an equivalent harm from him, unless he offers supplication for the purpose of sin or severing ties of kinship.” One man said: Then we should offer a great deal of supplication. He said: “Then Allah will grant you more.” Narrated by at-Tirmidhi (3573), who said: This is a hasan sahih gharib hadith with this isnad.\nAnd it was narrated from Abu Sa ‘id that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no Muslim who offers a supplication in which there is no sin or severing of ties of kinship but Allah will give him one of three things in return for it: either He will hasten to grant him what he asked for, or He will store it up for him in the hereafter, or he will avert from him and equivalent harm.” They said: Then we should offer a great deal of supplication. He said: “Then Allah will grant you more.” Narrated by Imam Ahmad in al-Musnad (17/213). Shaykh al-Albani said: It is hasan sahih, as noted in Sahih at-Targhib wa’t-Tarhib (2/278).\nFor more information, please see the answers to questions no. 229456 and 5113 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/319879/he-constantly-prays-for-forgiveness-but-he-has-not-been-blessed-with-a-child-and-no-rain-has-fallen
296390,"I am a university student, and I want to earn halal wealth, so I can spend on myself and help my family with it as much as I can. The only obstacle to my finding a way of earning a living is my submissive and obsequious attitude towards many people, including my boss at work. My question is: isn’t showing submissiveness to anyone other than Allah a sin? Doesn’t that make wealth earned this way haram? How can I rid myself of this submissiveness and obsequiousness with the boss in particular and with people in general? I don’t mind if you advise me to read a book on this topic, as I love reading.","['Praise be to Allah.The basic principle with regard to taking up jobs and occupations is that they are permissible, and nothing is a sin, unless there is clear evidence that it is prohibited.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nPeople’s words and actions are of two types: acts of worship, by means of which they have sound commitment to their religion, and regular daily activities that they need in their worldly affairs.\nBy examining the basic principles of Islam, we realise that the acts of worship which Allah has enjoined or that He loves cannot be proven to be enjoined except on the basis of religious texts…\nRegular daily activities are permissible in principle, so none of them are to be prohibited except what Allah has prohibited, otherwise we will be included in the verse (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Say, “Have you seen what Allah has sent down to you of provision of which you have made [some] lawful and [some] unlawful?”}\xa0[Yunus 10:59].\nHence Allah condemned the polytheists who prescribed matters of religion for which Allah did not give permission, and they prohibited things that Allah did not prohibit… This is an important and beneficial principle.""(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa\xa0 29/16-18).\nWhat is causing you confusion as a result of feeling inferior and submissive is because this type of feeling usually occurs as a result of four things when people interact with one another.\n1. Humility\nHumility is prescribed for Muslims in general, and is encouraged in Islamic teachings.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{O you who have believed, whoever of you should revert from his religion - Allah will bring forth [in place of them] a people He will love and who will love Him [who are] humble toward the believers, powerful against the disbelievers; they strive in the cause of Allah and do not fear the blame of a critic. That is the favor of Allah; He bestows it upon whom He wills. And Allah is all-Encompassing and Knowing}\xa0[al-Ma’idah 5:54].\nHumility is a kind of mercy and being easy-going when interacting with others, and not looking down on them or being arrogant, as is explained in a different verse, in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah ; and those with him are forceful against the disbelievers, merciful among themselves}\xa0[al-Fath 48:29].\nIt was narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Shall I not tell you of one who will be forbidden to the Fire, or one to whom the Fire will be forbidden: every approachable, gentle, easy-going person.”\nNarrated by at-Tirmidhi (2488); he said: This is a hasan gharib hadith. It was classed as sahih by al-Albani in as-Silsilah as-Sahihah (2/611).\n2. Fear\nThe worker’s fear of the boss that he may dismiss him from his job or deduct \xa0something from his salary is usually a kind of fear of people regarding that in which Allah has granted them power. This is not haram and is not a sin, but it is falling short in putting one’s trust in Allah (tawakkul) in the true meaning of the word.\nPlease see the answer to question no. 191525 .\n3. Shyness\nShyness (haya’) in dealing with people is part of faith.\nIt was narrated from ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) passed by a man of the Ansar who was exhorting his brother regarding shyness. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Let him be, for shyness is part of faith.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (24) and Muslim (36).\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: What is meant by “exhorting his brother regarding shyness” is that he was telling him not to be shy, and telling him that shyness was bad and rebuking him for being too shy. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) told him not to do that, and said: “Let him be, for shyness is part of faith” – in other words, let him be shy and stop telling him not to be like that.""(Sharh Sahih Muslim\xa0 2/6).\n4. Obedience\nObedience to your boss regarding what you committed yourself to do in the contract between you and him is something obligatory.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{O you who have believed, fulfill [all] contracts}\xa0[al-Ma’idah 5:1].\nWith regard to obeying your boss when he asks you to do something that is in the interests of the work, but is not included in the contract, if it is minor and does not harm the worker, then doing that is recommended.\nIt was narrated from Jaabir ibn ‘Abdillah (may Allah be pleased with them both) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “May Allah have mercy on a man who is easy-going when he sells, when he buys, and when he asks for payment.”\xa0Narrated by al-Bukhari (2076).\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThis is encouragement to be easy-going when dealing with people, and to be well mannered, with a sublime attitude, and not to be strict.""(Fath al-Bari\xa0 4/307).\nTo sum up: if the Muslim interacts with his boss or with other people in these ways, he will be fine or will be rewarded.\nBut that is subject to the condition that good manners and a good attitude when dealing with people does not lead to keeping quiet about or approving of haram actions, or helping others in doing them, or doing them oneself.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And cooperate in righteousness and piety, but do not cooperate in sin and transgression. And fear Allah; indeed, Allah is severe in penalty}\xa0[al-Ma’idah 5:2].\nThere can be no humility, shyness or obedience when it comes to haram matters.\nIt was narrated from ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no obedience if it involves disobedience [to Allah]; rather obedience is only in that which is right and proper.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (7257) and Muslim (1840). It was also narrated by Imam Ahmad in al-Musnad (2/318) as: “There is no obedience to any human if it involves disobedience to Allah.”\nJust being afraid of your boss at work is not an excuse for committing haram actions.\nRather what you must do if you see haram actions being committed is to denounce them to the best of your ability and as much as will achieve the goal of removing them, in compliance with the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “Whoever among you sees an evil action, let him change it with his hand (by taking action); if he cannot, then with his tongue (by speaking out); and if he cannot, then with his heart (by hating it and feeling it is wrong), and that is the weakest of faith.” Narrated by Muslim (49).\nYou should also be cautious and ensure that your good attitude in dealing with people does not lead to you allowing others to humiliate you, for it is not the way of the believer to put himself in a humiliating position.\nIbrahim an-Nakha‘i said: They – meaning the early generations (salaf) – hated to be humiliated by others, but when they had the power to retaliate, they would forgive. Mentioned in a mu‘allaq report by al-Bukhari in as-Sahih. Fath al-Bari (5/99).\nConclusion: if you are doing permissible work, and not helping in any sin or approving of it, and not putting yourself in a humiliating position, then there is nothing wrong with your work. Your feelings of being inferior or submissive to the boss may be intrusive thoughts from the Shaytan, aimed at discouraging you from doing that which is beneficial for you. The way to deal with that is to seek Allah’s help and focus on what you find beneficial in your permissible work.\nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The strong believer is better and more beloved to Allah than the weak believer, although both are good. Strive to do that which will benefit you and seek the help of Allah, and do not feel helpless.” Narrated by Muslim (2664).\nIf your issue has to do with extreme shyness, we advise you to read the book Fiqh al-Haya’ by Shaykh Muhammad Isma‘il al-Muqaddam.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/296390/ruling-on-showing-humility-to-the-boss-at-work
