394458,"What is the ruling on celebrating separation by khul‘ from a bad husband, to have some joy after going through a bad time?","['Praise be to Allah.Separation of spouses is something that the Shaytan loves and is keen to make happen.\nMuslim (5023) narrated that Jabir said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Iblis placed his throne on water then he sends out his emissaries, and the closest of them to him in status is the one who causes the most fitnah (trouble). One of them comes and says, ‘I did such and such,’ and he says, ‘You have not done much.’ Then another of them comes and says, ‘I did not leave him alone until I caused division between him and his wife,’ and he draws him close to him and says, ‘How good you are.’”\nAl-Nawawi said in Sharh Sahih Muslim:\nRegarding the words “and he draws him close to him and says, ‘How good you are’”, he praises him because he is impressed with what he did, and he achieved the goal that he wanted. End quote.\nAbu Dawud (2178) narrated that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The most hateful of permissible things to Allah is divorce,” The isnad of this hadith is da‘if (weak), but its meaning is sound, as has been explained previously in the answer to question no. 120761 .\nIf that is the case, then how can a Muslim celebrate the occurrence of something that Allah, may He be exalted, hates and that the Shaytan is pleased with and encourages?\nThat is in addition to what may happen in such a celebration of evils and objectionable matters, such as free mixing between men and women, wanton display of beauty (tabarruj), temptation (fitnah), music and singing.\nMoreover, this celebration is offensive to the husband and closes the door to any possibility of the spouses coming back together, because if the husband finds out that his wife has held a celebration when the khul‘ took place, it is unlikely that he will think of going back to her.\nConclusion: what appears to be the case is that this kind of innovated celebration and unacceptable custom is not allowed. The marriage contract is something sacred, and there are rules and etiquette to be observed when it is to be dissolved. In fact, the husband has rights, even after separation, and it is for this reason that ‘iddah has been prescribed.\nIf the husband is abusive towards the wife, and she cannot find any way to free herself from his abuse except by means of khul‘, and she manages to do that, then it is sufficient for her to say “Al-hamdu Lillah” and praise Allah, may He be exalted, for having saved her from this abuser, without celebrating and showing excessive joy.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/394458/is-it-permissible-to-celebrate-separation-by-khul-or-talaq-from-an-abusive-husband
150579,"I have a little knowledge about Murabahah transactions, and I hope that you can explain it in a way that will help us to avoid anything prohibited.","['Praise be to Allah.How does Murabahah work in Islamic banks?\n\nIn a Murabahah transaction, you typically enter into an agreement with a company or bank to buy specific items, such as a car or building materials, with a promise to the company that when it buys the products and takes possession of them, you will buy products from them with a certain profit margin.\xa0\nThis Murabahah is not a loan , and calling this transaction a loan is wrong, unless the so-called Murabahah transaction is incorrect and the company did not buy the product for itself, rather all it did was finance the customer by giving him the money. In that case it is a loan; in fact it is a Riba-based loan because the company is asking the customer to pay back the loan plus an added amount.\xa0\nWhat are the conditions of a valid Murabahah?\nThe correct form of Murabahah involves the following steps:\xa0\n\n\nOne tells the company about the products that you want to acquire.\n\n\nThe company buys these products for itself.\n\n\nThe company takes possession of the products and moves them from the dealer’s place. It is not permissible for it to sell the products to the customer before taking possession of them and moving them.\n\n\nThe company sells the products to the customer after taking possession of them.\n\n\nOnce the company has sold the products to you, it is permissible for you to use them to build the house, or to sell them in the marketplace in order to obtain cash, so long as you sell them to someone who has no connection to the company or the dealer who sold them to the company. It is also stipulated that you should sell them yourself, and it is not permissible for you to delegate the company to sell them for you.\xa0\n\n\nIf these conditions are met, then the Murabahah is valid.\xa0\nThe evidence that the company is obliged to take possession of the products and move them from the dealer’s place is the report narrated by Ahmad (15399) and An-Nasa’i (4613), according to which Hakeem ibn Hizaam (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I said: O Messenger of Allah, I buy and sell things; what is permissible for me with regard to them and what is forbidden? He said: “When you have bought something, do not sell it until you have taken possession of it.” (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Al-Jami‘, no. 342)\xa0\nAd-Daraqutni and Abu Dawud (3499) narrated from Zayd ibn Thabit (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade selling goods in the same place where they were bought, before the merchants moves them to their places. (Classed as authentic by Ibn Hiban and Al-Hakim; classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud.)\xa0\nIbn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever buys some foodstuff, let him not sell it until he has received it in full.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari (2132) and Muslim (1525), who added: Ibn ‘Abbas said: I think that all things are like this, i.e., there is no difference between foodstuffs and other things in that regard.)\xa0\nConnection between the customer and the dealer\nThere is no connection between you and the dealer who sells the construction material, so you do not have the right to ask him to keep the money until prices drop, because the valid Murabahah transaction – as stated above – is the transaction in which the company must buy from the dealer. When the company has bought the products and taken possession of them, then it is your turn, which means that you buy them from the company. If the price of the materials is too high, then you can wait until prices drop, and then apply for the Murabahah deal.\xa0\nFor more details, please see these answers: 81967 and 13479 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/150579/conditions-of-murabahah
474431,"Is it permissible to give money to a number of people, approximately fifty, and give each one eight or ten cents in return for registering on some websites by email, whilst making sure that there is nothing Islamically objectionable on the website, and no scam or depositing money, and it is simply a survey website, or a platform for communications, and the website assigns some profit for me of approximately thirty cents for every person who registers through the link that I send to him, therefore I will have knowledge of how much profit I am going to get?","['Praise be to Allah.If what is meant is that the website will give you thirty cents if someone registers with them through your link, and in order to encourage people to register with the website through you, you say to them: Whoever registers through me and participates in a survey, I will give him eight cents or ten cents, then the answer is:\n1. With regard to yourself, if you get others to register with the website for free, and you are given that amount of money for anyone who registers through you, then there does not seem to be anything wrong with it, except for what we will mention below, at the end of the answer.\n2. With regard to the people you recruit, if the work expected of them is permissible – which is filling out a survey, checking the website or merely registering – and the payment is definitely known, whether it is eight cents or ten cents, and is not merely possible, and they can register with the website for free, then there is nothing wrong with that either.\nThe problem that may be there is if the website deceives investors, advertisers and the like, by showing them how many visitors, browsers and subscribers there are, to make them think that these people like the product, for example. In that case it is haram to work with this website, if it becomes clear that it is deceiving people, because in that case registering with it is helping in deception.\nIf what the question means is something other than what we have mentioned, then we hope you will explain it further, so that we can give an answer.\nFor the benefit of readers, we will list some guidelines on when it is permissible to earn money through websites, which are as follows:\n1. Registration with the website should be free.\n2. The content of the website, ads and otherwise, should be permissible.\n3. The work that is to be done should be known, such as clicking on ads, or completing a survey, in which case it is stipulated that you should answer truthfully.\n4. The commission should be known.\n5. The website should not be one that deceives investors, advertisers and the like about the number of visitors and browsers. If that is the case, it is haram to work with it, because that is helping in deceit.\n6.

127946,"I have a problem that is causing me to think a great deal and is making me frustrated. Approximately two months ago, I was able to do well in my exams to become a secondary school teacher, and now I am studying in a school that prepares teachers who specialise in English. I am studying in a mixed class composed of fifteen male students and fifteen female students. After that I will be appointed to teach in one of the secondary schools in my country. This secondary school is also mixed. What frustrates me in fact is that I know that mixing is forbidden, and that men are commanded to lower their gaze. But I tell myself that our country is not like other Muslim countries; moreover people who are religiously committed and righteous have to compete to attain these positions so as to bar the way to those who promote innovation and sin. Now I do not know whether I will be rewarded for what I am doing, or whether the Shaytan is making this action fair-seeming to me and making me think that I am keen to spread the Da`wah and benefit the Muslims by guiding them to correct belief and the sound path. I am convinced that it is not permissible for a non-Mahram man to teach women without a barrier, but isn’t my work necessary, because the secularists, Sufis and others are in control of most fields in our country?","['Praise be to Allah.The prohibition of free mixing between men and women\nOne of the problems with which many Muslims are faced nowadays is the prevalence of free mixing in universities, hospitals , most public facilities and government workplaces.\xa0\nWe have previously explained the prohibition on free mixing and the negative consequences that result from it, in the answer to question no.\xa01200 , where we stated that it is obligatory for the Muslim to avoid studying and working in mixed environments.\xa0\nStudy or teaching in mixed schools\nBut in the countries where the people are faced with the problem of mixing in most fields of life , especially educational centres and workplaces , to the extent that it has become extremely difficult for the Muslim to protect himself from that, a concession is granted to them that is not granted to others whom Allah has protected from such problems.\xa0\nThis concession is based on a principle of Fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) that “whatever is prohibited so as to bar the means that may lead to evil may be permitted in cases of necessity and where doing so serves a greater interest.”\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“All Islamic rulings are based on the principle that some evil which is ordinarily prohibited becomes permissible if there is an urgent need that outweighs."" (Majmu` Al-Fatawa 29/49)\xa0\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) also said:\xa0\n“With regard to that which comes under the heading of barring the means (that lead to something prohibited), it is only to be prohibited if there is no need for it. However, if there is a need for it in order to achieve a purpose that cannot be achieved otherwise, then it is not to be prohibited."" (Majmu` Al-Fatawa\xa0 23/214)\xa0\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“That which is prohibited so as to bar the means (that lead to something prohibited) may be permitted if there is a clear benefit to be achieved, for example: … Nafl prayers that are offered for a specific reason are permissible after Fajr and ‘Asr (when Nafl prayers that are not done for a specific reason are not allowed, until after sunrise and sunset respectively); it is permissible for one who wants to propose for marriage, one who is giving a testimony, a doctor and one who is party to a transaction, buying or selling, to look at a woman’s face in a manner that is ordinarily prohibited; and the prohibition on gold and silk for men is a prohibition that serves to bar the means that may lead to men imitating women, for which the one who does that is cursed, but it is permitted in cases of necessity."" (I`lam Al-Muwaqqi`in\xa0 2/161)\xa0\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“With regard to that which is prohibited in the sense of prohibiting the means (that may lead to something prohibited), it may be permitted in the case of necessity."" (Manthumat Usul Al-Fiqh\xa0 p. 67)\xa0\nWhat appears to be the case, and Allah knows best, is that in such countries where this problem (free mixing) is widespread, a concession may be granted allowing the people to study and work in mixed environments, such as is not granted to others, as stated above.\xa0\nConditions of studying or working in mixed schools\nNonetheless, the following are some conditions that have be met:\xa0\n\nOne should first of all strive hard to look for a place in which there is no mixing, as much as possible.\xa0\n\n\nOne should adhere to the Islamic rulings such as lowering the gaze, and not talking and engaging in conversation more than is necessary for the purpose of work or study.\xa0\n\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about a young man who cannot find anything but a school that is mixed. He said:\xa0\n“You have to look for a school that is not like this, but if you cannot find such a school, and you need to study, then you may read and study, and try to the best of your ability to keep away from immorality and temptation, by lowering your gaze, guarding your tongue, not talking to women and not walking past them."" (Fatawa Nur `Ala Ad-Darb\xa0 1/103, 13/127)\xa0\n\nIf one notices in himself an inclination towards that which is prohibited, and realises that he is being tempted by some of the women who are with him, then preserving his religious commitment takes precedence over all other benefits. In that case, it becomes essential for him to leave that place, and Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, will make him independent of means by His bounty.\xa0\n\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/127946/studying-or-teaching-in-mixed-schools
