223721,"Is the reward multiplied if there are multiple intentions for the same action, such as if a person prays two Sunnah Rak`ahs of Fajr, intending thereby to seek the reward for that and the reward for the Sunnah prayer following Wudu and the reward for “greeting the mosque” (Tahiyyat Al-masjid)?","['Praise be to Allah.Yes, the reward may be multiplied if there are multiple intentions for a single deed. If the Muslim enters the mosque having done Wudu, then prays two rak`ahs intending them as the Sunnah prayer of Fajr , the Sunnah prayer following Wudu and the Sunnah prayer of greeting the mosque , he will attain the reward of what he intended, and Allah is the bestower of great bounty.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“If a person starts to pray, intending it as both the obligatory prayer and the prayer to greet the mosque, his prayer is valid and he will attain the reward of both the obligatory prayer and greeting the mosque."" (Al-Majmu`\xa0 1/325)\nAl-Ghazali (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Ihya’ `Ulum Ad-Din (4/370-371):\n“Acts of obedience and worship are connected to their intentions, as far as their soundness is concerned and as far as their multiple reward is concerned .\nWith regard to soundness, it means that he intends by doing this action to worship Allah, may He be Exalted, and nothing else; if he intends to show off, then his action becomes a sin.\nWith regard to multiple reward , that is connected to the number of good intentions. By doing one act of obedience and worship, it is possible to intend many good things thereby, and he will have a reward for each intention. That is because for each of these intentions he will have a reward, and each reward will be multiplied tenfold, as is mentioned in the Hadith.\xa0\nFor example, sitting in the mosque is an act of worship, and a person may have several intentions when doing that, so that it becomes like one of the good deeds of the pious, and he attains thereby the level of those who are close to Allah.\nWhilst sitting in the mosque, he may do the following:\n\nBelieving that (the mosque) is the House of Allah, and that the one who enters it is visiting his Lord, so he intends thereby to visit his Lord in the hope of what the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) promised when he said: “Whoever sits in the mosque has visited Allah, may He be Exalted, and it is incumbent upon the one who is visited to honour his visitor.”\nWaiting for one prayer after another.\nSpending some time in devotion, by restraining his hearing, sight and physical faculties from moving and wandering, for I`tikaf is restraint and it is akin to fasting, which is a type of devotion.\nFocusing one’s thoughts on Allah and reflecting upon the hereafter, and warding off everything that may distract him from that by staying in the mosque.\nFocusing on remembering Allah, or listening to that which will remind him of Allah.\nIntending to benefit others with his knowledge by enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong, because in the mosque there are bound to be people who pray badly or engage in activities that are not permissible in the mosque.\nGetting to know brothers in faith.\nRefraining from sins out of shyness before Allah, may He be Exalted, and out of shyness lest one do in the house of Allah that which is a transgression against its sanctity.\n\nThis is a way to increase the number of intentions, and you can extend this by analogy to all other acts of worship and permissible actions, because there is no act of obedience and worship that cannot have several intentions. The believer may bring to mind intentions commensurate with his eagerness to do good and his efforts to do that. Thus, his deeds will grow and his rewards for good deeds will multiply .”\xa0\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“A person may do Wudu and pray two Rak`ahs, intending them to be the Sunnah prayer following Wudu, but if he enters the mosque after doing Wudu and prays two Rak`ahs, intending them to be greeting the mosque and the Sunnah prayer following Wudu, he will attain two rewards: the reward of the Sunnah prayer following Wudu and the reward of greeting the mosque. Praise be to Allah, the bounty of Allah is immense. If he prays with the intention of offering the regular Sunnah prayer of Dhuhr, meaning that he does Wudu, enters the mosque, and intends the Sunnah prayer of Dhuhr , the Sunnah prayer following Wudu and the Sunnah prayer of greeting the mosque, he will attain the reward of all of that, praise be to Allah.""

467630,"I am an agricultural engineer in the animal reproduction department. For a while I have been working in the field of artificial insemination for animals (cattle, buffalo), and also importing animal sperm for some engineers and veterinarians who work in the same field.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt is permissible to sell the semen of animals whose meat may be eaten, for the purpose of insemination, because it is pure (tahir) according to the correct view, and has beneficial uses, and it is possible to deliver it. Therefore it is a product which has value, so it is permissible to sell it like anything else that it is permissible to sell.\nShaykh ‘Abd al-Rahman al-Jibrin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: As for selling the semen to horse owners, that may be permissible if it is beneficial and gives results, and the aim is to increase the number of high quality horses. But the value of it should be within normal limits, without going to extremes in raising the value of this semen, because it does not cost its owners much, and they do not lose anything if it is wasted. End quote from the shaykh’s website.\nShaykh Muhammad al-Mukhtar al-Shinqiti said: With regard to the words “its semen and human semen”, what is meant by “its semen” is the semen of animals whose meat may be eaten; it is regarded as pure (tahir). Here the author is speaking about animal semen, because there are many different rulings regarding semen.\nFor example, animal semen may be sold, and this is applicable to different types of animals. It is well established according to Islamic teachings, and this is the view of almost all the scholars except the Hanafis, that it is not permissible to sell that which is impure (najis), because of the hadith of Jabir ibn ‘Abdillah: “Allah and His Messenger forbade the selling of dead meat [meat of an animal that was not slaughtered in the prescribed manner], alcohol, pork and idols.”\xa0 As it is proven that it is not permissible to sell what is impure, and it has been established that the semen that is emitted by an animal whose meat may be eaten is pure, then in this case, if someone were to ask you about selling the semen of animals, which is sold in syringes and injected into the females so that they will conceive and produce young, and whether it is permissible or not,\nthen according to the view that what comes out of an animal is impure, it is not permissible to sell it, because it is not permissible to sell what is impure. But according to the view that it is pure, it is permissible to sell it, because it is pure like any other pure item.""(Sharh Zad al-Mustaqni‘\xa0 23/10).\nWith regard to the prohibition on stud fees – which means that it is not allowed to charge a fee for an animal mating with another and ejaculating – the jurists gave as a reason for that the fact that the nature and quantity of the water (semen) is not known, and it cannot be delivered; the matter depends on the animal’s desire and ejaculation.\nBased on that, there is nothing wrong with you buying animal semen, then selling it.\nSecondly:\nArtificial insemination is a reproductive technology that is used to inseminate female animals using semen that has been extracted by mechanical means from male animals of good pedigree and high productivity. This is inserted into the female reproductive tract, after artificially inducing ovulation in the female by mechanical, hormonal or other means.\nAfter the sperm is obtained, it goes through several stages, including freezing in order to obtain what is known as an insemination straw, which is placed in a nitrogen solution at minus 96°C, so as to preserve it when it is moved from one place to another.\nWhen the straw is taken out for use, it is placed in hot water to prepare it for insertion in the uterus, using a specially designed syringe.\nThere is nothing wrong with artificially inseminating animals, even if that is done for a fee, and it does not come under the prohibition on stud fees.\nIn the answer to question no. 202324 , we explained that this artificial insemination does not come under the heading of stud fees, which are prohibited.

194080,"Is hunting allowed in Islam? And under what conditions? Hunting is illegal in my country of living, so please tell me if I hunt secretly, is it allowed in Islam or not?","['Praise be to Allah.Is hunting prohibited in Islam?\nThe basic principle concerning hunting land game is that it is permissible, except for one who is in a state of Ihram for Hajj or `Umrah, or is within the boundaries of the Haram zone even if he is not in Ihram.\xa0\nWith regard to fishing and catching other kinds of seafood , it is permissible for the one who is in Ihram and others alike.\xa0\nWhoever hunts permissible animals in order to benefit from them by selling them to earn money, or eating them, giving them as gifts, and so on, there is nothing wrong with that according to scholarly consensus.\xa0\nThe rulings on hunting have to do with the hunter, the prey, and the “tools” used. We will explain this matter in brief.\xa0\nConditions pertaining to the hunter\xa0\nWith regard to the stipulations required of the hunter for his hunting to be acceptable, they are as follows:\xa0\n\nHe should be of sound mind and have reached the age of discernment. This is the view of the majority of jurists (Hanafis, Maalikis and Hanbalis, and it is one view among the Shafi`is).\n\nThat is because a minor who has not reached the age of discernment is not qualified to slaughter an animal, in their view, (and if he does that, it is not regarded as acceptable and the meat is not permissible); by the same token, he is not qualified to hunt. Moreover, hunting requires the intention and invoking the name of Allah, which are not valid if done by one who is not of sound mind, as was explained by the Hanafis and Hanbalis.\xa0\n\nHe should not be in Ihram. If he is in Ihram for Hajj or ‘Umrah, then any game caught by him is not to be eaten; rather it is regarded as “dead meat” (i.e., meat from an animal that was not slaughtered in the prescribed manner).\nIt should be permissible to eat meat slaughtered by him – i.e., he should be a Muslim or one of the People of the Book (Jewish or Christian). It is not permissible to eat game hunted by a polytheist, Magian (Zoroastrian), communist, atheist, apostate and the like.\n\nBased on that, it is not permissible to eat game hunted by one who does not pray altogether , and it is not permissible to eat meat slaughtered by him, because he is a disbeliever and apostate.\n\nIt is stipulated that the hunter must invoke the name of Allah, may He be Exalted, when releasing his hunting animal or shooting. That is according to the majority of Hanafi, Maaliki and Hanbali jurists.\nIt is stipulated that the hunter should intend by releasing his hunting animal or shooting to catch that which it is permissible to hunt. If he releases an arrow or hunting animal against a human being or tame animal, it is not permissible.\n\nConditions pertaining to the prey\nWith regard to the stipulations on the prey, it should be an animal whose flesh may be eaten, i.e., it should be permissible to eat. This is the view of all the jurists, if the hunt is for the purpose of eating.\xa0\nWith regard to hunting in general terms, they differed concerning it.\xa0\nThe Hanafis and Maalikis are of the view that there is no stipulation that the prey should be an animal whose flesh may be eaten; rather in their view it is permissible to hunt both animals whose flesh may be eaten and those whose flesh may not be eaten, for the purpose of obtaining its skin, hair or feathers, or to ward off its evil (i.e., if it is posing a danger to people).\xa0\nWith regard to the Shafi`is and Hanbalis, they do not regard it as permissible to hunt or slaughter any animal whose flesh may not be eaten.\xa0\n\nThe prey should be a wild animal that is too difficult to capture because it runs very fast or flies away. What is meant by wild is one that is wild by nature and cannot be caught except by means of tricks. As for tame or domesticated animals that have owners, it is not permissible to hunt them.\nIt should not be one of the game animals of the Haram zone. The jurists unanimously agreed that it is prohibited to hunt in the Haram zone any land animals – i.e., those that reproduce on land – regardless of whether their flesh may be eaten or not.\nThe animal should not disappear from the hunter’s view for a long time if he does not go and look for it. If the prey disappears from his view, and he does not go and look for it, then it cannot be eaten. But if it does not disappear, or it disappears but he does not fail to go and look for it, it may be eaten. This is a point on which the jurists agree in general.\nIf he shoots at the prey and part of its body is severed from it, but the animal is still alive, it is prohibited to eat the severed part. There is no difference of opinion among the jurists concerning that, because of the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “Whatever is cut from an animal when it is alive is (considered as) dead meat.” (Narrated by Abu Dawood, 2858; classed as authentic by Al-Albaani in Saheeh Abu Dawood)\n\nIf it is still alive, it must be slaughtered in the prescribed manner or else it too is prohibited, according to scholarly consensus.\nWith regard to sea animals, none of these conditions are stipulated with regard to them.\xa0\nAccording to the majority of jurists (Maalikis and Hanbalis; it is also the more correct view among the Shafi`is), it is permissible to catch and eat all sea animals, whether they are fish or otherwise, because of the words of Allah, may He be exalted (interpretation of the meaning): “Lawful to you is (the pursuit of) water game and its use for food” [Al-Ma’idah 5:96], i.e., hunting or catching it.\xa0\nTherefore, all sea creatures that live only in water are permissible, whether they are caught alive or dead.\nConditions pertaining to the tools of hunting\nWith regard to the “tools” used for hunting, they are of two types: inanimate or animate.\xa0\n\nInanimate “tools”\n\n\nIt is stipulated that the tool should be sharp so that it can pierce or cut the flesh, otherwise the meat is not permissible unless the animal is slaughtered in the prescribed manner.\n\nIt is not stipulated that the tool should be made of metal; rather it is acceptable to hunt with any sharp tool, whether it is made of metal or hard wood or stone that has been sharpened to a point, or similar materials that may pierce the body.\xa0\n\nIt is stipulated that the sharp edge should strike the prey and wound it, and it should be possible to ascertain that death was caused by this wounding, otherwise it is not permissible to eat it, because that which is killed by the blunt edge of the tool or its weight is regarded as having been killed by a violent blow, and is not permissible.\nIt is permissible to hunt with bullets ; whatever is shot with bullets , such as birds, rabbits and gazelles, and the name of Allah was invoked over it at the moment of opening fire, is permissible and may be eaten, even if it is found dead.\nThe jurists are of the view that it is not permissible to hunt with poisoned arrows if it is certain or thought most likely that the poison will help to kill the prey or that is possible, because two factors – one permissible and one prohibited – are combined in its killing, therefore the prohibited factor is deemed to take precedence. The same applies if both a Magian and a Muslim shoot arrows to kill the animal.\xa0\n\nHowever, if it is not possible (that the poison could kill the animal), then it is not prohibited to eat it.\n\nAnimate “tools”\n\nIt is permissible to hunt with trained animals, such as dogs, or other carnivores and birds which have fangs and talons, respectively. Trained dogs, lynxes, tigers, lions, falcons and other trained hunting-animals, such as various types of falcons, hawks and eagles are all the same in that regard.\xa0\nThe basic principle is that in general terms it is permissible to hunt with anything that may be taught and trained.\xa0\nConditions pertaining to the hunting animals\nWith regard to hunting-animals, the following conditions are stipulated:\n\nThe animal should be trained, according to the consensus of the jurists, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And those beasts and birds of prey which you have trained…” [Al-Ma’idah 5:4].\xa0\nThe animal should wound the prey in any part of its body, according to the Maalikis and Hanbalis; this is also the apparent meaning of the report and fatwas of the Hanafis, in contrast to the view of the Shafi`is. If the hunting animal kills it by a blow or bites it without causing a wound, it is not permissible, as in the case of an arrow if it kills it with its blunt edge or weight. The same applies if the hunter releases the dog and it catches the prey and breaks its neck, but does not wound it, or it jumps on its chest and suffocates it.\nThe hunting-animal should be released by a Muslim or a person from the People of the Book (Jewish or Christian), along with invocation of the name of Allah. If it goes forward by itself or runs away from its master, or he forgets to invoke the name of Allah when releasing it, then it catches some prey and kills it, it is not to be eaten. This is in general terms.\nThe animal should not be distracted by something else after it is released, so that the catch will be a direct result of it being released. This condition is stated by the Hanafis and Maalikis.\nThe jurists unanimously agreed that if one whose catch is permissible, such as a Muslim or Christian, hunts in partnership with one whose catch is not permissible, such as a Magian or idol-worshipper, then whatever they catch is prohibited and cannot be eaten. This is based on the principle that the factor that makes it prohibited takes precedence over the factor that makes it permissible.\n\nBased on that, if a Magian works with a Muslim, such as if they both shoot the prey or they both release a hunting animal to catch it, what is caught is prohibited, because both permissible and prohibited factors were present in killing it, so we give precedence to the factor that makes it prohibited in this case. (See: Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah, 28/117-142)\xa0\nHunting in violation of local laws\nIf the laws and regulations of the state do not permit hunting and they prohibit it, then it is not permissible to hunt, because that is contrary to the regulations of the state which you entered with a visa and a work contract, so you have to abide by whatever they have stipulated. By admitting you to their country, they only allow you to adhere to its regulations and laws. In most cases, when the state prohibits hunting it is in the public interest, and in that case you must abide by those regulations.\xa0\nEven if we assume that it is not obligatory to abide by those regulations, going against them exposes one to the risk of punishment and perhaps to expulsion from the country. The wise person does not try to do things that may bring harm to him or his family.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/194080/is-hunting-prohibited-in-islam
