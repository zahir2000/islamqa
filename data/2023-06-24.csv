270962,"During one of the laps bet ween as-Safa and al-Marwah, whilst doing  Sa’i, I walked backwards for approximately four steps in order to talk to my daughters. What is the ruling on my ‘umrah? What must I do, noting that I have returned to Madinah?","['Praise be to Allah.Walking backwards during your sa‘i does not matter, because the point is to cover the distance between as-Safa and al-Marwah, and you did that, so no matter how the person who is doing sa‘i walked, it is sufficient.\nIt says in Nihayat al-Muhtaj (3/292): If [the pilgrim] does seven laps, following the example of Hajar, going from as-Safa to al-Marwah is one lap, and coming back [from al-Marwah to as-Safa] is another lap, even if he walks on his hands, or he walks backwards, as appears to be the sound view, because the aim is to cover the distance. End quote.\nIn Fatawa ar-Ramli (2/86), it says: He was asked about someone who does sa‘i walking sideways, or walking backwards, or walking on his hands – is it valid?\nHe replied: Yes, it is valid. End quote.\nThis applies if what you mean by walking backwards is that you still walked in the direction of your lap, but with your back turned.\nHowever, if what you mean is that you walked back a few steps in the wrong direction, so you took a few steps backwards, that does not matter either, because a brief interruption does not have any impact, even if it is said that the laps should be done one after another, without interruption, as in the case of tawaf. All that happened is that you took a few extra steps, which is a minor issue.\nThe soundest view is that doing the laps without interruption is not stipulated, and that it is permissible for the individual to rest during his sa‘i. The same applies if he needs to take a few steps in the opposite direction during his sa‘i.\nConclusion: what you did does not matter, and your ‘Umrah is valid.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/270962/if-he-walked-backwards-or-on-his-hands-or-sideways-is-his-sai-valid
316796,"I found out that I should have offered a sacrifice when I did Hajj. I did Hajj tamattu‘ [‘umrah followed by Hajj, exiting ihram in between] for two years, but I did not offer a sacrifice and I did not fast for ten days, because I was unaware of the ruling, and that was not deliberate. What must I do now?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt is obligatory for the one who is doing tamattu‘ to offer a sacrifice, subject to two conditions:\n\nThat he is not one of those who live in the area of al-Masjid al-Haram, namely the residents of the Haram zone.\nThat he can afford the price of the sacrificial animal, meaning that he has wealth that is surplus to his expenses and basic needs, and those of his family, with which to buy the sacrificial animal.\n\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{then whoever performs ‘umrah [during the Hajj months] followed by Hajj [offers] what can be obtained with ease of sacrificial animals. And whoever cannot find [or afford such an animal] - then a fast of three days during Hajj and of seven when you have returned [home]. Those are ten complete [days]. This is for those whose family is not in the area of al-Masjid al-Haram}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:196].\nSee also the answer to question no. 112003 .\nSecondly:\nIf it is confirmed that offering the sacrifice was obligatory for you, it is not waived because of being unaware of the ruling or forgetting. Therefore you must seek Allah’s forgiveness for your shortcoming, and you must slaughter two sacrificial animals in Makkah and distribute the meat to the poor of the Haram, or appoint someone to do that on your behalf.\nShaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\nSomeone intended to do Hajj qiran [‘umrah followed by Hajj without exiting ihram in between] but he did not offer a sacrifice, because he was unaware of the ruling. After a long time, he realised that he should have offered a sacrifice. What must he do?\nHe said: He must offer the sacrifice as soon as he realises, to be slaughtered in Makkah or Mina. There is nothing wrong with him and his family and friends eating from it. End quote from Majmu‘ Fatawa ash-Shaykh Ibn Baz (18/25).\nShaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\nI did tamattu‘ [‘umrah followed by Hajj, exiting ihram in between], but I did not offer a sacrifice and I did not fast. What is the ruling?\nHe replied: Now you have to repent to Allah.\nIf you could afford a sacrificial animal in the year in which you did Hajj, then you must offer the sacrifice today, but it must be done in Makkah.\nIf you could not afford a sacrificial animal in the year in which you did Hajj, then you must fast ten days, so now fast ten days, even in your own city.""(Majmu‘ Fatawa ash-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin\xa022/213).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/316796/i-did-hajj-tamattu-for-two-years-but-did-not-offer-a-sacrifice-and-did-not-fast-ten-days-because-i-was-unaware-of-the-ruling-and-that-was-not-deliberate-what-must-i-do-now
