112139,I am not able to fast on Thursdays for certain reasons. Is it sufficient for me to fast on Monday every week or is it essential to fast both of them?,"['Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with fasting on one of the two days mentioned and not the other. Fasting on these two days is Sunnah and is not obligatory, so if someone fasts on both of them or one of them, he is doing a great good deed. It is not obligatory to fast on both of them; rather that is recommended (mustahabb) because of the sahih hadiths concerning that which were narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). And Allah is the source of strength.

114715,"Is it permissible for me to buy land with an area of 130 m² in a good suburb, for land with an area of 130,000 m² in a less valuable suburb? Is this a kind of riba al-fadl?","['Praise be to Allah.This is not one of the forms of riba, and land is not one of the categories of wealth that may be subject to riba when buying and selling, like gold and silver.\nTherefore it is permissible to sell land for land, whether it is of the same area or otherwise.\nIt is proven in Sahih al-Bukhari (1973) that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) bought from ‘Uthman (may Allah be pleased with him) some land of his in Madinah for land that he owned in Khaybar.\nIbn Hajar said in Fath al-Bari (6/438): This indicates that it is permissible to sell land for land.
