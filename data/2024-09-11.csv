111811,Is it obligatory for a man to spend on his grandchildren?,"['Praise be to Allah.It is obligatory for a man to spend on his children and grandchildren.\nWith regard to his children, that is because Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {And if they breastfeed for you, then give them their payment} [At-Talaq 65:6]. This verse indicates that the father is obliged to pay for breastfeeding the child.\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to Hind, the wife of Abu Sufyan, when she complained to him that Abu Sufyan was a stingy man: “Take – that is, from his wealth – that which will suffice you and your child on a reasonable basis.”\nTherefore it is obligatory for the child’s maintenance to be spent on from the wealth of the father.\nIbn Al-Mundhir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: All of the scholars from whom we acquired knowledge are unanimously agreed that a man is obliged to spend on the maintenance of his minor children who have no wealth. (End quote)\nIf the father is alive and is wealthy, then it is obligatory for him alone to spend on the children, and it is not obligatory for the mother.\nBut if the father is poor or is deceased, then the mother is obliged to spend on her children, if she is rich and they are poor.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Mughni (11/373):\nIf the father is not well off – meaning that he is poor – then spending [on the children’s maintenance] becomes obligatory for the mother. (End quote)\nWith regard to grandchildren, it is obligatory to spend on them, according to the majority of scholars, because a grandson may be called a “son” or “child.”\nAllah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Allah instructs you concerning your children: for the male, what is equal to the share of two females} [An-Nisa’ 4:11].\nThe word {children (Awlad)} in this verse includes the children of one’s son, according to scholarly consensus, and they are one’s grandchildren.\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said regarding Al-Hasan ibn `Ali (may Allah be pleased with them both): “This son of mine will be a leader.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 2704).\nAl-Hasan (may Allah be pleased with him) is the son of the daughter of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), his grandson through his daughter.\nThe fact that a grandson is called a son means that the grandson is included in the religious texts which indicate that it is obligatory to spend on one’s children.\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti` (13/498-499), in the chapter on spending on relatives:\nYour ascendants are those from whom you stem, fathers and mothers.\nYour descendants are those who stem from you, sons and daughters.\nThen he said:\nYou should understand that this issue is similar to the issue of what is prohibited for marriage; there is no difference between the father’s side or the mother’s side. Ascendants and descendants are the same, whether they are on the father’s side or the mother’s side or are entitled to an allocated share (of inheritance); it is obligatory to spend on them, but that is subject to some conditions. (End quote)\nIn order for it to be obligatory to spend on grandchildren, it is stipulated that they should be poor and have no wealth that could suffice them, and the grandfather should be rich, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Start with yourself and give charity to yourself. If there is anything left over, then (give) to your family. If there is anything left over from your family, then (give) to your relatives.” (Narrated by Muslim, 997)']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/111811/the-obligation-to-spend-on-children-and-grandchildren
5882,"I need your advise on the following, please. What happens if two people who are planning to get married both read their Istikharah Namaz and only the woman gets the message and not the man. This sister saw herself and her future husband as being happy and together and she feels that ALLAH is telling her that they are right for each other. But what if the man doesn't get any sign/feeling/dream whatsoever. What do they do then? And for how many days does one have to read this Namaz. Some people say for 3 days others say for 7.","['Praise be to Allah.Authentic evidence for the Istikharah prayer\nThe evidence for the Al-Istikharah prayer and the Du`a to be recited is the report narrated by Al-Bukhari (1109) and others from Jabir ibn `Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with them both).\xa0\nTrue signs of guidance after performing Istikharah\nWith regard to what some people say, then he should go ahead with whatever he feels happy with, a Hadith to this effect was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) narrated by Ibn As-Sunni according to which he said, If you are concerned about a matter, then offer Istikharah seven times, praying to your Lord, then see what you feel most drawn towards, and the good will be in that.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Its chain of narration is odd, and it includes narrators whom I do not know. (End quote from Al-Adhkar, p. 132)\nAl-Hafidh ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If this were proven, it could be taken as evidence, but its chain of narration is very inauthentic. (End quote from Al-Fat-h, 11/223)\nAl-Hafidh Al-`Iraqi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It contains a narrator who is known to be very inauthentic, namely Ibrahim ibn Al-Bara’.. Therefore, the Hadith is very inauthentic. (End quote from Al-Futuhat Ar-Rabbaniyyah, 3/357)\nUnderstanding the significance of ease and obstacles\nThe correct view is that when Allah makes something easy for you after having decreed it and accepted your Du`a this is a sign that it is good to go ahead and do it. The existence of obstacles and difficulties is an indication that Allah is pushing His slave away from doing it. This meaning will be very clear when one ponders the meaning of the Hadith of Jabir concerning Al-Istikharah , where the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:\nO Allah, if You know this affair [and here he should mention it] is good for me in relation to my religion, my life, and end, then decree and facilitate it for me, and bless me with it, and if You know this affair to be ill for me towards my religion, my life, and end, then remove it from me and remove me from it, and decree for me what is good wherever it be and make me satisfied with such.\nIbn `Allan (may Allah have mercy on him) after transmitting the scholarly view that the Hadith of Anas is inauthentic said: Therefore it was said: that after (doing Istikharah ) he should do what he wants (i.e., even if he does not feel that sense of being happy), because whatever happens after doing Istikharah is good\nAl-Hafidh ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Al-Hafidh Zayn Ad-Din Al-`Iraqi said (concerning doing something after praying Istikharah): Whatever he does, there will be good in it. This is supported by what is said at the end of the Hadith of Ibn Mas`ud according to some of its chains of narration: Then let him make his decision. I (Ibn Hajar) say: I have already discussed above and explained that its narrators (i.e., the narrators who added the phrase Then let him make his decision) are inauthentic. But this is still stronger than the narrator of that Hadith (i.e., the Hadith which says, then see what you feel most drawn towards). (End quote from Al-Futuhat Ar-Rabbaniyyah, 3/355-357)\nThe relation between Istikharah and dreams\nAnother of the myths that are widespread among people is that after praying Istikharah you should sleep, and whatever good you see in your dream that makes you happy means that what you want to do is good and will be made easy for you, otherwise it is not good. (This is what the questioner meant by saying gets the message). There is no authentic evidence for this as far as we know.\nThe above does not mean that if you feel happy it is not a sign, but this should not be regarded as the only sign about whether or not the matter is good. People often make Istikharah about something they like or want to do, so they feel happy about it from the outset.\nShaykh Al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyah] (may Allah have mercy on him) said concerning the matter of feeling happy about something: If he makes Istikharah, then whatever Allah makes him feel happy about and makes it easy for him, this is what Allah has chosen for him. (End quote from Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 10/539)\nRepeating Istikharah: Is there a limit?\nThere is a difference between making feeling happy the only sign and making it one of several signs. There is no set time period for Salat Al-Istikharah; it is permissible to repeat it more than once, but there is no limit to how many times. The person may offer the Du`a before or after saying the Salam (when concluding the prayer).\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/5882/istikharah-signs
127884,"I want to ask about the service offered by one of the mobile phone networks in Egypt, which is called “Sallifni…Shukran (lit. Give me a loan… Thank you).”  With this service, the user can borrow three Egyptian pounds, if his phone no longer has credit, and he pays it back after he load the card. But the actual value that is loaned is 2.50 Egyptian pounds, because the cost of the service is 0.50 pounds. Is this regarded as riba (usury)?","['Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with subscribing to this service, because it is selling a service and is not selling money for money. Moreover, it is not a loan, because the company is providing telephone service for a deferred payment of a higher price than if one is paying with cash up front. The benefit of connection to the service, of which the value is 2.50 pounds, is being sold for 3.00 pounds to be paid later, which the company will receive from the customer after he loads his mobile phone. This transaction is permissible.\nThe company is not really lending you money, then taking it back later on with something extra, such that it could be said that it is riba. Rather it is selling you a service at a higher price, and there is nothing wrong with increasing the price in return for a deferral of payment.\nIn Qararat Majma` Al-Fiqh Al-Islami, no. 51 (2/6) it says:\nIt is permissible to charge more for deferred payment than the price if it is paid up front. (End quote from Qararat Majma` Al-Fiqh Al-Islami, p. 109).\nThe reason for the confusion about this issue is calling this transaction a loan (Salaf). It is not correct to call it this; rather it is selling a benefit [phone service] for a deferred payment that is higher than the price if it is paid up front.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/127884/ruling-on-subscribing-to-the-mobile-phone-service-called-sallifnishukran
119830,What is the ruling on eating the meat of animals that have been fed with plants that have been genetically modified?,"['Praise be to Allah.Understanding Genetically Modified Foods\nResearch is still ongoing into the effect of genetically modified plants on humans, plants, animals and the environment, and even on the economy. There are still specialists who advise not hastening to accept what appears to be the case with regard to genetically modified plants of abundant production and the ability to overcome defects and resist disease.\xa0\nGlobal Perspective on GMOs\nThere are two main points of view with regard to this issue: the first is that which is adopted by American companies and American government organisations, which is to allow the use of genetically modified plants and marketing of their products. The other view, which is the opposite view, is that which is adopted by the European Union, which bans cultivation (of genetically modified plants) in its territory and warns against its possible consequences.\xa0\nThe matter is still not definitive with regard to its effects, because it needs years for the impact to materialise, according to specialists. The fact that we have some plants which are more resistant to pesticides means that they will be used a great deal, which will pose a danger to the environment and human health. The fact that the plant has this strength means that it will enter the body of the one that eats it. As is well known, the countries that import these plants will never be able to plant the seeds of these plants in their lands again. What this means is that they will remain under the control and domination of the companies that produce these seeds, and this is what will affect the quality of the plants produced and will affect the economy of the importing country, as it will continue importing and consuming, and not producing independently.\xa0\nThe Arab Organisation for Agricultural Development held a conference in Sudan 15-17/6/2003 CE, the subject of which was: Evaluating the Environmental Impact of Introducing Various Kinds of Genetically Modified Plants and Animals.\xa0\nWe will quote from that conference statements which will explain this issue, before ruling on what was mentioned in the question.\xa0\n\n\xa0(On p. 45) Dr. `Awad-Allah ibn `Abdullah `Abd Al-Mawla — Prof of Horticulture and Genetics in the College of Agriculture, Khartoum University — says:\n\nWhat are genetically modified products?\nThis is a phrase which refers to the products of some crops which have been genetically engineered, which means introducing a foreign gene to the original genetic material. The foreign gene may come from different sources, and is introduced to increase the value and improve the genetic qualities of the genetically engineered plant. Usually plants are genetically altered for two purposes, namely:\n\nTo reduce the cost of producing these plants, by making the plant resistant to disease.\nTo improve the quality of the product, by improving its appearance or nutritional components with regard to qualities that have to do with manufacturing and storage.\n\nProduction of these genetically modified products is done using genetic engineering techniques. This involves first identifying the gene responsible for the desired quality and isolating it, then introducing it to the living being (the receiver). After this new gene has been mixed with the genetic material of the genetically engineered plant, it is possible to increase the number of cells in which the new gene is successfully mixed, then by means of tissue planting it becomes possible to produce complete plants from the cells, and these plants become genetically modified or engineered. Once this gene becomes well established in the genetically engineered plant, it becomes possible to transfer it to other types of the same crop by using traditional methods of raising plants, by means of hybridisation and crossbreeding.\xa0\n\nIn a paper entitled Genetic Modification: Justifications, Benefits and its Impact on the Environment and Society, by Dr. Lakhdar Khalifi and Dr. Majidah Khalifi, it says (p. 15):\n\nIn the field of genetic modification in particular, there is a clear difference between American and European law. Whilst American law regards genetically modified foods as natural foods that do not pose any danger until proven otherwise, European law — especially French law — regards genetically modified foods as unnatural and a possible source of danger until proven otherwise. End quote.\xa0\nIs Genetically Modified Food Permissible in Islam?\nThe one who researches this issue cannot state that it is prohibited to eat genetically modified crops and fruits unless it is proven for certain that they are harmful. This does not mean that we can be careless about this matter, because of what we have pointed out above of the possibility that they may pose a danger in many ways, and because people still prefer natural plants and crops, and people like them even if they are more expensive.\xa0\nThe matter still needs more research and more time until the effects of these plants and the harm they may cause becomes clear.\xa0\nUntil it is proven that they are harmful, the basic principle is that these plants are permissible and it is permissible to eat animals that have been fed on these plants, but it is also essential to be cautious about what these plants may cause in the future, and it is essential to follow up on research and information about these plants.\xa0\nFor more details, please see the following answers:\xa021582 , 119830 , 155691 , 308325 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/119830/is-genetically-modified-food-permissible-in-islam
83154,What is the ruling on praying in clothes on which there are images of some animals which may be part of a manufacturing company’s logo such as tigers or crocodiles?.,"['Praise be to Allah.Can you wear clothes with images?\nIt is not permissible to wear clothes on which there are images of animals or people , because of the report narrated by Al-Bukhari (3226) and Muslim (2106) from Abu Talhah (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The angels do not enter any house in which there is an image.”\xa0(Matalib Uli An-Nuha, 1/353)\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about the ruling on wearing clothes on which there are images of animals or people. He replied: It is not permissible for a person to wear clothes on which there is an image of an animal or a person, and it is not permissible to wear Ghutrahs or other headgear on which there is an image of a person or an animal, because it is proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The angels do not enter any house in which there is an image.”\xa0\nHence, we do not think that anyone should keep pictures for memories , as they say, and whoever has any pictures for memories should destroy them, whether he put them on the wall or in an album etc, because keeping them deprives the people of the house of the angels’ entering upon them. And Allah knows best. End quote\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) was also asked about the ruling on children wearing clothes on which there are images of animate beings.\nHe replied:\xa0\nThe scholars said that it is prohibited to dress a child in what it is prohibited for adults to wear. Whatever has an image on it, it is prohibited for adults to wear it, so it is also prohibited for children to wear it. This is the answer. What the Muslims should do is to boycott these clothes and shoes, so that the evildoers will have no means of reaching us in this matter. If they are boycotted they will never find a way of bringing them into this land, because when they are boycotted there will be no point in bringing them here. (End quote from Majmu` Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin,\xa0 12/333)\xa0\nIs the payer offered in clothes with images valid?\nPrayer offered in a garment that has images of people or animals on it is valid, but there is some sin involved.\xa0\nThe Scholars of the Standing Committee were asked: Is it permissible to pray in a garment on which there is an image of a person or images of animals? Is it permissible to enter the toilet in a garment on which there is the name of Allah?\xa0\nThey replied:\xa0\nIt is not permissible to pray in clothes on which there are images of animate beings , whether people, birds, camels, cattle, sheep, or other animate beings, and it is not permissible for a Muslim to wear them when he is not praying either.\xa0\nThe prayer of one who prays wearing clothes on which there are images is valid, but he is sinning if he knows the Shar`i ruling. It is not permissible to write the name of Allah on clothing, and it is disliked to enter the toilet wearing it, because that is showing disrespect to His name, may He be Exalted. (End quote from\xa0Fatawa Al-Lajnah Al-Da’imah, 6/179)\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about the ruling on the prayer of one who prays in a garment on which are embroidered or printed images of animate beings .\xa0\nHe replied:\xa0\nIf he is unaware, there is no sin on him, but if he knew (the ruling) then his prayer is valid but there is some sin involved, according to the more correct of the two scholarly rulings. Some scholars said that his prayer is invalid, because he has prayed in a garment that is prohibited for him. (End quote from Majmu` Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin, 12/360)\xa0\nBased on this, you have to remove the image of the tiger or crocodile from your clothes , or distort the image by removing the head or covering it with some colour or thread that will hide it.
