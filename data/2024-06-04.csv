498974,Does committing a minor sin with other people come under the heading of committing sin openly?,"['Praise be to Allah.It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “All of my ummah will be safe, except those who commit sin openly, and it is part of committing sin openly for a man to do something at night, then in the morning when his Lord has concealed him, he says: O So and so, I did such and such last night, when his Lord had concealed him all night, but in the morning he discloses that which Allah had concealed for him.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (6069) and Muslim (2990).\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nRegarding the words “All of my ummah will be safe [mu‘afa]”, the word ‘afiyah [translated here as “safe”] either means that Allah will pardon him, or that Allah will grant him safety and grant others safety from him.""(Fath al-Bari\xa0 10/486).\nThe one who commits sin openly is the one who makes no attempt to conceal his sin.\nIbn al-Athir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “All of my ummah will be safe, except those who commit sin openly” – this refers to those who sin openly, making no attempt to conceal it, and they disclose what Allah had concealed of it for them, so they speak openly of it.""(An-Nihayah fi Gharib al-Hadith\xa0 1/321).\nThis hadith is general in meaning and is not limited to openly committing acts that are regarded as major sins. It is to be understood in general terms, therefore it forbids openly committing minor sins just as it forbids openly committing major sins.\nAs openly committing sin may include speaking of it and telling others about it, it also includes committing sinful acts in front of other people.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“All of my ummah will be safe (mu‘afa)” means that Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has pardoned them.\n“except those who commit sin openly” – those who commit sin openly are those who openly disobey Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. They may be divided into two categories:\nThe first category refers to one who commits sin openly, so he does it in front of other people whilst they are looking on. Undoubtedly he is not safe, because he has brought trouble upon himself and has brought it upon other people too [because they may imitate him].\nAs for his bringing trouble upon himself, that is because he wronged himself when he disobeyed Allah and His Messenger, and everyone who disobeys Allah and His Messenger is wronging himself…\nAs for his bringing trouble upon others, that is because if people see him committing sin, that action will become insignificant in their minds, and they may do the same as him.\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon himself) said: “Whoever sets a bad precedent in Islam, upon him will be the burden of that sin and a burden like that of those who commit that sin until the Day of Resurrection.”\nThis is a type of committing sin openly which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not mention, because the matter is clear.\nBut he did mention something else, which may not be clear to some people, as he said: “It is part of committing sin openly for a man to commit an evil action at night, and Allah conceals it for him” – or he does that in his house, and Allah conceals it for him and does not let anyone know about it. If he were to repent from it privately, between him and his Lord, that would be better for him, but if he gets up in the morning and mixes with people, and says: I did such and such last night, and I did such and such, and I did such and such, then he will not be safe, for Allah concealed him, but in the morning he exposed his deeds… Therefore he is not one of those who will be safe, because he is one of those who commit sin openly.""(Sharh Riyadh as-Salihin, 3/16-17).\nIf a person commits sin with others, such as his companions and friends, then he may undoubtedly come under the heading of committing sin openly, if the doer does that deed openly, without caring and without accepting the concealment of Allah, even if the sin is something that could not happen except with other people, such as backbiting and spreading malicious gossip.\nThe Islamic principle is that matters are to be judged on the basis of the purpose and intention behind them.\nThat is because the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Deeds are but by intentions and each man will have but that which he intended.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (1) and Muslim (1907).\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: What matters is aims and purposes when one says and does anything, because if we say something, then say something else, changing the order of the words but the meaning remains the same, then both are subject to the same ruling. If the words are similar but the meanings are different, then they are subject to different rulings. The same applies to deeds. The one who reflects properly on Islamic teachings will undoubtedly understand that what is said above is sound.""(I‘lam al-Muwaqqi‘in\xa0 4/552).\nSo if the doer did not intend to display recklessness and carelessness by committing sin in front of people, and he did not intend to show audacity by sinning openly – rather it was a mistake that he made when he was among his friends, then what appears to be the case is that this does not come under the heading of committing sin openly because of which the doer will be deprived of safety and pardon, because he did not do that deliberately.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/498974/does-committing-sin-with-ones-friends-come-under-the-heading-of-committing-sin-openly
191792,"What is the ruling on saying “Labbayk ya Muhammad (Here I am at your service O Muhammad)” or “Labbayk ya Rasul Allah (Here I am at your service, O Messenger of Allah)”?","['Praise be to Allah.With regard to someone saying “Labbayk ya Rasul Allah” during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), there is no confusion about this being permissible. It is something that was well known among the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on many occasions.\xa0\nAl-Bukhari (128) and Muslim (32) narrated from Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was riding a mount with Mu`adh seated behind him, and he said: “O Mu`adh ibn Jabal.” Mu`adh said: “Labbayk ya Rasul Allah wa Sa`dayk (Here I am at your service, O Messenger of Allah).” He said: “O Mu`adh.” Mu`adh said: “Labbayk ya Rasul Allah wa Sa`dayk” – three times – he (the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no one who bears witness that none is worthy of worship but Allah, and that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger, but Allah will forbid him to the Fire.”\xa0\nIbn Al-Anbari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “What is meant by saying Labbayk is: I am persisting in obeying you. They used to use the related verb Labba to refer to staying in a place, and what is meant by Sa`dayk is following. Another scholar said: What is meant by Labbayk is responding time after time, and what is meant by Sa`dayk is following time after time. Al-Muhallab said: Responding by saying yes and any other word that gives the meaning of yes is sufficient, but responding to the call of a master by honouring him and saying Labbayka wa Sa`dayk is better.” (Sharh Sahih Al-Bukhari, 9/50)\xa0\nOnce it is known that calling in this manner or speaking in this manner is only appropriate in the case of one who is still alive, then such a call can only be made to one who is alive and is able to hear the one who is calling him, and such words can only be addressed to one who is alive and can hear the words that are said to him. Nothing can be requested except of one who is alive and can hear, and is able to respond to the request that is made of him.\xa0\nHowever, what appears to be the case with regard to those who say these words and make them a slogan, and call others to it, is that they want to exaggerate in showing extreme obedience to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and adherence to his path, and to annoy those who oppose him and hate him. These are good aims that are in accordance with Islamic teachings, but this wording may give the impression – to one who does not understand the real meaning intended – that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is like any other human who is alive, and that he can hear those who call upon him or talk to him; the one who does that may move on from that to calling upon him and seeking his help, because of the wrong impression that these words may give.\xa0\nTherefore it would have been more appropriate to avoid such a slogan and to replace it with other words concerning which there is no ambiguity, especially since the true way of showing obedience to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and showing support for him, which he loved and which truly annoyed his enemies and haters, can only be by constantly obeying him and adhering to his teachings, not merely uttering claims and words.\xa0\nShaykh Salih Al-Fawzan (may Allah preserve him) was asked:\xa0\nThere are some stickers in shops on which it is written “Labbayk ya Rasul Allah”. Is this phrase permissible? Is it shirk? What should we do about it?\xa0\nHe replied:\xa0\n“The word “Labbayk” is for Allah – “Labbayk Allahumma labbayk (Here I am at Your service, O Allah; here I am).” With regard to the phrase “Labbayk ya Rasul Allah”, if the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) were to call you (when he was still alive) and say, “O So and so,” you would say,\xa0 “Labbayk ya Rasul Allah”, as the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) used to say when he called them. They would say: “Labbayk ya Rasul Allah.” But after his death, no one should say, “Labbayk ya Rasul Allah.” Rather you should say: “Labbayk Allahumma labbayk.”\nFor more details, please refer to the following answers: 72242 , 604 , 14250 , and 258503 .\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/191792/can-we-say-labbayk-ya-rasul-allah

401485,"If someone admits that he is Shi‘i, but I have not seen him do any innovation and he did not say or do anything that is contrary to the way of Ahl as-Sunnah, how should I deal with this type of people?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe Shi‘ah have many groups and schools of thought. Some of them believe that the Quran has been distorted and they regard most of the Sahabah as disbelievers, especially the two shaykhs Abu Bakr and ‘Umar, and they seek to draw close to the dead by worshipping them and calling upon them besides Allah, and some of them are less extreme than that.\nPlease see the answer to question no. 97448 .\nSecondly:\nSomeone may claim to be Shi‘i without realising the truth about their beliefs and views, or paying any attention to that, or paying any attention to religion and knowledge. There may be among them those who practice taqiyyah (dissimulation), showing outwardly something other than what he really believes in. This is common among them, especially in places where Ahl as-Sunnah have the upper hand.\nPlease see the answer to question no. 178975 .\nThirdly:\nWith regard to dealing with someone who does not openly practice the innovations of the Shi‘ah, there are two issues to be noted:\nThe first issue has to do with the rights he has as a Muslim, and so on. We should deal with such a person on the basis of what he appears to be. Hence so long as he is Muslim and acts as a Muslim, and there are no actions or words on his part that are contrary to Islam, then he has the same rights as any other Muslim, so he should be greeted with salaam, visited when he is sick and his funeral should be attended.\nThe second issue to be noted is our duties towards him, which are: Calling him in the way that is best, and explaining to him the beliefs of Ahl as-Sunnah regarding issues such as tawhid (affirmation of Allah’s oneness), the divine attributes, the Quran, the divine decree, the Sahabah, and the difference between the Sunni way and the Shi‘i way.

210145,"Is it permissible to deliberately look at the Ka`bah during Tawaf (circumambulation)? As I love to look at the Ka`bah during Tawaf, but if doing this is disliked according to Shari`ah, I shall stop doing it in sha Allah.","['Praise be to Allah.There is no authentic Hadith about the virtue of looking at the Ka`bah , and simply looking at it is not an act of worship for which a person will be rewarded. But if looking at it is accompanied by thinking about the splendour and majesty that Allah has instilled in it, and how people long to come to it from the ends of the earth, then this is something good that is islamically prescribed, and there is nothing wrong with it, whether that is during Tawaf or otherwise.\xa0\nAt-Tirmidhi (2032) narrated, in a report that he classed as sound, that Nafi` (may Allah have mercy on him) the freed slave of Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: One day Ibn `Umar looked at the House – or at the Ka`bah – and said: How great you are and how great your sanctity, but the sanctity of the believer is greater before Allah than you.
