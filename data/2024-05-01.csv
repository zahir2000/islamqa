322661,"I was talking with my friend about the etiquette of debate, and saying that if you advise me in front of a group, then you have shamed me, but if you advise me in front of six eyes, then you have been sincere in your advice to me. He said to me: What do you mean by six eyes? I said to him: As for the four eyes, they are my two eyes and your two eyes. As for the other two eyes, they are the two eyes of ar-Rahman (the Most Gracious), which are real, because He, may He be glorified, has two real eyes, without likening them to anything, discussing how they are, denying them, interpreting them in a manner other than the apparent meaning, or distorting the meaning. Allah sees me with His two eyes that are real. And I quoted as evidence the verse in which Allah, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning):","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nAhl as-Sunnah affirm the divine attribute of the Eye; in their view, it is an attribute of His Essence that is known from the religious texts and is affirmed for Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, on the basis of the Quran and Sunnah. Ahl as-Sunnah wa’l-Jama‘ah believe that Allah sees with His eyes, and they believe that Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has two eyes in a manner that is befitting to Him. {There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the Hearing, the Seeing} [Ash-Shura 42:11].\nThe evidence for that from the Quran:\n-1-\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And construct the ship under Our watchful eyes and Our inspiration}\xa0[Hud 11:37].\n-2-\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And I bestowed upon you love from Me that you would be brought up under My eye} [Ta-Ha 20:39].\n-3-\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Be patient with your Lord’s decree [O Muhammad], for verily you are under Our watchful eyes}\xa0[at-Tur 52:48].\nEvidence from the Sunnah:\n-1-\nAbu Dawud (13/37) narrated from ‘Awn with a hasan isnad from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) recited this verse (interpretation of the meaning): {Indeed, Allah is ever Hearing and Seeing} [an-Nisa’ 4:58], and he placed his thumb on his ear and his forefinger over his eyes.\n-2-\nIt was narrated that ‘Abdullah said: Mention was made of the Dajjal in the presence of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and he said: “Allah is not unknown to you. Indeed Allah is not one-eyed” – and he pointed to his eye – “but the false messiah the Dajjal is one-eyed and cannot see out of his right eye; his eye is like a floating grape.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (7407).\nIbn Khuzaymah said in Kitab at-Tawhid (1/97), after quoting a number of verses: It is obligatory for every believer to affirm for his Creator and Maker what the Creator and Maker affirmed for Himself of eyes. He is not a true believer who denies for Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, what He has affirmed for Himself in a clear text and was explained by the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), to whom Allah gave the task of explaining His words, as He said (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And We revealed to you the message that you may make clear to the people what was sent down to them}\xa0[An-Nahl 16:44].\nSo the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) explained that Allah has two eyes, and his explanation was in accordance with the revealed text, which you find in the pages of the Mushaf and it is recited by the imams in prayer and is taught to children in the schools.\nAnd he said (1/114): We say: Our Lord the Creator has two eyes with which He sees whatever lies beneath the ground, whatever lies beneath the lowest, seventh earth, and whatever is in the highest heavens… End quote.\nAl-Lalka’i included a chapter in Usul al-I‘tiqad (412) with the title: Texts from the Book of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, and the Sunnah of His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) which indicate that the attributes of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, include the Face, the two Eyes and the two Hands. End quote.\nShaykh ‘Abdullah al-Ghunayman said in Sharh Kitab at-Tawhid min Sahih al-Bukhari (1/285): The words “Allah is not one-eyed”: this phrase is where the evidence regarding this matter is to be found in this hadith. This indicates that Allah has two real eyes, because the one who is one-eyed is lacking one of the two eyes, or has lost vision in one eye. End quote.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said in ‘Aqidat Ahl as-Sunnah wa’l-Jama‘ah (p. 12): Ahl as-Sunnah are unanimously agreed that the divine eyes are two, and that is supported by what the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said about the Dajjal: “He is one-eyed and your Lord is not one-eyed.” End quote.\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) gave a lengthy answer about this attribute, in which he affirmed that Allah has two eyes, in Majmu‘ al-Fatawa (3/41-50).\nSee also what al-Baghawi said about His Fingers and what Ibn Kathir said about His hearing.\nEnd quote from Sifat Allah by Shaykh ‘Alawi as-Saqqaf (260-262).\nSee also the answer to question no. 145166 .\nSecondly:\nWhat we think is that the way you spoke to your friend was too complicated and there was no need for it.\nYes, we affirm the divine attribute of the eye in a manner that befits the divine attribute of His Face, and we also say that He has two eyes, not one eye, and we would not refrain from pointing out that they are two, because the text is clear about that, as explained above. More than one of the scholars narrated that there is consensus among Ahl as-Sunnah on affirming that they are two eyes.\nThe impact of that on the individual’s behaviour and attitude is that he will strive hard not to let Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, see him where He forbade him to be, and to let Him see him where He commanded him to be; he will strive to do what Allah likes to see him do and will be wary of doing anything that will deprive him of Allah, the Most Generous, looking at him and will deprive him of that blessing.\nBut mentioning that in the plural form including your two eyes, the two eyes of your friend and the two eyes of the Most Gracious, may He be glorified and exalted, is unnecessary and silly. It is as if you wanted to say something weird, as is quite clear, since your friend needed to ask you about these six and you needed to explain that to him, then you had to follow that by mentioning how Ahl as-Sunnah wa’l-Jama‘ah understand the divine attributes. All of that is unnecessary; rather it would have been sufficient for you to remind him of the etiquette of offering advice, and the difference between that and shaming someone or exposing his faults, in accordance with what the scholars have said about the matter, with no need for any of the things you mentioned.\nTherefore, we advise you not to do that or anything similar to it, and not to complicate straightforward matters. You should limit yourself to that which is clear and used by the scholars, and what was transmitted from the righteous predecessors (as-salaf as-salih); we did not see any of that in what you said.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/322661/the-divine-attribute-of-the-eye-and-affirming-that-allah-possesses-this-attribute
97938,"Is it permissible for a very close friend of mine to remove pubic hair for me? I am very afraid and I am having problems because of this hair. If my friend removes it for me there will be a pact between us that she will never speak of anything that she sees, and I need to remove it, but I feel too shy to ask my mother to remove it for me?","['Praise be to Allah.Shaving the pubic hair is one of the Sunnahs of the Fitrah , and Islam has stipulated that it should not be left without shaving for more than forty days . The basic principle is that every accountable person should shave his pubic hair himself, unless he is unable to do that because he is too old or is sick .\xa0\nWhat the sister who is asking this question wants to do is a prohibited action, and is an evil deed that it is not permissible for any Muslim woman to do except in cases of necessity. The fact that she is afraid to remove her hair is no excuse. This is not something that requires bravery and courage. There are many ways of removing it, some of which are easy.\xa0\nIt does not make it permissible if her friend swears an oath not to tell anyone of what she sees. If it is permissible to do this because of necessity, her mother is a better person to shave her pubic hairs.\xa0\nThe authentic texts state that it is prohibited for a man to look at the `Awrah of another man , or for a woman to look at the `Awrah of another woman , and the scholars unanimously agreed on this prohibition.\xa0\nIt was narrated that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No man should look at the `Awrah of another man, and no woman should look at the `Awrah of another woman.”\xa0(Narrated by Muslim, 338)\xa0\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “As for a man with another man, each of them may look at that of his companion which is not `Awrah. And the ruling on a woman with a woman is the same as the ruling on a man with a man.” (Al-Mughni, 7/80)\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“This is covering of women before men, and covering of men before men and women before women with regard to the `Awrah, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No man should look at the `Awrah of another man, and no woman should look at the `Awrah of another woman, and he said: “Guard your `Awrah from everyone but your wife and that which your right hand possesses (i.e., slave woman).” I said: What if the people are living with one another?\xa0 He said: “If you can prevent anyone seeing it, then do not let him see it.” I said: What if I am alone? He said: “Allah is more deserving that you should feel shy before Him.” And he forbade a man to lie with a man under one cover, or a woman to lie with a woman under one cover. And he said concerning children: “Teach them to pray when they are seven and smack them if they do not pray when they are ten, and separate them in their beds.” He forbade looking at or touching the `Awrah of a person of the same gender, because that is abhorrent and immoral. As for men with women, this is because of the issue of sexual desire.” (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 22/113)\xa0\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“… This is something concerning which there is no difference of opinion. It is prohibited for a man to look at a woman’s `Awrah and for a woman to look at a man’s `Awrah, according to scholarly consensus. An exception is made for the married couple, who may look at one another’s `Awrahs.” (Fath Al-Bari, 9/338, 339)\xa0\nIn conclusion, it is not permissible for you to ask your friend to shave your pubic hair for you, or to let her do that. If you do that, you will both be committing a major sin, and you will not be excused for that, because it is easy to find other ways of removing this hair, such as using the well-known depilatories, if you cannot use a razor.\xa0\nThis is permissible in cases of necessity when one is unable to move , or if one is sick or insane and other cases where a man or woman is unable to shave the pubic hair.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/97938/can-a-woman-remove-the-pubic-hair-of-another-woman
150788,"Is it permissible for the marriage contract to be done by a guardian who is more distantly related than the original guardian when the latter is available, due to social reasons?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nGuardianship with regard to marriage is a very serious matter, which Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has prescribed for His slaves to protect women and their rights, and to look after their interests. Therefore Islam does not allow the woman to be in charge of the marriage contract, whether for herself or for anyone else, and it does not allow her to choose her guardian for marriage or to appoint her own proxy. Rather there is a prescribed order of precedence, and it is not up to people to choose.\nAl-Bahuti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe father of a free woman is to be given precedence in arranging her marriage, because he has more insight into what is best for her and is more compassionate towards her. Next in order of precedence comes his proxy, meaning the proxy of the father who acts on his behalf in doing the marriage contract. Next in order of precedence comes the paternal grandfather or great-grandfather…, no matter how far the line of ascent reaches, the closest then the next closest, because he is an ancestor and is a male relative on the father’s side, so he is like the father. Then comes her son, then his son or grandson…, no matter how far the line of descent reaches, the closest then the next closest, because of the report narrated by Umm Salamah, which says that when her ‘iddah ended, the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) sent word to her, proposing marriage, but she said: O Messenger of Allah, none of my guardians are present. He said: “None of your guardians, present or absent, would disapprove of that.” So she said [to her son]: O ‘Umar, get up and give your mother in marriage to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and he did so. Narrated by an-Nasa’i. Next in order of precedence comes the woman’s brother through both parents (full brother), then her brother through the father (half-brother), as in the case of inheritance, then their sons or grandsons…, no matter how far the line of descent reaches. Precedence is given to sons and grandsons of her brothers who are connected to her through both parents over those who are connected to her only through the father, if they are equal in degree, the closest then the next closest. Then comes her paternal uncle who is a full brother to her father, then the paternal uncle who is a brother to her father through their father only, because of what is noted above. Then come the sons of the paternal uncles, according to what was mentioned above regarding inheritance. Then come the closest of male kin on the father’s side, as in the case of inheritance. The most entitled of the male kin after the brothers with regard to inheritance are the most entitled with regard to guardianship, because guardianship is based on compassion and seeking what is in the best interests of the woman under their guardianship, and that is achieved when there are ties of kinship. Then comes the master who has manumitted his slave, because he may inherit from her and is required to pay blood money on her behalf [if that is needed]. Then come the closest of the former master’s kin on his father’s side, in the same order of precedence as for inheritance. If there are no such relatives, next in order of precedence comes ties of wala’ as mentioned above, then the ruler – which refers to the leader or his deputy. Ahmad said: I prefer the judge to the governor in this matter. If none of them is available, then anyone with authority in the place where the woman lives may give her in marriage.""(Ar-Rawd al-Murbi‘\xa0 335-336).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThere are five categories of guardianship with regard to marriage: fathers, then sons, then brothers, then paternal uncles, then wala’. If they are all of the same degree of kinship, then precedence is given to the one who is most closely related, and the one who is most closely related is the one whose lineage meets with the lineage of the woman whose marriage is to be arranged before that of the other one. So the one who has a common ancestor within three generations is closer than the one who has a common ancestor within four, and so on. If they are of the same degree, then the one who has stronger ties takes precedence. So if there is a full brother and a brother through the father only, the full brother is the guardian.""(Ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘\xa0 12/84).\nSecondly:\nIt is essential to pay attention to the order of precedence between guardians, based on what has been noted above. Therefore it is not permissible to give precedence to the more distantly related guardian over the more closely related guardian with regard to doing the marriage contract.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf the more distantly related guardian gives her in marriage in the presence of the more closely related guardian, and if she agrees to him giving her in marriage without the permission of the more closely related guardian, then the marriage contract is not valid. This is the view of ash-Shafa‘i.\nMalik said: The marriage contract is valid, because he is a guardian and has the right to give her in marriage, with her permission, like the one who is more closely related.\nIn our view, this guardianship is based on being a male relative on the father’s side, and this cannot be allowed for one who is more distantly related when one who is more closely related is there, as in the case of inheritance.""(Al-Mughni (7/364); see also: al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah\xa0 33/90).\nAl-Bahuti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf a guardian who is more distantly related gives her in marriage, or a non-relative gives her in marriage, even the ruler, without there being any reason for the guardian who is more closely related not being able to be present, then the marriage is not valid, because the one who did the marriage contract on her behalf has no right to guardianship over her when the one who has the right to guardianship is present.""(Ar-Rawd al-Murbi‘\xa0 336).\nOne of the valid excuses which make it permissible to overlook the more closely related guardian for one who is more distantly related than him with regard to doing the marriage contract is if he is not qualified to do the marriage contract.\nAl-Hajawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Zad al-Mustaqni‘:\nIf the close relative refuses to give her in marriage (to a compatible suitor) or is not qualified to do that, or he is away travelling and cannot come except with difficulty and hardship, then a more distant relative may give her in marriage.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said in ash-Sharh:\nSaying that he is not qualified to be a guardian means that he is not qualified for that because he is a minor or an evildoer or is of a different religion and the like, because if the guardian is available but is not qualified, it is as if he is not there, because there is no benefit in his being available.""(Ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘\xa0 12/89).\nConclusion: it is not permissible for the more distantly related guardian to do the marriage contract when a more closely related guardian is present, unless there is a legitimate excuse which makes doing that permissible.\nIf the social reasons mentioned in the question prevent the more closely related guardian from doing the marriage contract – such as if he is incompetent or unable to do the right thing, or he is an evildoer, or other legitimate reasons – then it is permissible for the more distantly related guardian to do the marriage contract.\nBut if the social reasons have nothing to do with the impediments mentioned in Islamic teachings, then they carry no weight and it is not permissible to use that as an excuse to overlook the more closely related guardian and transgress his right to guardianship that Islam has granted to him.\nIf people need, for some reason, for the marriage contract to be done by a more distant relative, and the closer relative agrees to that, then the closer relative may appoint the more distant relative, or someone else who is qualified to do the marriage contract, as a proxy, even if he is not a guardian at all.\nThe scholars of the Permanent Committee were asked:\nSometimes a woman’s brother does the marriage contract for her, even if her father or grandfather is present, because he has delegated him to do that and has agreed to it. Is the marriage contract valid if it is done in this way? In other words, if a more distantly related guardian does the marriage contract even though a more closely related guardian is present, with his consent?\nThey replied:\nIf the more distantly related guardian of the woman does the marriage contract in the presence of the more closely related guardian, without a legitimate reason for the original guardian not to do it, and without him being appointed as a proxy by the more closely related guardian, then the marriage contract is invalid, and the marriage is not valid in this case, because he has no guardianship over the woman when the one who is entitled to guardianship, namely the more closely related guardian, is present.\nBut if the one who is entitled to do the marriage contract for the woman gives up the right to guardianship to one who is more distantly related than him, or he appoints as a proxy someone who is qualified to be a guardian to do the marriage contract for the woman under his care, it is permissible for him to do the marriage contract and the marriage is valid, because it is a right of his that he has given up to the one whom he has appointed as his proxy, so the latter takes his place.\nBased on that, it is permissible for the brother to do the marriage contract for his sister, if the guardian who is more entitled to do the marriage contract for her appointed him as his proxy and delegated him to do that.\nAnd Allah is the source of strength.

12338,I would like to know: my wife has gold jewelry which was given to her from mother but I am not well off and I am in debt also so how should I pay zakat on it?,"[""Praise be to Allah.Who pays Zakah on wife's gold?\nThe husband does not have to pay Zakah on the jewelry on his wife’s behalf, because the Zakah is only obligatory on the possessor of the wealth, and the possessor in this case is your wife, because she is the owner of the jewelry. So she has to pay Zakah on it, either from the jewelry itself or from its monetary value .\nIf her husband or someone else pays Zakah on her behalf with her permission, that is OK, and he will be rewarded for this voluntary action.\xa0\nCan the wife pay Zakah to her husband?\nIf the wife wants to give the Zakah on her jewelry or anything else to her husband who is in debt and cannot pay it off or who is poor, there is nothing wrong with that, because it comes under the general meaning of the verse (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“As-Sadaqat (here it means Zakah) are only for the poor, and the needy…” [At-Tawbah 9:60]\xa0\nIndeed, there is the hope that she will have a multiple reward, because of the Hadith narrated by Al-Bukhari (1466) and Muslim (1000) from Zaynab (may Allah be pleased with her), the wife of `Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: `Give in charity, O women, even if it is from your jewelry.’ I went back to `Abdullah and said, `You are a man who has little wealth, and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) has commanded us to give in charity. Go and ask him if that is acceptable, otherwise I will give my charity to someone else.’ `Abdullah said to me, `No, you go and ask him.’ So I went, and there I saw a woman from among the Ansar at the door of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), wanting to ask the same question. We felt too shy to speak to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Bilal came out to us and we said to him, `Go to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and tell him that there are two women at the door asking whether it is acceptable for them to give charity (Zakah) to their husbands and the orphans who are in their care, but do not tell him who we are.’ Bilal went in to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and asked him, and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked, `Who are they?’ He said, `A woman from among the Ansar and Zaynab.’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked, `Which Zaynab?’ He said, `The wife of `Abdullah.’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to him, ‘They will have two rewards, the reward of (upholding ties of) kinship and the reward of giving charity.’”\xa0\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “From this Hadith it may be understood that it is permissible for a woman to give Zakah to her husband. This is the view of Ash-Shafi`i, Ath-Thawri, the two companions of Abu Hanifah, one of the two reports narrated from Malik and from Ahmad.”\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12338/must-the-husband-pay-zakah-on-wifes-jewelry
