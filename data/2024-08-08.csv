466448,"I work in a pharmacy, and there are some medicines that are taken by addicts to use for wrongful purposes. When someone comes about whom I have doubts, I lie to him and say that it is not available. Am I sinning for telling this lie? But I am concerned about two things: firstly, that I am giving him the medicine to which he is addicted, so I will have helped someone to take drugs, or if I withhold it from him and he is actually sick, then I will have withheld his medicine from him.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe medicines that are sold in pharmacies are of two types:\n-1-\nThose which the health authorities have classified as narcotics. They are not to be sold except with a doctor’s prescription, and it is not permissible for the doctor to prescribe them except in the case of extreme need, when there is no permissible alternative available.\nThe scholars of the Permanent Committee for Ifta’ were asked:\nWhat is the ruling on using pethidine or morphine, which are drugs with a narcotic effect, in the case of necessity or when needed?\nThey replied: If no other permissible medication is known that could be used to alleviate the patient’s pain except these two medications, it is permissible to use either of them to alleviate pain when necessary. That is so long as no greater or equal harm could result from using them, such as becoming addicted to using them.\nShaykh ‘Abd al-Aziz ibn Baz, Shaykh ‘Abd ar-Razzaq ‘Afifi, Shaykh ‘Abdullah ibn Ghadyan, Shaykh ‘Abdullah ibn Qa‘ud\nEnd quote from Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah (25/77-78).\n-2-\nThose which are not classified as narcotic. In principle, it is permissible to sell them, unless it is known or thought most likely that the purchaser is buying it for some haram purpose, such as intoxication or getting high, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And cooperate in righteousness and piety, but do not cooperate in sin and transgression. And fear Allah; indeed, Allah is severe in penalty}\xa0[al-Ma’idah 5:2].\nSo if you think it most likely that someone is buying the medicine because he is addicted to it, then you should not sell it to him unless he has a doctor’s prescription.\nSecondly:\nIt is haram to lie except in the case of necessity or in situations in which Islamic teaching grants a concession.\nThe way out in this case is to use a double entendre. So, for example, you could say, “It is not available,” intending that it is not available to you, or to someone who does not have a doctor’s prescription. Or you could say, “It is not there,” meaning that it is not there on a certain shelf or in a certain section, where this medicine is not usually found.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: You should note that what is meant by a double entendre is saying words of which there is an apparent meaning, but you intend another meaning to which these words could also apply, that is different from the apparent meaning. This is a kind of cheating and deceiving. The scholars said that if there is a legitimate purpose to be served that outweighs the sin of deceit, or meets a need that cannot be met except by lying, then there is nothing wrong with using a double entendre. But if that is not the case, then it is disliked, although it is not prohibited, unless it is used as a means to acquire the wealth of others unlawfully or deny them their rights. In that case it is prohibited. This is the guideline regarding this matter.""(Al-Adhkaar, p. 380).\nSee also the answer to question no. 27261 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/466448/what-is-the-ruling-on-a-pharmacist-selling-medicine-when-he-thinks-it-most-likely-that-the-purchaser-is-going-to-use-it-as-a-drug-or-is-addicted-to-it
259154,"If we say “La ilaha ill-Allah wahdahu la sharika lah, lahu`l-mulk wa lahu`l-hamd wa huwa `ala kulli shay`in qadir (there is no god worthy of worship except Allah alone, with no partner or associate. His is the Dominion and to Him be praise, and He is able to do all things)” one hundred times at scattered intervals, will we attain the reward as is mentioned in this Hadith: “Whoever says `La ilaha illallah wahdahu la sharika lah, lahu`l-mulk wa lahu`l-hamd wa huwa `ala kulli shay`in qadir` one hundred times in a day, will have (a reward) equivalent to freeing ten slaves, one hundred hasanat (good deeds) will be recorded for him and one hundred sayyi`at (bad deeds) will be erased from him, and he will be protected from the Shaytan for that day until evening comes. No one can do anything better than what he has done except one who does more than that”? Can we reconcile between the above Hadith and the Hadith: “Whoever frees a Muslim slave, Allah will ransom each of his limbs from the Fire for each of (the slave`s) limbs, even his private part for (the slave`s) private part”?","['Praise be to Allah.The reward for saying `La ilaha illallah wahdahu la sharika lah…`\nAl-Bukhari (3292) and Muslim (2691) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever says, `La ilaha illallah  wahdahu la sharika lah, lahu’l-mulk wa lahu’l-hamd wa huwa `ala kulli shay`in qadir\xa0(there is no god worthy of worship except Allah alone, with no partner or associate. His is the Dominion and to Him be praise, and He is able to do all things)’ one hundred times in a day, will have (a reward) equivalent to freeing ten slaves, one hundred Hasanat (good deeds) will be recorded for him and one hundred Sayyi’at (bad deeds) will be erased from him, and he will be protected from the devil for that day until evening comes. No one can do anything better than what he has done except one who does more than that.”\nThere is no stipulation in the Hadith that the Dhikr mentioned should be repeated one hundred times consecutively in order to attain this virtue. What appears to be the case is that the matter is broad in scope, and that the criterion for attaining this reward is that it should be done all on the same day, not that it should be done consecutively.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe general meaning of the Hadith indicates that the reward mentioned may be attained by the one who repeats this Dhikr one hundred times in a day , whether he repeats it consecutively or at different times in several sessions, or he recites some of it at the beginning of the day and some at the end of the day. But the best is to recite it consecutively at the beginning of the day, so that it will be a protection for him throughout his day."" (Sharh An-Nawawi `ala Muslim,\xa0 17/17)\nHadiths which encourage and urge Muslims to free slaves\xa0\nThere are Hadiths from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) which encourage and urge Muslims to free slaves, one of which is that which was narrated by Al-Bukhari (6715) and Muslim (1509) from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever frees a Muslim slave, Allah will ransom each of his limbs from the Fire for each of (the slave’s) limbs, even his private part for (the slave’s) private part.”\nAhmad (15417) narrated from Sahl ibn Hunayf, from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that whoever helps a Mukatab [a slave who has a contract of manumission with his master] to buy his freedom, Allah will shade him with His shade on the Day when there will be no shade except His shade.\nThere is no contradiction between the two Hadiths at all, such that we might seek to reconcile between them. Rather the Hadith which speaks of the virtue of this Dhikr says that for the one who says “La ilaha illallah  wahdahu la sharika lah, lahu’l-mulk wa lahu’l-hamd wa huwa `ala kulli shay’in qadir” one hundred times in a day there is the hope of reward, virtue and ransom from the Fire, just as there is the same hope for the one who liberates a Muslim slave from enslavement. This was stated clearly by Al-Qadi `Iyad (may Allah have mercy on him). (See:\xa0Sharh An-Nawawi `ala Muslim,\xa017/18)\nThere is nothing in the Hadith itself to explain what is hoped for the one who ransoms a Muslim slave.\nRather that is mentioned in the other Hadith, which states that for each limb of the liberated slave, Allah will ransom from the Fire one limb of the body of the one who ransomed him. The grace of Allah is vast and His generosity is immense.\nIbn Rajab said:\n“The one who understands the true meaning of Tawhid will be motivated to free slaves, and freeing slaves will be rewarded with ransom from the Fire, as it is proven in\xa0Al-Bukhari and Muslim\xa0that the one who says this Dhikr one hundred times will have (a reward) equivalent to freeing ten slaves.\nIt is also proven that the one who says this Dhikr ten times will be like the one who manumitted four of the descendants of Isma`il.\nIn\xa0Sunan Abu Dawud\xa0and elsewhere it is narrated from Anas that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever says in the morning and the afternoon: `Allahumma inni asbahtu ushhiduka wa ushhidu hamalata `arshika wa mala’ikataka wa jamee‘a khalqika annaka anta Allahu la ilaha illa anta wa anna Muhammadan `abduka wa rasuluka\xa0(O Allah, on this morning and I call upon You and I call upon the bearers of Your Throne, Your angels and all of Your creation to bear witness that You are Allah, there is no god worthy of worship except You, and that Muhammad is Your slave and Your Messenger),’ Allah will ransom one quarter of him from the Fire. Whoever says it twice, Allah will ransom half of him from the Fire; whoever says it three times, Allah will ransom three quarters of him from the Fire; and whoever says it four times, Allah will ransom him from the Fire.” (Lata’if Al-Ma`arif\xa0p. 283)\nThis immense virtue should motivate one to be keen to do more good, and should deter one from being lethargic or too lazy to do acts of worship and obedience or from wondering about this reward and virtue and thinking that it is unlikely.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/259154/the-reward-for-saying-la-ilaha-ill-allah-wahdahu-la-sharika-lah
194052,There is a factory that produces chicken and pork. What is the ruling on eating the chicken from this factory – is it halal?,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIn order for chicken and other meats to be halal, there are two conditions:\nThe first condition:\nThe slaughterer must be qualified, meaning that he should be a Muslim or one of the People of the Book, i.e., a Jew or a Christian). Meat slaughtered by an idol-worshipper, atheist or apostate is not permissible.\nThe second condition:\nThe chicken should be slaughtered in a place for slaughter, and it should not be killed by means of an electric shock, beating or drowning in water, because that is prohibited in the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Prohibited to you are dead animals,\xa0blood, the flesh of swine, and that which has been dedicated to other than Allah, and [those animals] killed by strangling or by a violent blow or by a head-long fall or by the goring of horns, and those from which a wild animal has eaten, except what you [are able to] slaughter [before its death], and those which are sacrificed on stone altars}\xa0[al-Ma’idah 5:3].\nAl-Hajjawi said in al-Iqna‘ (4/316): There are several conditions that are stipulated for slaughter:\n1.. The slaughterer should be qualified, which means that he should be of sound mind and intending to slaughter the animal in the proper manner. He should be a Muslim or one of the People of the Book (i.e., a Jew or a Christian), even if he is one whose people are in a state of war with the Muslims or one of the Christians of Banu Taghlib; male or female, free or slave, even if he or she is junub, menstruating, bleeding following childbirth or blind, of good character or otherwise.\nIt is more appropriate if the slaughterer is a Muslim rather than a Jew or a Christian.\nMeat is not permissible if it is slaughtered by a person one of whose parents is a disbeliever who is not one of the People of the Book. Meat is also not permissible if it is slaughtered by an apostate, even if he joined the religion of the People of the Book; or if it is slaughtered by a Zoroastrian, an idol worshipper or a heretic. The same applies to the Druze, the Isma‘ilis and the Nusayris of Syria…\n2.. The tool used for slaughter should be sharp, cutting and penetrating by virtue of its sharpness, not its weight, whether it is made of iron, stone, wood, reeds, bone or anything else, except teeth and nails…\n3.. The throat – meaning the windpipe – and the oesophagus – which is the passage for food and drink – must be cut, but if they are cut completely, that is better.\nThe more correct view is that it is not stipulated to cut the veins on both sides of the throat, but it is better to cut them. End quote.\nSecondly\nIf the factory produces pork products, and also produces chicken products, the matter is subject to further discussion:\n1.. If it produces whole chickens or parts such as legs and breasts, and the one in charge of slaughter is a Muslim, or a Jew or a Christian, then there is nothing wrong with buying chicken from them, because it is most likely that the chicken is not mixed with the pork, and the tools used for slaughter are kept separate.\n2.. But if it produces ground chicken meat or canned chicken meat, if it is known that the same equipment is used to produce pork products, then it is haram to eat this chicken, because it is impure as a result of using equipment that is contaminated with pork, unless it is possible to wash it and purify it, in which case the chicken is permissible.\nUndoubtedly it is better to completely avoid chicken that is produced in factories like this which also produce pork products, especially if we cannot find out what they really do in the factory, and the supervising authorities are not certain about their slaughtering procedures and the extent to which they adhere to Islamic rulings on slaughter.\nThe scholars of the Permanent Committee were asked:\nSome restaurants grill beef on the same hotplate as pork. Is it permissible to eat that meat? Similarly, they use the same knife to cut the meat.\nThey replied: It is not permissible to eat beef that is grilled on the same hotplate as pork. The same applies to the knife.""(Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah\xa0 22/285).\nThey were also asked:\nSometimes I eat in the student restaurant. Of course I avoid haram foods, but sometimes I order fried potato or fried eggs, and one time I saw the woman who cooks the food frying eggs in the same oil with meat. I do not know what the meat was, but I am almost certain that it was pork. Is it haram to eat the eggs and potatoes?\nThey replied: If you are certain that some food is fried in the same ghee or oil in which pork was fried before, then do not eat it, otherwise it is permissible for you to eat it.""(Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah\xa022/283).\nFor more information, please see the answers to questions no.\xa0148426 \xa0and\xa062839 \xa0.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/194052/is-it-permissible-to-buy-chicken-from-a-factory-that-produces-pork
76115,Does touching a non-mahram woman invalidate wudu? Please mention the different scholarly opinions on that.,"['Praise be to Allah.The scholars differed as to whether Wudu is invalidated by touching a woman . There are three views:\xa0\n\nThe first view is that touching a woman invalidates Wudu in all cases, whether the touching is with desire or not, and whether he intended to do that or it happened by mistake. This is the view of Imam Ash-Shafi`i (may Allah have mercy on him).\xa0\n\nHe quoted as evidence the verse (interpretation of the meaning): “or you have been in contact with [Lamastum] women” [An-Nisa’ 4:43].\xa0\nThe basic meaning of the word lamas (translated here as “been in contact with”) is touching with the hand.\xa0\nThe word “Lamas” appears in Hadiths with the meaning of touching with the hand, as in the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to Ma’iz (may Allah be pleased with him): “Perhaps you kissed her or touched (Lamasta) her.” (Narrated by Ahmad in Al-Musnad, 2130)\xa0\nAnd he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The Zina of the hand is touching (Al-lams).” (Narrated by Ahmad, 8392 and classed as authentic by Al-Albani in As-Silsilah As-Sahihah, 8204).\xa0\nBut these Hadiths indicate that what is meant by touching is that which is less than intercourse, and there is no dispute concerning this. Rather the dispute is whether the “touching” mentioned in the verse refers to intercourse or that which is less than it. These Hadiths do not refer to any such thing. \xa0\nThis opinion is the weakest of the scholarly views on this matter. Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said, as is mentioned in Al-Ikhtiyarat (p. 18): “If he touches a woman without desire, then it is well known that the Lawgiver does not require him to do Wudu and it is not recommended for him to do Wudu.”\xa0\n\nThe second view is that touching a woman does not invalidate Wudu  at all, whether it is with desire or without desire. This is the view of Imam Abu Hanifah (may Allah have mercy on him).\xa0\n\nThis view is indicated by a number of things:\xa0\n\nThe basic principle is that purity (Taharah) remains valid and is not invalidated unless there is sound evidence that this thing invalidates Wudu, and there is no such evidence in this case. As for the verse, `e shall see below that what it refers to is intercourse, not just touching.\nIt was narrated that `A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: I used to sleep in front of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and my legs would be in the direction of his Qiblah. When he prostrated, he would poke me and I would draw my legs up and when he stood up I would stretch them out again. (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 382). In An-Nasa’i (166) it says with an authentic chain of narrators: until, when he wanted to pray Witr, he touched me with his leg.\nIt was also narrated that she (may Allah be pleased with her) said: I noticed that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was not in the bed one night, so I looked for him, and my hand fell on the sole of his foot. He was in the mosque, with his feet held upright, and he was saying, “O Allah, I seek refuge in Your pleasure from Your wrath, in Your forgiveness from Your punishment.” (Narrated by Muslim, 486). According to a report narrated by Al-Bayhaqi with an authentic chain of narrators: I started to reach out for him with my hand and my hand fell on his feet, and they were held upright and he was prostrating… It is also narrated by An-Nasa’i (169).\xa0\n\nThe apparent meaning of these Hadiths is undoubtedly that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) touched `A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) when he was praying, and if touching a woman invalidates Wudu then his Wudu and prayer would have been invalidated. The Shafi’is responded to these Hadiths with a weak argument, and said that perhaps it was from behind a barrier!\xa0\nAl-Shawkani said: This argument is far-fetched and it goes against the apparent meaning.\xa0\n\nIt was also narrated from her (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) kissed one of his wives, then he went out to pray and he did not do Wudu. (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 179 and classed as authentic by Ibn Jarir, Ibn ‘Abd Al-Barr and Az-Zayla`i, and by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud).\n\nIt was also classed as inauthentic by many, including Sufyan Ath-Thawri, Yahya ibn Sa`id Al-Qattan, Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Ad-Daraqutni, Al-Bayhaqi and An-Nawawi.\xa0\nIf this Hadith is authentic, then it is very clear evidence for this opinion. If it is inauthentic, then there is no need for it as there are the authentic Hadiths quoted above, and the principle still stands that purification remains valid, and there is no evidence that Wudu is invalidated by touching a woman.\xa0\n\nThe third view is that it depends.\xa0If the touching was done with desire, then it invalidates Wudu, and if it was not done with desire then it does not invalidate it. This is the view of the Malikis and Hanbalis. They tried to reconcile between the texts, namely the verse “or you have been in contact with [Lamastum] women” which\xa0 indicates that Wudu is invalidated by touching a woman in their opinion, and the Hadiths which were quoted as evidence by those who think that it does not invalidate Wudu.\xa0\n\nThis argument may be valid if the verse indicates that Wudu is invalidated by touching in general – which is their opinion, but the correct view is that what is referred to in the verse is intercourse, as was explained by `Abdullah ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him), a view which was favoured by Ibn Jarir. His Tafsir takes precedence over the Tafsir of others, because of the Du`a’ of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when he prayed for him and said: “O Allah, grant him understanding of the deen and teach him understanding (of the Qur’an).” (Narrated by Ahmad; it is also narrated in Al-Bukhari. It was classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Tahqiq At-Tahhawiyyah.\xa0See also: Mahasin Al-Ta’wil by Al-Qasimi, 5/172).\xa0\nIntercourse is referred to by the word mass (touching) in more than one verse. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“There is no sin on you, if you divorce women while yet you have not touched (had sexual relation with) them, nor appointed unto them their Mahr (bridal-money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage).” [Al-Baqarah 2:236]\xa0\n“And if you divorce them before you have touched (had a sexual relation with) them, and you have appointed unto them the Mahr (bridal-money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage), then pay half of that (Mahr).” [Al-Baqarah 2:237]\xa0\n“O you who believe! When you marry believing women, and then divorce them before you have sexual intercourse with them, no `Iddah [divorce prescribed period] have you to count in respect of them. So give them a present, and set them free (i.e. divorce) in a handsome manner.” [Al-Ahzab 33:49]\xa0\nMoreover, upon deeper study the verse does indicate this view (that what is meant by touching here is intercourse). The reason for that is:\xa0\n“That Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \xa0\n“O you who believe! When you intend to offer As-Salah (the prayer), wash your faces and your hands (forearms) up to the elbows, rub (by passing wet hands over) your heads, and (wash) your feet up to the ankles.” [Al-Ma’idah 5:6]\nThis refers to purification with water from minor impurity. Then He says (interpretation of the meaning): “But if you are ill or on a journey, or any of you comes after answering the call of nature, or you have been in contact with [lamastum]women (i.e. sexual intercourse), and you find no water, then perform Tayammum with clean earth”. The word Fatayammamu (perform Tayammum) is an alternative. The words “or any of you comes after answering the call of nature” refer to the cause for minor impurity and the words “or you have been in contact with [lamastum]women” refer to the cause for major impurity. \xa0\nIf we interpret “touching” as referring to touching with the hand, then the verse would mean that Allah mentioned two reasons for doing minor purification, and did not state any reason for doing major purification, even though He says “If you are in a state of Janaba (i.e. after a sexual discharge), purify yourselves (bathe your whole body)”. This is incompatible with the eloquence of the Qur’an.\xa0\nBased on this, the verse indicates that what is meant by “or you have been in contact with [lamastum] women” is: if you have had intercourse, so Allah mentions the two reasons that make it obligatory to purify oneself.” (Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti`, 1/240)\xa0(See also: Al-Bada’i` was-Sana’i`, 1/132; Al-Fiqh Al-Maliki, 1/89; and Al-Majmu`, 2/21)\nThe most correct of these three views is the second one, that touching a woman does not invalidate Wudu at all, whether it is with desire or without desire.\xa0\nThis is the view favoured by Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (12/222), and among contemporary scholars by Shaykh Ibn Baz (10/134), Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (1/286) and the scholars of the Standing Committee (5/266).\nFor more, see these answers: 12801 , 82759 , 8531 , 21242 , and 191686 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/76115/does-touching-a-woman-invalidate-wudu
