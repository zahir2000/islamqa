272059,"There is a woman in her forties whose younger brother, who is thirty years old, did her marriage contract without the knowledge of her older brother, who is fifty years old, and her father is deceased. Is the marriage contract valid, or is it not valid unless the guardian is the older brother?","['Praise be to Allah.In order for the marriage to be valid, the marriage contract should be done by the woman’s guardian or his proxy, in the presence of two male, Muslim witnesses, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no [valid] marriage without a guardian.” Narrated by Abu Dawud (2085), at-Tirmidhi (1101) and Ibn Majah (1881) from Abu Musa al-Ash‘ari; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih at-Tirmidhi. And he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There can be no [valid] marriage except with a guardian and two witnesses of good character.” Narrated by al-Bayhaqi from ‘Imran and ‘A’ishah; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami‘, no. 7557.\nThe woman’s guardian is her father, then his father, then her son, then his son (if she has a son), then her brother through both parents, then her brother through her father only, then their sons, then her paternal uncles, then their sons, then the paternal uncles of her father, then the ruler. See: al-Mughni (9/355).\nBased on that:\nIf the father and grandfather of the woman are both deceased, and she has no adult son, then guardianship passes to her full brothers.\nSecondly: if the guardians are equal in their degree of kinship, such as full brothers, then the jurists differed as to which of them takes precedence with regard to guardianship. Some of them said that the one who is most entitled to it is the best of them in terms of knowledge and religious commitment; if they are equal in that, then the older one takes precedence, and if they argue and compete, then they should draw lots. This is the view of the Shafa‘is and Hanbalis.\nSome of them said that the best of them [in terms of knowledge and religious commitment] should take precedence, and if they compete, then the judge should decide which of them takes precedence. If there is no judge, then they should draw lots.\nAccording to either view, if she appoints one of them, then guardianship belongs to him.\nIf one of them goes ahead and arranges her marriage, with her consent, her marriage is valid, even if he is the youngest of his brothers, so long as he is an adult, whether the other brothers are aware of that or not.\nAl-Khatib ash-Sharbini ash-Shafa‘i said in Mughni al-Muhtaj (4/265): If the guardians are the same in degree of kinship, such as full brothers, or brothers through the father, or paternal uncles, and she gives permission to all of them, or she says: I give permission to do the marriage contract for me with So-and-so, then whoever among you wants to may give me in marriage to him, then it is recommended (mustahabb) that the one who has greater knowledge regarding the issue of marriage should do her marriage contract, because he has more knowledge of the conditions thereof. The next in order of precedence is the most pious of them, as it says in ar-Rawdah, because he is more compassionate and more keen to make sure that the suitor is a good choice. After him comes the oldest, because he has more experience of life, if that is with the consent of the others, so that they will all agree and so that no one will get upset because another dealt with the matter on their own.\nIf one who is less qualified gives her in marriage with her consent to a compatible suitor, that is valid, and the others should not object. End quote.\nAl-Bahuti al-Hanbali said in Kashshaf al-Qina‘ (5/58): If two or more guardians of the woman are equal in degree of kinship, such as her brothers from both parents or through the father, or paternal uncles, or sons of her brothers, if she gives permission to one of them, then he is the one who should represent her in the marriage contract, and it is not valid for anyone else, to whom she did not give permission, to do the marriage contract for her, because he does not have permission. If she gives permission to all of them and one of them gives her in marriage, it is valid for any of them to give her in marriage, because each of them is a valid guardian.\nBut the best is to give precedence to the most virtuous among those who are equal in terms of knowledge and religious commitment. Then if they are equal in terms of knowledge and religious commitment, precedence should be given to the oldest of them. End quote.\nIn Hashiyat ad-Dasuqi by al-Maliki (2/233), it says: If she appoints one of her brothers, for example, then the other brothers have no right to interfere in the matter or to compete with him. End quote.\nThus it becomes clear that the marriage is valid.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/272059/if-a-womans-guardians-for-the-purpose-of-marriage-are-of-equal-standing-who-takes-precedence
50180,"When is it permissible for a sick person to pray sitting down, because he may be able to stand but with great difficulty?","['Praise be to Allah.Is standing a pillar of prayer?\nIn the answer to question no\xa050684 \xa0we have stated that standing is a pillar or essential part of the obligatory prayers, so the prayer of one who prays sitting when he is able to stand is not valid. But like all other obligatory duties, this may be waived in the case of inability to do it.\xa0\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Majmu` (4/201):\xa0\n“The Ummah unanimously agreed that whoever is unable to stand in an obligatory prayer may pray sitting down, and he does not have to repeat the prayer. Our companions said: his reward will not be less than the reward for offering the prayer standing up, because he is excused. It was proven in Sahih Al-Bukhari that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If a person is sick or is travelling, the reward of what he used to do when he was healthy and not travelling with be written for him.”” \xa0\nExcuses which allow praying sitting down\nThe guidelines for the excuse which allows one not to stand and to offer obligatory prayers sitting down , are as follows:\xa0\n\nThat he be unable to stand\nThat it will make his sickness worse\nThat it will delay his recovery\nThat it should cause great difficulty of such a scale that he will be unable to focus properly. If the difficulty caused is less than that, then it is not permissible for him to sit.\n\nAl-Bukhari (1117) narrated that `Imran ibn Husayn (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I had haemorrhoids and I asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about praying. He said: “Pray standing, and if you cannot, then whilst sitting, and if you cannot, then whilst lying on your side.”\xa0\nAl-Hafidh (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The words “If you cannot” were quoted as evidence by those who say that a sick person should not start to sit whilst praying until after he becomes unable to stand. This was narrated by `Iyad from Ash-Shafi`i. It was narrated from Malik, Ahmad and Is-Haq that it is not essential that a person be unable to stand, rather if it is very difficult for him to stand (then he may sit).\xa0\nThe well-known view among the Shafi`is is that what is meant by not being able is that it is very difficult to stand, or there is the fear that the sickness may be made worse or it may lead to the death of the patient. Slight difficulty is not sufficient (as an excuse ). Another example of great hardship is dizziness in the case of a passenger on a boat who fears that he may drown if he prays standing in the boat.\xa0\nThe majority also quote as evidence the hadith of Ibn ‘Abbas which was narrated by At-Tabarani (may Allah have mercy on him): “He should pray standing, but if he encounters difficulty then sitting, and if he encounters difficulty, then lying down.”” (Fat-h Al-Bari)\xa0\nThe Hadith of Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) which was mentioned by Al-Hafidh was also quoted by Al-Haythami in Majma` Al-Zawa’id, 2897, where he says:\xa0\n“This was narrated by At-Tabarani in Al-Awsat. He said: It was not narrated from Ibn Jurayj except by Halas ibn Muhammad Al-Dab’i. I (Al-Haythami) say: I cannot find anyone who wrote his biography, but the rest of the men in its chain of narrators are trustworthy.”\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Mughni, 1/443:\xa0\n“If he is able to stand (he should do so), otherwise if he fears that his sickness will become worse or his recovery will be slowed or it is extremely difficult for him to stand, then he may pray sitting down. Something similar was said by Malik and Ishaq… because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“and has not laid upon you in religion any hardship” [Al-Hajj 22:78]\xa0\nThe obligation of standing in this case is a hardship.\xa0\nAnd the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prayed sitting down when he was wounded in his right cheek; it seems that he was not completely unable to stand, but because it was difficult for him to stand, he was excused.”\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Majmu`, 4/201:\n“Our companions said: Being unable does not necessarily mean that one cannot stand and slight difficulty is not enough reason for not standing; rather what counts is obvious difficulty. If a person fears immense hardship or worsening of the sickness etc., or if a passenger in a boat fears that he may drown or become dizzy, he may pray sitting down, and he does not have to repeat the prayer. Imam Al-Haramayn said: What I think with regard to the guidelines on what constitutes an inability to stand is that standing would cause hardship that would prevent him from focusing properly, because proper focus is the purpose of prayer.”\nThe view favoured by Imam Al-Haramayn (may Allah have mercy on him) is the view which Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) thought most likely to be correct. He said: \xa0\n“The guideline on what constitutes hardship is that which prevents one from focusing properly. Proper focus means having presence of mind and being at ease. If standing will cause intense anxiety which makes one ill at ease and makes him wish to reach the end of Al-Fatihah quickly so that he can bow, because it is too hard to stand, then he may pray sitting down.” (Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti’, 4/326.\nFor more details, please refer to the following answers: 142657 , 143720 , 226368 , and 115143 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/50180/can-i-pray-sitting-down-if-im-tired
476858,"My question is on family inheritance (a farmhouse with rented income) left by my paternal grandfather and grandmother who were blessed with 9 children, Their order of birth and number of their children (i.e. grandchildren) are defined below:","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe one who has the right to inherit from your grandfather is one who was alive at the time of your grandfather’s death. As for the one who died before your grandfather, he does not inherit, and his children are barred from inheriting by their paternal uncles.\nThe same applies to the estate of your grandmother; no one can inherit from her except those who were alive at the time when she died.\nIt says in al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (3/22): There are three conditions for inheriting:\n-1-\nAscertaining that the testator has indeed died or is legally presumed dead, as in the case of one who is missing, if the judge rules that he is to be presumed dead; or is expected to have died, as in the case of a foetus who is miscarried due to an attack on the mother for which the attacker is liable.\n-2-\nAscertaining that the heir was still alive after the death of the testator or he is deemed to still be alive, as in the case of a pregnancy in which the foetus was\xa0 delivered alive and remained stable up to the time when it was ascertained that he was alive at the time of the testator’s death.\n-3-\nKnowing the reason why someone is entitled to inheritance, such as being a spouse, blood relative or connected to the testator through wala’. The type of relationship should be known, such as being a child, father, mother, brother, or paternal uncle. And the degree of the relationship which connects the testator to the heir should be known. End quote.\nSee: adh-Dhakhirah by al-Qarafi (13/6); Mughni al-Muhtaj (4/10); Kashshaf al-Qina‘ (4/404).\nBased on that, the following do not inherit from your grandfather: the children of Aunty #3, because she died before her father.\nAnd the following do not inherit from your grandmother: the children of Aunty #3 and the children of Uncle #7, and you and your two sisters, because your fathers died before their mother.\nSecondly:\nThose who inherit from your grandfather are all of them except the children of Aunty #3.\nRegarding how his estate is to be divided, we may say:\nHe died and left behind a wife, three sons and five daughters.\nThe wife gets one eighth, and the rest is to be divided between the eight children, with each male getting the share of two females.\nIf any of them dies, his share passes to his children.\nSo when dividing the estate, it should be divided into 88 equal parts.\nThe share of the wife will be: the estate x 11 ÷ 88\nThe share of each male: the estate x 14 ÷ 88\nThe share of each female: the estate x 7 ÷ 88.\nThirdly:\nThose who inherit from your grandmother are the rest of her children except Aunty #3 and Uncle #7, and your father.\nThe way to divide her estate is as follows:\nShe died and left behind one son (Uncle #1) and five daughters.\nThe estate is to be divided between them, with the male getting the share of two females. So it should be divided into seven shares, of which the son gets two shares, which his children take, and each daughter gets one share.\nFourthly:\nIf all the heirs agreed not to divide the estate, there is nothing wrong with that, and in that case the income from the farm is to be divided among them according to the shares of inheritance, unless some of them forfeit their share and they are adults of sound mind, in which case there is nothing wrong with that.\nIf someone demands his share of the inheritance at any time, he has the right to do that. So he should either be given his share, or the others should buy it from him, giving him its price, or the farm may be sold and its price divided among them. It is not permissible to delay giving to the one who wants to take his share.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/476858/he-died-and-left-behind-a-wife-and-children-some-of-his-children-died-during-his-lifetime-and-some-died-before-his-wife-died-how-should-the-estate-of-the-spouses-be-divided
129409,Does laughing invalidate Wudu even though the person is not actually praying; rather he is getting ready to pray?,"['Praise be to Allah.Does laughing break Wudu?\nThere is no difference of opinion among the scholars that laughing outside of prayer – even when one is getting ready for prayer – does not invalidate Wudu.\nIbn Al-Mundhir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The scholars unanimously agreed that laughing outside of prayer does not invalidate Wudu and does not require one to do Wudu again.” (Al-Awsat, 1/166)\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “They [the scholars] unanimously agreed that laughing out loud outside of prayer does not invalidate Wudu.” (Al-Majmu`, 2/61)\nDoes laughing invalidate prayer?\nThe scholars unanimously agreed that laughing when praying invalidates the prayer .\nIbn Al-Mundhir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “They unanimously agreed that laughing when praying invalidates the prayer.” (Al-Ijma`, p. 3)\nWhat is meant by laughing here is laughing out loud\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “We do not know of any difference of opinion concerning that.” (Al-Mughni, 2/451)\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Laughing out loud, in which one makes a loud noise, is contrary to the dignity of prayer and to the focus and humility that is required in prayer. Moreover, it shows disrespect towards the prayer, makes a mockery of it and is contrary to its purpose, so the prayer is spoiled by that.” (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 22/617)\nDoes laughing out loud in prayer break your Wudu?\nFrom the above, it is clear that the difference of opinion among the scholars has to do with laughing out loud in the prayer and whether Wudu is also invalidated by it, or not.\nThe correct view, which is that of the majority of scholars, is that it does not invalidate Wudu, because there is no evidence to indicate that it does invalidate it.\nJabir ibn `Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “If someone laughs whilst praying, he must repeat his prayer, but he does not have to repeat Wudu”. (Narrated by Ad-Daraqutni, 51 and by Al-Bukhari in a Mu‘allaq report)\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “It is proven to be authentic, but it is the words of Jabir.” (Fat-h Al-Bari, 1/280)\nShaykh Al-Islam (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “There is no narration from any Companion to suggest a different view.
