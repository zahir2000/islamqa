509261,"My friend developed an app called Raudhatul Mahabbah.The app as he claims “aims to increase the love of the Prophet in peoples hearts.” The app itself comprises of the following:on Thursday a person sets his target of how many times he wants to do salawat on the Prophet on Friday.Then on Friday the person writes his achievement.Since this app is used by many people,a computer adds totals of all people and then gives the people their totals by percentage.My Question is,is this similar tp the hadith of Ibn Masud and the circle of dhikr,is it an innovation,or is it something praiseworthy?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nSending blessings upon the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is one of the noblest acts of worship that may bring one closer to Allah. It is more emphasized at certain times, including Friday and the night before Friday, because of the report narrated by Ahmad (16162), Abu Dawud (1531), an-Nasa’i (1734) and Ibn Majah (1085) from Aws ibn Aws, who said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “One of the best of your days is Friday. So send a great deal of blessings upon me on that day, for your blessings will be shown to me.” They said, O Messenger of Allah, how will our blessings be shown to you when you will have disintegrated? He said, “Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, has forbidden the earth to consume the bodies of the Prophets.” Classed as sahih by al-Albani and Shu‘ayb al-Arna’ut.\nAl-Bayhaqi narrated in as-Sunan in a report from Anas which was attributed to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “Send a great deal of blessings upon me on Friday and the night before Friday, for whoever sends blessings upon me, Allah will send blessings upon him tenfold.” Classed as hasan by al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami‘, no. 545, and in as-Sahihah (1407).\nSecondly:\nThere is nothing wrong with making an app to remind you to send blessings upon the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on Friday, and there is nothing wrong with setting a target and hoping to meet this target number of sending blessings, on condition that you do not believe that there is any particular virtue in this number; rather the intention is to encourage yourself. So you may resolve to send blessings upon him one thousand times, for example, or two thousand times, or more or less than that.\nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 88102 .\nThirdly:\nThere is nothing wrong with the app showing the number of people who are sending blessings upon the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and the total number of times they have done that, and giving the people their totals by percentage – meaning that it shows a comparison between participants, without displaying their names – and the like, because there are no shar‘i reservations regarding that, as it encourages people and makes them want to do better in sending blessings upon the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nOne of the things to watch out for in this matter is that if people know that a particular person recited such and such a number of blessings on the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), that may lead to self-admiration or showing off, which could render his good deed invalid.\nAs for the example mentioned, we do not see anything wrong with it. However, the one who uses this app should only use it sometimes, and not at other times or many times, so that his motivation will not be to see the number of blessings he recited shown on the screen or to meet the target that he set on the app. That is because this could impact his good deeds, or create a condition in his mind, such that his dhikr and blessings upon the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) will be connected to the app and the target it has set, even if he does not realize that and is not aware of it. This is a serious negative result of using these apps and the like.\nOnce he has trained himself to send blessings upon the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and he has made that a regular part of his dhikr which he does not usually forget, then he should do that by himself for himself, and stop using the app.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/509261/what-is-the-ruling-on-subscribing-to-an-app-which-lets-you-set-a-target-number-of-times-to-send-blessings-upon-the-prophet-blessings-and-peace-of-allah-be-upon-him-on-friday
104215,When should we dust off the bed three times? Is it before sleeping or after? How should it be done?,"['Praise be to Allah.Al-Bukhari (6320) and Muslim (2714) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When one of you goes to his bed, let him dust off his bed with the inside of his lower garment, for he does not know what came onto it after he left it. Then let him say: Bismika Rabbi wada`tu janbi wa bika arfa`uhu wa in amsakta nafsi farhamha wa in arsaltaha fahfadh-ha bima tahfadhu bihi `ibadika As-salihin ( In Your name, my Lord, I lie down, and in Your name I rise. If You should take my soul then have mercy on it, and if You should return my soul then protect it as You protect Your righteous slaves).”\xa0\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Sharh Muslim:\n“The inside of his lower garment” means its edge. What is meant is that it is recommended to dust down his bed before lying on it, lest there be a snake or scorpion or other harmful thing in it. And he should dust it down with his hand covered by the edge of his lower garment, lest something bad happen to his hand if there is anything there.”\xa0\nHence it is known that dusting down the bed is to be done when one wants to sleep, and it may be done with the edge of one’s garment or something else.\xa0\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 21216 , 30784 , 145543 , 72591 , 21647 ,\xa0 and 50010 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/104215/is-dusting-the-bed-before-sleeping-sunnah
495596,"If the wife’s daughter has a daughter through breastfeeding, is the mother’s husband a mahram to this daughter?","['Praise be to Allah.If a man marries a woman and consummates the marriage with her, if she has a daughter from another man, who is a stepdaughter (rabibah), this stepdaughter becomes a mahram for him [meaning that she is forbidden for him to marry] according to the text of the verse.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Prohibited to you [for marriage] are your mothers, your daughters, your sisters, your father\'s sisters, your mother\'s sisters, your brother\'s daughters, your sister\'s daughters, your [milk] mothers who nursed you, your sisters through nursing, your wives\' mothers, and your step-daughters under your guardianship [born] of your wives unto whom you have gone in. But if you have not gone in unto them, there is no sin upon you}\xa0[an-Nisa’ 4:23].\nThis prohibition also includes the daughter of this stepdaughter.\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nStepdaughters who are under the guardianship of husbands are prohibited for marriage. They are the daughters of their wives with whom they have consummated marriage. That also includes their daughters, their daughters’ daughters and sons’ daughters; they are all included in the word stepdaughters (raba’ib).""(Zad al-Ma‘ad 5/168).\nIt says in al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah al-Kuwaitiyyah (36/216):\nRaba’ib (stepdaughters) is the plural of rabibah. The stepchild of a man is the child of his wife from another man. The stepchild is called his rabib because he is the one who raises him (yurubbuhu), meaning that he takes care of him. The stepdaughter (rabibah) is the daughter of the wife, and she is prohibited for her mother’s husband to marry according to the verse, whether she is under his guardianship or not, and she is looked after like his own daughter in terms of compassion and care. With regard to the daughters of the stepdaughter and the daughters of the stepson being mahrams [and prohibited for marriage], that is established by scholarly consensus. End quote.\nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 163263 .\nAs the stepdaughter becomes a mahram to her mother’s husband because of ties through marriage, the daughter of the stepdaughter becomes a mahram to him because of lineage and the ties of kinship between her and her mother.\nShe also becomes a mahram to him if motherhood is not because of lineage and giving birth, rather it is because of breastfeeding, because of the general meaning of the text which indicates that what becomes mahram (forbidden for marriage) through breastfeeding is the same as that which becomes mahram through ties of kinship.\nAccording to the hadith, Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said regarding the daughter of Hamzah: “She is not permissible for me (to marry), for what becomes mahram (forbidden for marriage) through breastfeeding is the same as that which becomes mahram through lineage, and she is the daughter of my brother through breastfeeding.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (2645) and Muslim (1447).\nAl-Bukhari (5099) and Muslim (1444) narrated from ‘Amrah bint ‘Abd ar-Rahman that ‘A’ishah, the wife of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), told her that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was in her house, and she heard the voice of a man asking permission to enter Hafsah’s house. ‘A’ishah said: I said: O Messenger of Allah, there is a man asking permission to enter your house. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “I think it is So and so” – Hafsah’s paternal uncle through breastfeeding. ‘A’ishah said: O Messenger of Allah, if So and so – her paternal uncle through breastfeeding – were still alive, could he enter my house? The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Yes, for what becomes mahram (forbidden for marriage) through breastfeeding is the same as that which becomes mahram through birth.”\nThe view that breastfeeding is equal to lineage when there is a connection through marriage is the view of the majority of scholars.\nIbn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe prohibition on marriage to a mahram through breastfeeding extends as far as the same prohibition through lineage when there is a connection through marriage, either with regard to the man’s lineage, such as the wife of his father or son, or with regard to the woman’s lineage, such as her mother and daughter, and with regard to women to whom it is prohibited to be married at the same time because of the women’s lineage also, such as being married to two sisters, or to a woman and her paternal aunt or her maternal aunt, at the same time. All of that becomes prohibited through breastfeeding as it becomes prohibited through lineage, because it is included in the Prophet’s words, “what becomes mahram (forbidden for marriage) through breastfeeding is the same as that which becomes mahram through lineage.”\nAll of that becomes prohibited because of lineage, and some of it is because of the husband’s lineage and some of it is because of the wife’s lineage. This was stated by the leading scholars of the early generations, and no difference of opinion is known to have occurred among them concerning that. It was also stated by Imam Ahmad, who quoted as evidence the general meaning of the Prophet’s words, “what becomes mahram (forbidden for marriage) through breastfeeding is the same as that which becomes mahram through lineage.”(Jami‘ al-‘Uloom wa’l-Hikam\xa0 2/442).\nThus the mahram relationship may be established through breastfeeding as it may also be established through lineage.\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe Prophet’s words, “Breastfeeding makes prohibited what birth makes prohibited” imply that breastfeeding also makes permissible what birth makes permissible, according to scholarly consensus. This has to do with the prohibition on marriage and other issues connected to it. The mahram relationship with the one who was breastfed includes the children of the woman who breastfed him, and they are to be viewed as being like close relatives with regard to it being permissible to look at them, be alone with them and travel with them, but that does not include other rulings on motherhood such as inheritance, the obligation to spend on maintenance, the obligation to manumit a relative if one finds him enslaved and buys him, and rulings on giving testimony, paying blood money and waiving retaliatory punishments (qisas).""(Fath al-Bari (9/141).\nShaykh al-Islam had a different view concerning that. He favoured the view that it does not make him a mahram. He said in al-Ikhtiyarat (p.305):\nThe daughter of a stepdaughter is a mahram (prohibited for marriage) because she is a stepdaughter.\nHe also said in al-Ikhtiyarat (p. 308).\nThe mahram relationship that is established through marriage cannot be established on the basis of breastfeeding, so it does not become prohibited for a man to marry his wife’s mother or daughter through breastfeeding. End quote.\nIn ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘ (12/124), Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) stated that the view of Ibn Taymiyah is more likely to be correct, but he took a prudent approach and said that the view of the majority should be followed.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/495596/if-his-stepdaughter-has-a-daughter-through-breastfeeding-is-he-a-mahram-to-her
115751,"I married a foreign woman after she became Muslim in a Shar`i marriage in accordance with the laws of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger, and I concealed from her the fact that I was married before.","['Praise be to Allah.It is not obligatory for the husband to tell the second wife that he is already married and this does not affect the validity of his marriage to her. So long as the marriage contract fulfils the necessary requirements and conditions, then it is valid.\xa0\nShaykh Ibn Jibrin (may Allah preserve him) was asked: Is it essential for the marriage to be valid that a man should inform the woman he wants to marry that he is married to another one, if he is not asked about that? Are there any consequences if he denies it if he is asked?\xa0\nHe replied:\xa0\n“The man is not obliged to tell the woman or her family that he is married if they do not ask him, but that cannot usually be hidden because marriage is not usually done except after a period of enquiring and asking about each of the two partners and verifying that they are suitable.\xa0\nBut it is not permissible to conceal any facts, and if either party tells a lie and the other party acts on the basis of it, then there is the option of cancelling it.\xa0\nIf he says that he is not married and is lying about that, then the woman has the option of annulling the marriage. If they say that she was a virgin when she is not, then he has the option of going ahead with the marriage or cancelling it.”\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 61 , 12544 , 175097 , and 91899 .\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/115751/do-you-have-to-tell-your-second-wife-that-you-are-married
