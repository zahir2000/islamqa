510568,"How should I give zakah on shares which I bought three years ago for the purpose of selling them, but I was not able to sell them, because I would not make any profit. I am waiting until they reach the purchase price or more, then I will sell them, in sha Allah.","['Praise be to Allah.If someone buys shares with the intention of selling them, then they are trade goods and are subject to zakah every year. So he should work out their value when one (Hijri) year has passed, then give one quarter of one tenth (2.5%) as zakah, whether the value has dropped below the purchase price or has risen.\nIf he does not have cash to give, he should work out the zakah that is due, then wait until he sells the shares, after which he must give what he owns.\nThe Permanent Committee was asked about real estate shares, which have remained for a long time with no increase in their value, and which may have fallen below the basic market value.\nThey replied: The shares mentioned in the question come under the heading of trade goods, so they are subject to zakah. Their value must be worked out every year, regardless of the purchase price. Then if the owner has money he should pay zakah from it, otherwise he should give zakah for past years after he sells them and receives payment for them.""(Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah\xa0 9/353).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Should zakah on shares be based on the official value of the share or on its market value, or what?\nHe replied: Zakah on shares and other trade goods should be based on the market value. So if at the time of purchase the value was one thousand, then it it has risen to two thousand at the time when zakah becomes due, the value should be regarded as being two thousand, because what matters is the value at the time when zakah becomes due, not the value at the time of purchase.""(Majmu‘ Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymin\xa018/197).\nFor more information, please see the answers to questions no. 231858 and 130487 .\nThe time for paying zakah on shares is the time for paying zakah on the cash with which you bought the shares, if the cash reached the minimum threshold (nisab). So if someone acquired cash which reached the minimum threshold, which is equivalent to 595 grams of silver, in Ramadan, then he bought shares with it in Dhu’l-Hijjah, the zakah year begins in Ramadan.\xa0\nIn Zad al-Mustaqni‘ p. 87, it says: If he bought trade goods with cash or other goods that reached the minimum threshold, then the zakah year for what he bought is the same as the zakah year for the wealth with which he purchased those goods.\nSo the minimum threshold for cash is: 595 x 3.66 = 21,777 riyals.\nIf the cash did not reach the minimum threshold, then the zakah year begins from when the value of the shares reached the minimum threshold.\nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 99400 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/510568/if-someone-buys-shares-with-the-intention-of-selling-them-then-their-value-drops-below-the-purchase-price-how-should-he-give-zakah-on-them
104805,"What are a daughter’s rights over her mother’s husband, and what are her duties? What are the man’s rights and duties regarding his stepdaughter?","['Praise be to Allah.Is a Stepfather Mahram?\nThe stepdaughter is the daughter of a wife from someone other than her current husband; she is permanently forbidden in marriage to the man if he has consummated his marriage with her mother. This means that she has become one of his Mahrams .\nIt says in Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah (17/367):\n“If a man marries a woman and consummates the marriage with her, it becomes permanently forbidden for him to marry one of her daughters or one of the daughters of her sons, no matter how far the line of descent extents, whether she is a daughter from a previous or subsequent husband, because Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted) says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Prohibited to you [for marriage] are your mothers… and your stepdaughters under your guardianship [born] of your wives unto whom you have gone in.} [An-Nisa’ 4:23]\nThe stepdaughter here is the wife’s daughter . A man is regarded as a Mahram of the daughters of a woman whom he marries and with whom he consummates the marriage; it becomes permissible for them not to observe HHijab in front of him. ” (End quote)\nRights and Duties of a Stepdaughter and Her Stepfather\nWith regard to the rights and duties of a stepdaughter and her mother’s husband towards one another, they may be summed up as upholding ties, respecting one another , and treating one another kindly. All Muslims are enjoined to treat their fellow Muslims with kindness, so how about those who become Mahrams due to ties through marriage. Undoubtedly they have a greater right to kindness and care than Muslims in general.\nBut spending on maintenance, serving and obeying are not obligatory between them. The stepdaughter does not come under the same ruling as her mother in these matters in terms of it being obligatory according to Islamic teachings. If the husband spends on his stepdaughter out of kindness, and she responds by treating him well, taking care of his house and serving him, then that is good, because bringing people together and creating harmony between them is an aim that Islam seeks to achieve.\nThe husband should understand that kind treatment of his wife includes kind treatment of her daughter. And the daughter should understand that part of honouring her mother is honouring the mother’s husband and treating him kindly.\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: (25/365):\n“There is the hope for the one who takes care of women other than his daughters, such as his sisters, paternal aunts, maternal aunts, and others who are in need, treating them with kindness, and providing them with food, drink and clothing, will attain a reward like that mentioned by the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) with regard to the one who takes care of three daughters, for the\xa0 grace and mercy of Allah are immense.\xa0\nThe same applies to one who takes care of one or two daughters or others, and treats them kindly; there is the hope that he will attain a great reward, as is indicated by the general meaning of the verses and hadiths that speak of kindness towards the poor and needy, relatives and others.\xa0\nIf this is the virtue of showing kindness towards daughters, then showing kindness towards parents, or one of them, or grandfathers or grandmothers ,will bring an even greater reward, because of the great significance of parents’ rights, and the obligation to honour them and treat them kindly. It makes no difference whether the one who is showing kindness is a father or a mother or anyone else, because the reward is connected to the deed. And Allah is the source of strength.” (End quote)\nThe importance of upholding kinship ties in Islam\nThe Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas was asked (25/296): How should the social family ties be in the Muslim household?\nThey replied:\n“Allah has enjoined upholding that which will strengthen ties between family members. He enjoins upholding ties of kinship, and treating relatives kindly, as He, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And fear Allah, through whom you ask one another, and the wombs. Indeed Allah is ever, over you, an Observer} [An-Nisa’ 4:1]\n{Worship Allah and associate nothing with Him, and to parents do good, and to relatives…} [An-Nisa’ 4:36]\n{Say, Come, I will recite what your Lord has prohibited to you. [He commands] that you not associate anything with Him, and to parents, good treatment, and do not kill your children out of poverty; We will provide for you and them} [Al-An`am 6:151]\n{And your Lord has decreed that you not worship except Him, and to parents, good treatment.} [Al-Isra’ 17:23]\nAnd there are other similar verses in the Quran.\nIt is proven that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “No one who severs ties of kinship will enter Paradise.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim)\nAnd he said: “Whoever would like for his provision to be increased and his life to be extended, let him uphold ties of kinship.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi)\nAnd he said: “Allah has forbidden to you disobedience towards mothers and burying daughters alive…” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim)\nAnd there are many other hadiths which encourage upholding of ties of kinship , adhering to Islamic etiquette and noble characteristics , and maintaining kind treatment, all of which strengthen the bonds between families and family members, and bring all Muslims together. This is the right way, not drifting away from the path of Islam and ignoring Islamic etiquette and the call for good manners.

423101,"I invested some money with a trader in car parts. He lives in another country, and because it is difficult for him to keep accounts, we agreed on a way to conduct our business, which is as follows: he buys some items for me and for him from another country, then when my items are delivered to his store, he calls me on my cell and I sell my items to him with a certain margin of profit. What is the ruling on this transaction?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThere is nothing wrong with appointing someone to buy an item for you, then when the proxy buys it, you sell it to him for a profit. For the duration of the proxy period, the item is a trust that is kept with the proxy, and if it is damaged, he is not liable for it, unless he is the one who caused the damage or was negligent.\nSo if your proxy bought your item and brought it to his own city, it is permissible for you to sell it to him.\nBut [before you sell it to him] you must make sure that he did actually buy the item and that he received the item that still belongs to you, so that it will not be like a trick to get money from you and return it with something extra.\nThe basic principle is that the one who buys a thing should not sell it until he has taken possession of it. In this case, when the proxy receives the item it is like the one who appointed him receiving it. So what actually happens is that he appoints the proxy to buy and receive the item, then after that the transaction between them is done face-to-face or over the phone.\nIn the statements and advice of the Islamic Fiqh Council, statement no. 52 (3/6) it says:\nIf there is a deal between two parties at the same time, when they are far apart in distance – and this is applicable to transactions done over the phone and wireless communications – then the deal between them is to be regarded as being like a deal between two people that is done face-to-face.\nSecondly:\nThere is nothing wrong with two people buying an item together as partners, with one of them promising the other that he will sell him his share after taking possession of it. So once they buy the item, one of them will sell his share, based on the market price. This is what is called a reduced-number partnership, in which the following conditions are stipulated:\n1. It should not be stipulated that you will buy the item from the other partner.\n2. It should not be a binding promise.\n3. There should be no promise to buy the partner’s share on the basis of its value at the time of forming the partnership, because that is guaranteeing to buy the partner’s share. Rather the sale should be at the market price at the time of the transaction.\nIt says in a statement of the Islamic Fiqh Council: The reduced-number partnership is permissible if it follows the general rulings on partnerships and attention is paid to the following guidelines:\na.. There should be no promise from either party to buy the share of the other for the value of the share at the time of forming the partnership, because that is guaranteeing the share of the partner. Rather the price should be determined based on the market value on the day of the transaction, or as is agreed when the transaction is done. End quote.\nIt says in al-Ma‘ayir ash-Shar ‘iyyah (p. 206): It is essential that when forming the partnership, there should be no stipulated conditions of buying and selling. Rather the partner may make a promise to that effect that is separate from the partnership. Similarly, the buying and selling should be done in a transaction that is independent of the partnership deal, and it is not permissible for one of the transactions to be mentioned are stipulated in the other.

138009,"When we say “As-salamu `Alaykum wa rahmat-Allah” at the end of the prayer, to whom are we saying that? Are we saying it to the angels who are present on our right and on our left, or are we saying it to the people on our right and on our left?","['Praise be to Allah.Taslim is one of the pillars of prayer\nThe Taslim or Salam at the end of the prayer is one of its pillars or essential parts, and one cannot end or exit from the prayer without saying it.\xa0\nAbu Dawud (61) and At-Tirmidhi (3) narrated from `Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The key to prayer is purification, its start is the Takbir (saying Allahu Akbar) and its exit is the Taslim (saying the Salam).” (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sunan Abu Dawud)\xa0\nThis is the view of a number of scholars, including the Imams Malik, Ash-Shafi`i and Ahmad.\xa0\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Our view is that it is obligatory, one of the pillars (essential parts) of prayer without which it is not valid. This is the view of the majority of scholars among the Companions, Successors and those who came after them. (End quote from Al-Majmu`, 3/462)\xa0\nWhy do we say Salam at the end of prayer?\nWhen saying the Salam, the worshipper should intend to exit the prayer and say Salam upon the Imam and those to his right and his left, and to the recording angels.\xa0\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“When saying the Salam, the Imam should intend the first Salam as an exit from the prayer and a greeting to those who are on his right and upon the recording angels, and he should intend the second Salam as a greeting to those on his left and the recording angels. The one who is praying behind him should intend the first Salam as an exit from the prayer and as a greeting to the Imam, the recording angels and the worshippers in his vicinity, in his row and behind him and in front of him, and he should intend the second Salam as a greeting to the worshippers in his vicinity, and if the Imam is in front of him, he should intend his two Salams to be greetings to him too.\xa0\nThe one who is praying alone should intend his first Salam as an exit from the prayer and a greeting to the recording angels, and the second Salam as a greeting to the recording angels. The basic principle in his case is that which was narrated by Samurah ibn Jundub (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed us to send Salams upon ourselves and to greet one another with Salam…\xa0\nIf he intends to exit the prayer and does not intend anything else, that is permissible because saying Salam to those who are present is Sunnah.” (End quote from Al-Majmu`, 3/456)\nMuslim (431) narrated that Jabir ibn Samurah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: When we prayed with the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) we used to say, As-salamu `Alaykum wa rahmat-Allah, As-salamu `alaykum wa rahmat-Allah (Peace be upon you and the mercy of Allah), and he gestured with his hand to either side. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Why do you gesture with your hands as if they were the tails of restive horses? Rather it is sufficient for one of you to put his hand on his thigh then say Salams to his brothers to his right and left.”\xa0\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“The words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), “then say Salams to his brothers to his right and left” refer to his fellow worshippers who are present on his right on his left. (End quote)\xa0\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“He should intend when saying the Salam, to exit the prayer; if he also intends alongside that to respond to the two angels and to those who are behind him, if he is the Imam, or to the Imam and the other people with him, if he is a member of the congregation, there is nothing wrong with that. This was stated by Ahmad who said: He may say the Salam at the end of the prayer, intending thereby to respond to the Imam.” End quote from Al-Mughni, 1/326-327)\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“If it is asked: upon whom are Salams being sent?\xa0\nThe answer is that they said: If there is a group of others with him, then the Salam is upon them; if there is no group with him, then the Salam is upon the angels who are on his right and his left, so he says: As-salamu `alaykum wa rahmat-Allah. (End quote from Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti`, 3/208)\xa0\nTo sum up, when saying the Salam at the end of the prayer, the worshipper intends three things:\xa0\n\nTo exit the prayer\nTo send Salams upon the recording angels\nTo send Salams upon his fellow-worshippers.\n\nIf he is praying alone, then he intends when saying the Salam to exit the prayer and send Salams upon the recording angels.\xa0\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 105297 , 69819 , 125897 , and 138666 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/138009/why-do-we-say-salam-at-the-end-of-prayer
