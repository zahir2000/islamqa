273858,"A man did the Islamic marriage contract, without doing the official civil contract. Shortly after doing the marriage contract, some troubles occurred, so the man decided to divorce her for some reason. What are the Islamic rulings that result from this divorce? Please note that he did not specify the dowry, and they were alone together, but the marriage was not consummated (intercourse).","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIf the marriage contract was done by the woman’s guardian or his proxy, in the presence of two witnesses, then it is a valid marriage, regardless of whether it was officially documented or not. Specifying the dowry is not a condition of the marriage contract, so if he married her without mentioning or specifying the dowry, the marriage is valid and the woman is entitled to a dowry like that of her peers.\nIbn Qudamah said in al-Mughni (7/182): The marriage is valid without specifying the dowry, according to the view of most scholars. That is indicated by the words of Allah, may He be exalted (interpretation of the meaning):\n{There is no blame upon you if you divorce women you have not touched nor specified for them an obligation [i.e., the dowry] }\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:236].\nIt was narrated from Ibn Mas‘ud that he was asked about a man who married a woman, and did not specify a dowry for her or consummate the marriage with her before he died. He said: She is entitled to a dowry like that of her peers, no more and no less; she must observe ‘iddah; and she is entitled to inheritance. Ma‘qil ibn Sinaan al-Ashja‘i stood up and said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) issued a ruling concerning Barwa‘ bint Waashiq, one of our womenfolk, similar to the ruling that you have issued.\xa0 Narrated by Abu Dawud and at-Tirmidhi, who said: it is a sahih hasan hadith. End quote.\nSecondly:\nIf the woman was divorced before consummation of the marriage and before being alone with her, if he had specified a dowry for her, then she is entitled to half of it, and if he did not specify any dowry for her, she is entitled to compensation, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{There is no blame upon you if you divorce women you have not touched nor specified for them an obligation [i.e., the dowry]. But give them [a gift of] compensation - the wealthy according to his capability and the poor according to his capability - a provision according to what is acceptable, a duty upon the doers of good.\nAnd if you divorce them before you have touched them and you have already specified for them an obligation, then [give] half of what you specified - unless they forego the right or the one in whose hand is the marriage contract foregoes it. And to forego it is nearer to righteousness. And do not forget graciousness between you. Indeed Allah, of whatever you do, is Seeing}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:236, 237].\nThere is no stipulated amount for this compensation according to Islamic teachings; rather it depends on how well off or otherwise the man is. If they agree on a certain amount, then the purpose has been served. If they disagree, then it is the judge who should determine the amount.\nShaykh Muhammad al-Amin ash-Shinqiti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIn fact, there is no amount for that compensation that is stipulated according to Islamic law, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning) {the wealthy according to his capability and the poor according to his capability} [al-Baqarah 2:236].\nSo if they agree on a certain amount, the matter is clear. If they differ, then the judge should work out what is most appropriate, and he should determine the amount in the light of the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning) {the wealthy according to his capability …} [al-Baqarah 2:236]. This is what appears to be the case.\nThe apparent meaning of the words {[a gift of] compensation} [al-Baqarah 2:236] and {And for divorced women is a provision} [al-Baqarah 2:241] indicates that it is obligatory to give this compensation or provision in general terms. This is in contrast to the view of Malik and those who agreed with him; he said that it is not obligatory to give this compensation or provision at all.""(Adwa’ al-Bayan\xa0 1/192).\nThirdly:\nIf the divorce takes place before consummation of the marriage, but when the couple have been completely alone together in such a way that it was possible to consummate the marriage with her, then the majority of Hanafi and Maliki scholars – and ash-Shafa‘i in his old view – and the Hanbalis are of the view that she must observe ‘iddah, then she is entitled to the dowry in full.\nThis was narrated from a number of the senior Sahabah, such as ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab, ‘Ali, Zayd ibn Thabit, Mu‘adh ibn Jabal and ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with them).\n‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) consulted a number of the Companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and none of them differed concerning the fact that the dowry is obligatory in that case.\nThere are conditions attached to this being alone together, which have been explained previously in the answer to question no. 268304 . One of these conditions is that she should have been willing and that she would not have prevented him from having intercourse if he had wanted to.\nIf this being alone together did indeed occur, then this woman must be given a dowry like that of her peers, in full. If it did not occur, then she is not entitled to anything except compensation.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/273858/he-divorced-her-before-consummating-the-marriage-and-after-being-alone-with-her-and-he-did-not-specify-any-dowry-for-her
130071,"Is it permissible to use contraceptives because of my low income, which does not cover our needs and living costs, in addition to the fact that I am in poor health and suffer from exhaustion and fatigue? Please note that I am afraid that that will be compounded if we have many children.","['Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to use contraceptives for fear of low income, because Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, is the Provider. This is akin to the actions of the people of Jahiliyyah who killed their children for fear of poverty. Rather you should think positively of Allah and put your trust in Him, may He be glorified and exalted.\nAllah is the Provider, the Almighty, may He be glorified and exalted, and it is He, may He be glorified and exalted, Who says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{There is no creature that lives on the earth but its sustenance is guaranteed by Allah}\xa0[Hud 11:6].\nSo what is required is for both husband and wife to think positively of Allah and not use contraceptives.\nBut if the contraceptive is used for a different reason, such as if the mother is sick or if there is\xa0 the risk of harm to her health or her uterus, or there is fear of harm to both of them; or because they already have a lot of children, and without contraception there will be one pregnancy after another, without a break, so she wants to use contraception for a short period, such as a year or two, so that it will not be too difficult to raise the children and so that she will not become unable to do that – then there is nothing wrong with that, as it is in the best interests of the children, and it is not due to thinking negatively of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. The same applies if having another pregnancy could harm her and she is unable to cope. But if the matter has to do with provision (rizq), then the Provider is Allah; regardless of whether you are sick or healthy, it is Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, Who provides for you and in His hand is the control of all things. So you must think positively of Allah and put your trust in Allah, for Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, is the Provider, Lord of Might, the Powerful.

337891,Is it permissible to fast when one has Covid-19?,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThere is nothing special about Covid-19 with regard to fasting, and there is no specific reason connected to Covid-19 that has anything to do with the ruling on fasting or not.\nRather the one who has Covid-19 is like any other sick person, meaning that if it is clearly too difficult for him to fast, then it is permissible for him not to fast, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{So whoever among you is ill or on a journey [during them] - then an equal number of days [are to be made up]}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:184].\nIbn Hazm (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The scholars are unanimously agreed that if sickness weakens a person and makes him unable to fast, then he may break the fast.""(Maratib al-Ijma‘, p. 40).\nSecondly:\nThere are several scenarios for one who is sick:\n1.\xa0If his sickness is mild, meaning that it will not harm him and it does not make it difficult to fast, such as a mild cold or mild headache, then in this case he must fast according to the majority of scholars, and it is haram for him not to fast.\n2.\xa0If his sickness makes it too difficult for him to fast, but it will not harm him, then in this case it is permissible for him not to fast, according to scholarly consensus, as noted above.\n3.\xa0If there is the fear that he may die of this sickness, then it is obligatory for him not to fast, according to the majority of scholars.\n4.\xa0If his sickness will harm him, meaning that fasting will exacerbate his sickness or delay his recovery, then there is a difference of scholarly opinion: is it permissible or obligatory for him to break the fast? The correct view is that it is obligatory.\nSome of the jurists restrict the obligation to break the fast to cases where severe harm will occur.\nIbn Nujaym said in al-Bahr ar-Ra’iq (2/303): The one who fears that his sickness will be exacerbated may break the fast, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{So whoever among you is ill or on a journey [during them] - then an equal number of days [are to be made up]}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:184].\nSo it is permissible for anyone who is sick to break the fast.\nBut the reason why breaking the fast is permitted in the case of sickness is only for the purpose of warding off harm, and what is meant by harm is exacerbation of the sickness, or delay in recovery, or damage caused to some limb or faculty.\nAscertaining that [what will happen if one fasts] may be based on the sick person’s own ijtihad, and his conclusion is not to be based on mere speculation; rather it is based on what is most likely to happen, which in turn is based on some symptoms of his sickness or his experience, or if a Muslim doctor who does not appear to be of bad character tells him that. And it was said that being certain that the doctor who tells him that is of good character is stipulated [in order to accept his advice] …\nThe sick person has the choice between fasting and not fasting, but not fasting is a concession, whereas fasting is a sign of religious commitment, so it is preferable. But if the sick person fears that he may die, then breaking the fast becomes obligatory. This is what it says in al-Bada’i‘. End quote.\n‘Ulaysh said in Minah al-Jalil (2/150): And it is permissible to break the fast because of sickness when the sick person fears, or he is certain or thinks it most likely, based on his own experience, or if he is told by a physician of good character that the sickness will be exacerbated by fasting, or recovery will be delayed, or the sick person will suffer hardship and fatigue as a result of fasting, or even if the sickness will not be exacerbated and recovery will not be delayed [but the individual finds it too difficult to fast].\nBut if the individual fears that he will become sick as a result of fasting, it is not permissible for him to break the fast. This is the correct view, because perhaps that will not happen to him at all.\nAnd it was said that it is permissible.\nIt is obligatory to break the fast, whether the individual is sick or healthy, if he fears, or he is certain or thinks it most likely that he may die or suffer severe harm that will lead to losing a faculty such as his vision, if he fasts, because preserving life and faculties is obligatory. End quote.\nIt says in Mughni al-Muhtaj (2/169): It is permissible for the sick person not to fast, with the intention of availing himself of the concession, according to the religious texts and scholarly consensus, if that will lead to severe harm and the harm is of the type that makes tayammum permissible. This is what is mentioned in ash-Sharhayn wa’r-Rawdah. As for what the author said – that the sick person for whom fasting is too difficult or he will be greatly harmed by it – this means that either of the two is sufficient [to allow him not to fast]. That, as al-Isnawi said, is the correct view. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{and do not throw [yourselves] with your [own] hands into destruction}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:195].\n… And he must break the fast if he fears death, as was stated by al-Ghazali and others, and was affirmed by al-Adhra‘i. End quote.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Kafi (1/434): The sick person may break his fast, but he must make it up, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{So whoever among you is ill or on a journey [during them] - then an equal number of days [are to be made up]}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:184].\nWhat makes it permissible not to fast is the fear that fasting may exacerbate his sickness or delay recovery.\nAs for that which is not affected by fasting, such as toothache or a pain in the finger, and the like, that does not make it permissible to break the fast, because no harm will result from fasting. If someone starts the day fasting then falls sick during the day, he may break the fast, because harm is already there. End quote.\nThe correct view is that if fasting will cause him harm, then he must break the fast.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is permissible for a sick person [to break the fast] if fasting will harm him. So if a person is sick and could be harmed by fasting, then breaking the fast is prescribed in his case. This is according to what the author (may Allah have mercy on him) said.\nIf he does not break the fast, then he is turning away from the concession granted by Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, and turning away from the concession granted by Allah is wrong. What the individual should do is accept the concession granted by Allah.\nThe correct view is that if fasting will harm him, then fasting becomes haram and breaking the fast becomes obligatory, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{ And do not kill yourselves}\xa0[an-Nisa’ 4:29].\nThis prohibition includes fasting, if it could lead to death, or if it could lead to harm.\nThe evidence that it includes that which could lead to harm is the hadith of ‘Amr ibn al-‘As (may Allah be pleased with him): when he led his companions in prayer whilst in a state of janabah, but he was afraid of the cold, so he did tayammum. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to him: “Did you lead your companions in prayer when you were junub?” He said: O Messenger of Allah, I remembered the words of Allah, may He be exalted: (interpretation of the meaning): {And do not kill yourselves} [an-Nisa’ 4:29], and I was afraid of the cold. And the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) approved of what he had done.\nIn the case of one who is sick, there may be different scenarios:\n1.\xa0He will not be affected by fasting, as in the case of a mild cold, or a mild headache, or a toothache, and the like. In this case it is not permissible for him to break the fast, even though some of the scholars said that that is permissible for him, because of the general meaning of the verse {and whoever is ill…} [al-Baqarah 2:185]. But we said: This ruling is based on the reason for it, so when breaking the fast is kinder to him, in that case we say that he may break the fast. But if fasting will not affect him, it is not permissible for him to break the fast and it is obligatory for him to fast.\n2.\xa0If it is very difficult for him to fast, but it will not harm him, then in this case it is disliked (makruh) for him to fast and it is prescribed for him to break the fast.\n3.\xa0If it is too difficult for him to fast and doing so will harm him, as in the case of a man who has kidney disease or diabetes and the like, then in this case it is haram for him to fast.\nBut if he does fast in this case, is his fast valid?\nAbu Muhammad ibn Hazm (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is not valid for him to fast, because Allah, may He be exalted, ruled that one who is sick may fast on other days. So if he fasts when he is sick, he is like one who is able to fast, but fasted in Sha‘ban instead of Ramadan, so his fast is not valid and he must make it up.\nThis view of Abu Muhammad is based on the famous principal that whatever is forbidden in and of itself, if it happens it is not valid. So if we say that it is haram, then according to the juristic principle, if he fasts it is not valid, because he observed a fast that was prohibited, like fasting on the days of at-tashriq and on the days of the two Eids; it is not permissible and it is not valid.\nThus to those sick people who decide that it is better to fast when fasting is difficult for them and may harm them, but they insist on fasting, we say that they did wrong when they did not accept the kindness of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, and they did not accept His concession, and they harmed themselves. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And do not kill yourselves}\xa0[an-Nisa’ 4:29].\nEnd quote from ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘ (6/340).\nAnd he (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If someone were to ask: how do we determine whether fasting will cause harm and to what degree?\nWe say: harm is determined by how a person feels, and it may be known if a doctor tells him. As for his feelings, that means that he feels himself that fasting will harm him, cause more pain or delay recovery, and the like.\nAs for being told by a doctor, that means that a knowledgeable and trustworthy doctor tells him that it will harm him. If an ordinary person who is not a doctor tells him that, however, he should not take his word for it, and if someone who is not a knowledgeable doctor – rather he is someone who is involved in the medical field – tells him that, he should not take his word for it either. And if an untrustworthy doctor told him that, he should not take his word for it.\nIs it stipulated that the doctor should be a Muslim in order to be trustworthy, because non-Muslims are not to be trusted?\nThere are two scholarly views concerning that. The correct view is that it is not stipulated, and that if we trust what he says, we may follow his advice not to fast, because that is his profession, and a non-Muslim may be sincere to his profession and keen to uphold his reputation as a doctor, so that he only says what he believes to be true. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) trusted a disbeliever in the most risky situation, which was when he migrated from Makkah to Madinah. He hired a polytheist man from the tribe of Banu’d-Dayyal who was called ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Urayqit, as his guide during the journey. This was a very risky matter, because Quraysh were searching for the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and were offering a reward of one hundred she-camels to the one who brought news of him. But the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) trusted him, which indicates that if we trust a polytheist, then we may accept his word.""(Ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘\xa0 6/328).\nConclusion:\nThe one who has Covid-19 is sick, like any other sick person. If fasting will harm him by exacerbating his sickness or delaying recovery, according to the testimony of a trustworthy doctor, or because he feels that himself, then he must break the fast.\nIf fasting will not harm him, but it will cause him considerable hardship, then it is permissible for him to break the fast.\nBut breaking the fast has nothing to do with protecting oneself against sickness. There is no proof of that at all, and no one who has knowledge of medicine or is qualified to speak about such matters said that. So you should beware of the rumours that some people are spreading which have no scientific basis.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/337891/is-it-obligatory-to-fast-ramadan-for-one-who-has-covid-19
