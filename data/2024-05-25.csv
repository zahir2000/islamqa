487558,"In Many Hadiths it is mentionned that whoever makes wudu in he’s house and then go to the masjid, he will have for each steps 1 good deed written,1 sin erased,and he will be raised in degree in jannah is this reward only for those who make wudu from their home or for example if someone makes wudu from he’s work,or from the toilet of a supermarket, or in the street he find a water point and makes he’s wudu there and go the the mosque will he get the reward too or to attain it a person have to go he’s home and perform ablution and then to the mosque to attain it?","['Praise be to Allah.Al-Bukhari (477) and Muslim (649) narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “A man’s prayer in congregation is twenty-five times better than his prayer in his house or his marketplace. That is because if one of you does wudu and does it well, then comes to the mosque, with no other motive or purpose than to pray, then he does not take any step but Allah will raise him one degree in status thereby, and will erase one sin from him thereby, until he enters the mosque. When he enters the mosque, he is in a state of prayer so long as the prayer is what is keeping him there, and the angels send blessings on him so long as he remains in the place where he prayed, saying, ‘O Allah, forgive him; O Allah, have mercy on him,’ so long as he does not break his wudu.”\nThis hadith is general in meaning, and includes doing wudu in one’s house or elsewhere.\nBased on that, if he does wudu in the place where he is, whether it is his house or the marketplace or the workplace, wherever he is, then he goes out from that place for no purpose except to pray, then he will attain the reward mentioned in this hadith.\nWith regard to the report narrated by Muslim (666) from Abu Hurayrah, who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever purifies himself in his house then walks to one of the houses of Allah in order to offer one of the obligatory prayers enjoined by Allah, for every two steps he takes, one will erase a sin and the other will raise him one degree in status”,\nthis report specifically refers to when he purifies himself at home. It is mentioned in this way because – and Allah knows best – this is what is mostly the case. Rather what is meant is that he does wudu in the place where he is, and for that reason there is a differentiation in virtue between his praying in the mosque and his praying at home or in the marketplace. The last two are both surpassed by prayer offered in congregation.\nAs-Suyuti said in al-Tawshih Sharh al-Jami‘ as-Sahih (2/680): “In his house or in his marketplace” refers to praying on his ow, which is what is mostly the case. This was stated by Ibn Daqiq al-‘Eid. End quote.\nAl-Minnawi said in at-Taysir (2/97): The house and the marketplace are singled out for mention to alert people to the fact that the multiplication of the reward will not apply in places other than the mosque. End quote.\nAs-Sindi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his commentary on the hadith, “Whoever does wudu in his house, then comes to Masjid Quba’ and offers a prayer there, he will have a reward like that of ‘umrah”:\nThis specific mention [of Masjid Quba’] is not the reason for attaining this reward; rather he mentioned it in order to highlight the fact that going to the mosque is only for the one whose house is close to it, so that he can purify himself at home and pray in the mosque with that purification, such as the people of Madinah and the people of Quba’, because they do not need to prepare themselves to travel. Preparing oneself to travel is not permissible except for the purpose of visiting the three mosques, and it is as if this is the reason why that specific matter was not mentioned in the previous hadith.""(Hashiyat as-Sindi ‘ala Sunan Ibn Majah\xa0 1/431).\nThat reward is dependent on all these conditions being met, namely that the person purifies himself in his house or the place where he is, then he walks to a mosque where prayer is offered in congregation, and he does not set out from the place where he is for any purpose except the prayer.\nIbn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) said: In al-Musnad and Sahih Ibn Hibban, it is narrated from ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever goes to the mosque to pray in congregation, for every two steps he takes, one will erase a bad deed and the other will earn him a good deed, on the way there and on the way back.”\nThis general statement is subject to two restrictions as mentioned in the hadith of Abu Salih from Abu Hurayrah, which was narrated by al-Bukhari, and was mentioned above and will be mentioned below:\n1. That he should come out of his house in a state of purity, having purified himself well and thoroughly.\n2. That he should only be going out for the purpose of praying in the mosque. If he goes out to do an errand, and the mosque is on his way, so he enters the mosque and prays, but he did not go out for that purpose, then he will not attain this particular reward.\nThe same applies if he goes out of his house without having purified himself, he will attain a different reward. However, this particular reward – which is being raised in status and having bad deeds erased – will be not be attained in this case.""(Fath al-Bari\xa0 6/32).\nConclusion:\nThis reward is restricted to one who purifies himself in his house or in the place where he is, then goes out for no purpose except to pray. The one who goes out without having purified himself, or goes out from the place where he is without having prayer as his primary aim is not one of those who will attain this particular reward.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/487558/the-reward-of-one-who-does-wudu-in-his-house-then-goes-to-the-mosque-will-this-reward-also-be-attained-by-one-who-does-wudu-in-his-workplace-or-in-the-marketplace
136695,I want to pray after the Sunnah of Fajr and before the Iqamah for the prayer. I want to pray whatever Allah wills I should pray until the Iqamah for the prayer is given. What is the ruling on that?,"['Praise be to Allah.The scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) differed concerning voluntary prayers after dawn has broken and before the Fajr prayer. The Hanbali view is that it is not allowed, except for the Sunnah prayer of Fajr only.\xa0\nIt says in Daqa’iq Uli An-Nuha, 1/272: “There are five times when prayer is not allowed , one of which is from the break of dawn until sunrise.”\nWhat is meant is that once dawn has broken, one should offer the two Rak`ahs of Fajr , then refrain from praying, because of the report narrated by Abu Dawud (1278) from Yasar, the freed slave of Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: Ibn `Umar saw me when I was praying after the break of dawn, and he said: O Yasar, the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came out to us when we were offering this prayer and said: “Let those of you who are present convey it to those of you who are absent: do not pray anything after dawn except two Rak`ahs.”\xa0\nThe Hadith was classed as authentic by Al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) in Sahih Abu Dawud.\xa0\nIn their view, this is based on the fact that the prohibition has to do with the time – which is the break of dawn, not with the act of prayer. There is another report from Ahmad, which is also the view of the Shafi`is, that the prohibition has to do with the act of prayer; hence, once one has prayed Fajr, one should refrain from praying, because of the report narrated by Abu Sa`id (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no prayer after `Asr prayer until the sun sets, and there is no prayer after Fajr prayer until the sun rises.” (Narrated by Muslim, 827)\nAccording to the Hadith of `Amr ibn `Abasah (may Allah be pleased with him) the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Pray Fajr, then refrain from praying until the sun rises.” (Narrated by Muslim, 823) What this means is that the time when prayer is not allowed begins when one has prayed Fajr, not when dawn breaks.\xa0(See: Al-Majmu`, 4/76; Al-Mughni, 1/428; Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah, 7/183)\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) thought that this opinion was more likely to be correct, so from after Fajr prayer until sunrise is the time when prayer is not allowed. But before Fajr prayer there is no time when prayer is not allowed, but it is not prescribed to do anything at that time except offer the two (Sunnah) Rak`ahs of Fajr, because this is what was narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and there is no report to suggest that he offered any voluntary prayer other than that.\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “But the correct view is that the prohibition has to do with Fajr prayer itself. As for the time between the adhan and iqamah, it is not included in the prohibition, however it is not prescribed to offer anything in that time apart from the two (Sunnah) Rak`ahs of Fajr. If this is the correct view, then what is the response concerning the Hadith that is quoted as evidence by the author?\xa0\nThe response to that notes two things:\xa0\n\nThat the Hadith is inauthentic\nEven if we assume that the Hadith is authentic, the words “There is no prayer after the break of dawn” may be understood as meaning that it is not prescribed for a person to offer any voluntary prayer other than the two (Sunnah) Rak`ahs of Fajr after the break of dawn, and that is true, because it is not appropriate for\xa0 a person, after the break of dawn, to offer any voluntary prayer except the two Sunnah Rak`ahs of Fajr. So if you enter the mosque and pray the two (Sunnah) Rak`ahs of Fajr , and the time for the (fard) prayer has not yet come, and you say, I shall offer a voluntary prayer, we would say to you: Do not do that, because this is not prescribed; but if you were to do it, you would not be sinning. Rather we say that it is not prescribed, because the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) only prayed two brief Rak`ahs after the break of dawn, and that is the Sunnah of Fajr prayer only. Moreover, even making the two Rak`ahs lengthy is not prescribed.” (Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti`, 4/51)\xa0\n\nShaykh Al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Note: Al-Bayhaqi narrated with an authentic chain of narrators from Sa`id ibn Al-Musayyab that he saw a man praying more than two Rak`ahs after dawn broke, bowing and prostrating a great deal, and he told him not to do that. The man said: O Abu Muhammad, will Allah punish me for praying? He said: No, but He will punish you for going against the Sunnah. This is an example of the brilliant answers of Sa`id ibn Al-Musayyab (may Allah have mercy on him), and it is a powerful weapon against the innovators who think many innovations are good on the grounds that they are dhikr (remembrance of Allah) and prayer, then they criticise Ahl as-Sunnah for criticising their actions and accuse them of forbidding dhikr and prayer!, When in fact they are only criticising their going against the Sunnah with regard to dhikr and prayer and so on.” (Irwa’ Al-Ghalil, 2/236)\n\xa0And Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/136695/can-we-pray-voluntary-prayers-after-the-sunnah-of-fajr
276445,Is there a difference between a nabi (prophet) and a rasul (messenger)?,"['Praise be to Allah.The scholars differed regarding that. Some of them said that there is no difference between a nabi and a rasul, and others said that there is a difference between a nabi and a rasul.\nThe latter is the correct view, because the basic principle in speech is to establish ideas, not to repeat ideas for the purpose of emphasis.\nAbu’l-Baqa’ al-Kafawi said in al-Kulliyyat (p.1065): Establishing ideas is more important than repeating ideas for the purpose of emphasis, because establishing new ideas is better than mere repetation. End quote.\nThen the scholars differed with regard to how these differences are to be defined and explained.\nThe most well-known view is that a nabi and a rasul both receive revelation, but the rasul is commanded by Allah to convey it, whereas the nabi is not commanded to convey it.\nAl-Khattabi said in A‘lam al-Hadith (1/298): The difference between the nabi and the rasul is that the nabi is the one who is told or informed about things, whereas the rasul is the one who is enjoined to convey what he is told and informed about. Hence every rasul is a nabi but not every nabi is a rasul. End quote.\nIbn Hajar said in Fath al-Bari (11/112): al-Qurtubi said, following the view of others: This is proof for those who do not allow the transmission of hadiths on the basis of meaning, and it is the correct view among the Malikis, because the words nabi and rasul come from different roots.\nThe word nabi comes from the root naba’, which refers to news. Thus the nabi is the one who is told by Allah a command that becomes like an obligation. If he is commanded to convey [what he is told] to others, then he is a rasul, otherwise he is a nabi and not a rasul. Based on that, every rasul is a nabi, but the opposite is not the case. Thus the nabi and the rasul have something in common, which is receiving news, but they differ with regard to conveying the message. So if you say that So and so is a rasul, this implies that he is a nabi and rasul; but if you say that So and so is a nabi, this does not imply that he is a rasul. End quote.\nIbn al-Mulaqqin said in al-Mu‘in ‘ala Tafahhum al-Arba‘in (p. 39): Rusul is the plural of rasul, which refers to the one who is commanded to convey the revelation to people; this is more specific than the word nabi. Thus he [the rasul] is the one who receives revelation to act upon and convey, in contrast to the nabi, who receives revelation to act upon it only. End quote.\nSome of the scholars say that both receive revelation and both are commanded to convey it, but the rasul has a book from Allah. Other scholars say that the rasul is the one to whom a book comes down, or to whom an angel comes, whereas the nabi is the one who receives revelation, or follows another rasul.\nAl-‘Ayni said in al-Binayah Sharh al-Hidayah (1/116): The difference between the rasul and the nabi is that the rasul is the one who is sent to convey the revelation and has a book, whereas the nabi is the one who is sent to convey revelation in general terms, either with or without a book. This was stated by Shaykh Qawwam ad-Din al-Atrazi in his Sharh…\nThen he said: The correct view in this case is that the rasul is the one to whom a book comes down, or an angel comes to him, whereas the nabi is the one whom Allah, may He be exalted, informs of the rulings, or he follows another rasul. End quote.\nPerhaps the best that may be said concerning this matter is:\nThe nabi and rasul have in common the fact that they both receive revelation. This is indicated by the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Indeed, We have revealed to you, [O Muhammad], as We revealed to Noah and the prophets after him. And we revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, the Descendants, Jesus, Job, Jonah, Aaron, and Solomon, and to David We gave the book [of Psalms]}\xa0[an-Nisa’ 4:163].\nThey also have in common the fact that they are both commanded to convey the message, as mentioned in the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And We did not send before you any messenger or prophet except that when he spoke [or recited], Satan threw into it [some misunderstanding]. But Allah abolishes that which Satan throws in; then Allah makes precise His verses. And Allah is Knowing and Wise}\xa0[Al-Hajj 22:52].\nShaykh ash-Shinqiti said in Adwa’ al-Bayan (5/290): This verse of Soorat al-Hajj indicates that what is commonly known among the people of knowledge, that the nabi is the one who receives revelation and is not enjoined to convey it, whereas the rasul is the nabi who receives revelation and is commanded to convey what is revealed to him, is not correct, because the words {And We did not send before you any messenger or prophet …} indicate that both are sent, but there is some difference between them.\nSome of the scholars suggested that the nabi who is also a rasul is the one to whom a book and an independent system of law are sent down, in addition to miracles which prove that he is a true prophet, whereas the nabi who is sent, who is different from a rasul, is the one to whom no book is sent down; rather he receives revelation telling him to call people to the system of law of the rasul who came before him. An example of that is the Israelite prophets who were sent and instructed to act in accordance with the Torah, as Allah, may He be exalted, states in the verse (interpretation of the meaning): {The prophets who submitted [to Allah ] judged by it\xa0…} [al-Ma’idah 5:44]. End quote.\nThe rasul and nabi differ in that the rasul is enjoined to convey the message to one of the disbelieving nations. As for the nabi, he is enjoined to convey the message and call people, without having a separate message for a new nation among those who reject the truth.\nShaykh al-Islam said in an-Nubuwwat (2/714): The nabi is the one to whom Allah sends revelation, which carries a message from Allah. If, in addition to that, he is sent to those who go against the command of Allah, to convey a message from Allah to them, then he is a rasul.\nBut if he is sent to implement the system of law that came before him, and he is not sent to anyone to convey a message from Allah to him, then he is a nabi, and not a rasul. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {And We did not send before you any messenger or prophet except that when he spoke [or recited], Satan threw into it [some misunderstanding]} [Al-Hajj 22:52].\nThe words {any messenger or prophet} mention the idea of sending in general terms, which includes both types. One of them is called a rasul, which refers to a messenger in a general sense whom Allah instructs to convey His message to those who opposed Him, such as Nuh. It is affirmed in the sahih hadiths that he was the first messenger (rasul) sent to the people of Earth, and that before him there were prophets (anbiya’), such as Shith and Idris (peace be upon them), and before them there was Adam, to whom Allah spoke directly. Ibn ‘Abbas said: Between Adam and Nuh there were ten generations, each of whom followed Islam.\nThose prophets (anbiya’) received revelation from Allah telling them what they should do, and they instructed the believers who followed them to do the same, because they believed in them, just as the followers of a system of law accept what the scholars convey from the rasul.\nAnother example of that is the Israelite prophets, who enjoined the system of law of the Torah, one of whom might receive revelation specifically for him to keep to himself and not convey, regarding a specific incident. But with regard to the Torah system of law, they were like scholars whom Allah enabled to work out an issue in the light of the Torah, just as Allah enables Muslim scholars to understand some matter in accordance with the Quran, and Allah enabled Sulayman to work out a ruling on the matter that he judged along with Dawud.\nThus Allah informed the prophets (anbiya’) of His commands and prohibitions, and other matters, and they told those who believed in them what Allah told them of news, commands and prohibitions.\nBut if they were sent to the disbelievers to call them to affirm Allah’s oneness and worship Him alone, with no partner or associate, there would inevitably be some people who would reject and deny the messengers (rusul). Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Similarly, there came not to those before them any messenger except that they said, “A magician or a madman”}[adh-Dhariyat 51:52]\n{Nothing is said to you, [O Muhammad], except what was already said to the messengers before you}[Fussilat 41:43].\nThe messengers (rusul) were sent to people who opposed the divine message, and some of them rejected that message. Allah says:\n{And We sent not before you [as messengers] except men to whom We revealed from among the people of cities. So have they not traveled through the earth and observed how was the end of those before them? And the home of the Hereafter is best for those who fear Allah; then will you not reason?\n\xa0[They continued] until, when the messengers despaired and were certain that they had been denied, there came to them Our victory, and whoever We willed was saved. And Our punishment cannot be repelled from the people who are criminals}[Yusuf 12:109-110]\n{Indeed, We will support Our messengers and those who believe during the life of this world and on the Day when the witnesses will stand}\xa0[Ghafir 40:51].\nThe verse {And We did not send before you any messenger or prophet …} [al-Hajj 22:52] indicates that the nabi is sent, but is not usually called a rasul, because he was not sent to people with something that they did not know. Rather he would enjoin the believers to adhere to what they knew to be true, as a scholar does.\nHence the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The scholars are the heirs of the prophets.” It is not stipulated that a rasul should bring a new system of law; Yusuf followed the path of Ibrahim, and Dawud and Sulayman were messengers (rasul), although they followed the system of law of the Torah. And Allah, may He be exalted, tells us that the believer of the household of Pharaoh said (interpretation of the meaning):\n{“And Joseph had already come to you before with clear proofs, but you remained in doubt of that which he brought to you, until when he died, you said, ‘Never will Allah send a messenger after him.’}\xa0[Ghafir 40:34].\nEnd quote.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/276445/the-difference-between-a-nabi-prophet-and-a-rasul-messenger
323358,"If you cannot weep during prayer, should you make yourself weep?","['Praise be to Allah.Weeping during prayer is one of the outcomes of humble submission (khushu‘) in prayer, and Allah, may He be exalted, praises those who are humbly submissive in their prayer, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Certainly will the believers have succeeded,\nThey who are during their prayer humbly submissive}\xa0[Al-Mu’minun 23:1-2].\nIbn Juzayy (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Humble submission (khushu‘) is a state of heart, which results from fear of Allah, awareness that Allah is watching and humility before the greatness of the Lord, may He be glorified and exalted. The impact of that is seen in the limbs, which become still, and also includes focusing on the prayer, not looking around, weeping, and beseeching.""(Tafsir ibn Juzayy\xa0 2/48).\nHence weeping during prayer stems from fear of Allah, which is something prescribed and required. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And they fall upon their faces weeping, and the Qur’an increases them in humble submission}\xa0[Al-Isra’ 17:109].\nAl-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The word {weeping} indicates that it is permissible to weep during prayer out of fear of Allah, may He be exalted, or because of having disobeyed Allah, and that does not interrupt the prayer or detract from it.""(Tafsir al-Qurtubi\xa0 10/342).\nIt is soundly narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his companions that they used to weep during prayer out of fear of Allah.\nIt was narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn ash-Shikhkhir (m ay Allah be pleased with him) said: I came to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) when he was praying and his sobbing sounded like water boiling in a pot – meaning that he was weeping. Narrated by an-Nasa’i (1214); classed as sahih by al-Albani.\nIt was narrated from ‘A’ishah, the Mother of the Believers, that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said during his final sickness: “Tell Abu Bakr to lead the people in prayer.” ‘A’ishah said: If Abu Bakr stands in your place, he will not be able to make the people hear him because of his weeping, so tell ‘Umar to lead the people in prayer… Narrated by al-Bukhari (716).\nThis weeping is one of the outcomes of humble submission (khushu‘), but not weeping does not mean that one has not attained humble submission. Many of the Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) described the Prophet’s prayer without mentioning that he wept during it, and he is the foremost of those who fear Allah and submit humbly to Him.\nAt-Tabari narrated that Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said regarding the verse {They who are during their prayer humbly submissive} [al-Mu’minun 23:2]: They are filled with fear of Allah and are calm. Tafsir at-Tabari (17/10).\nShaykh al-Amin ash-Shinqiti (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The root meaning of the word khushu‘ (translated here as humble submission) is stillness and calmness, and a physical posture that is indicative of humility.\nIn Islamic terminology, it refers to fear of Allah in the heart, the impact of which is seen in the limbs and physical posture.""(Adwa’ al-Bayan\xa0 5/825).\nSecondly:\nThe type of weeping that is praiseworthy is that which overcomes a person because of his softheartedness and his humble submission in his prayer, and when he hears the verses of Allah being recited to him.\nThe one who is not able to weep should not miss out on reflecting [on the meaning of the verses recited] or on humble submission in his heart resulting in stillness of his limbs, because there is no connection between the two. The heart may be humbly submissive, without there being tears in the eyes, or there may be tears in the eyes, but no humble submission in the heart, which is the worst of states, Allah forbid.\nRegarding the hadith, “This Qur’an was sent down with sorrow, so when you read it, then weep, and if you do not weep, make yourself weep” (narrated by Ibn Majah, 1337), it is a da‘if (weak) hadith and is not sahih (sound). Al-Busayri said: This isnad includes Abu Rafi‘, whose name is Isma‘il ibn Rafi‘; he is da‘if (weak) and matruk (his hadith is to be rejected). Misbah az-Zujajah fi Zawa’id Ibn Majah (1/157). It was also classed as da‘if by al-Albani.\nIf we assume that the hadith is sahih, what is meant by making oneself weep is having focus in the heart and making oneself feel sorrow; it does not mean making artificial sounds to resemble weeping. That is a kind of effort that is not allowed; rather some of the scholars have stated that deliberately making sounds that resemble weeping invalidates the prayer.\nAl-Fayyumi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Ibn ‘Abbas said: If a person recites the verse in al-Isra’ in which there is a sajdah (v. 109), do not hasten to prostrate unless you are weeping, and if the eyes of one of you are not weeping, then let him make his heart weep. The way to make oneself weep is to bring sorrow into one’s heart.""(Fath al-Qarib al-Mujib ‘ala at-Targhib wa’t-Tarhib\xa07/121).\nShaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: What is the ruling on making oneself weep? And how sound are the reports that were narrated concerning that?\nHe replied: In some hadiths it says that if you do not weep, then make yourself weep, but I do not know how sound that is… What appears to be the case is that one should not put effort into making oneself weep; rather if a person finds himself weeping, he should try hard not to disturb others, and his weeping should be quiet; he should avoid disturbing others as much as possible.""(Majmu‘ Fatawa wa Maqalat\xa0 11/347).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\xa0 What is the ruling on making oneself weep loudly during congregational prayers in the mosque in order to create an atmosphere of humble submission (khushu‘)?\nHe replied: Making oneself cry artificially – as some people do – is not prescribed in Islamic teachings.\nAs for that weeping which stems from humble submission in the heart, bringing to mind the greatness of the Lord and fearing Him, this is something that is prescribed, and if a person makes a sound involuntarily, without making himself do that, there is nothing wrong with that.\nBut pretending to weep is something that is not prescribed and is not appropriate; rather what is required is to reflect on the words of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, with sincerity and understanding the meaning. Then if a person’s heart softens as a result of that and becomes humbly submissive, and he weeps when punishment is mentioned out of fear of it, and when reward is mentioned out of hope for it, and when the Lord is mentioned out of reverence towards Him, and when the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his story are mentioned out of love towards him and longing to meet him, that is a good thing.""(Al-Liqa’ ash-Shahri\xa0 5/8).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/323358/is-it-prescribed-in-islam-to-make-oneself-weep-during-prayer

Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah) to the House (Ka`bah) is a duty that mankind owes to Allah, those who can afford the expenses (for one’s conveyance, provision and residence).” [Al `Imran 3:97]\nIt is not permissible for her to travel for Hajj or for any other purpose unless she is accompanied by her husband or a Mahram , because of the report narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim from Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him), that he heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “No man should be alone with a woman unless her Mahram is present, and no woman should travel unless she has a Mahram with her .”\xa0 A man stood up and said: “O Messenger of Allah, my wife has gone out for Hajj, and I have enlisted for such and such a campaign.” He said: “Go and do Hajj with your wife.” This was also the view of Al-Hasan, An-Nakha’i, Ahmad, Is-Haq, Ibn Al-Mundhir and Ashab Al-ra’i, and it is the correct view, because of the verse quoted, as well as the general meaning of the Hadiths which forbid a woman to travel without her husband or a Mahram. Malik, Ash-Shafi`i and Al-Awza`i held a different opinion and each of them stipulated a condition (allowing her to do that), but with no evidence. Ibn Al-Mundhir said: they did not follow the apparent meaning of the Hadith, and each of them stipulated a condition (allowing her to do that), but with no evidence.” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah lil-Buhuth Al-`Ilmiyyah wal-‘Ifta’, 11/90, 91)\xa0\nAnd they said:\xa0\n“If the situation is as described – that it is not easy for your husband or a Mahram of yours to travel with you to perform the obligation of Hajj – then you are not obliged to do it so long as this is the case, because the accompaniment of your husband or Mahram on the journey for Hajj is one of the conditions of Hajj being obligatory for you. It is prohibited for you to travel for Hajj or for any other purpose without that, even if you go with your brother’s wife and a group of women, according to the correct scholarly view, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “No woman should travel except with a Mahram.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim). That is unless your brother also travels with his wife, in which case it is permissible to travel with him, because he is a Mahram for you. Strive to do righteous deeds that do not need you to travel, and be patient in the hope that Allah will make things easier for you and enable you to go for Hajj with your husband or Mahram.” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah lil-Buhuth Al-`Ilmiyyah wal-‘Ifta’, 11/96)\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/25841/umrah-without-a-mahram
