273235,"There is something that is worrying me, and I do not know the ruling on it. I am a young man and I have a shop for repairing household appliances, mostly fridges, washing machines and air conditioning units. The place where I work is not big, and often I end up with a lot of fridges and washing machines whose owners don’t come to collect them, and don’t want them to be fixed. I wait, sometimes for a year, sometimes for two years, and they do not come, then because the place is full and there is no room to receive the appliances whose owners want them to be fixed, I have no choice but to dismantle them and throw them away. Sometimes I leave them outside the shop for a month or more, and they do not come to collect them, so I throw them away. Sometimes I take parts from them, if they are good enough to use. After more than a year or two, some of them come to ask about their appliances, and I tell them that were it not that I was forced to throw them away because the place is too small, I would not have thrown them away. Some of them accept the situation, and some of them say to me: I will not forgive that; I want my appliance. Sometimes, when I know where the owner of the broken appliance lives, who did not ask about it for a year, I even rent a truck at my own expense to deliver it to their houses for them. But sometimes, I do not know who the owner is, because they leave the appliances outside the shop and I find them, and keep them for more than six months, then if the owner does not show up, I throw them away. I want to know the Islamic ruling on my situation. Are the appliances that I throw away regarded as a trust that has been left with me, and is it not permissible to dispose of them? If the answer is yes, then is there a particular length of time for which I should keep them? If it is not permissible, then please tell me and advise me, because I am confused, and I do not want to incur the wrath of Allah, may He be exalted, or be one of those who consume people’s wealth unlawfully.","['Praise be to Allah.The appliances that the owners bring to you to fix are regarded as a trust that is left with you, and you must keep them and look after them until their owners come to collect them.\nBut if the owner of the appliance is later than usual in coming to collect his appliance after you have fixed it, and you have lost hope that he will return, or his leaving the appliance is detrimental to your business because you do not have much room, or because it is difficult to keep them and alike:\nin this case you have the right, on the grounds of warding off harm from yourself, to sell these appliances at the market price, and take from that your fee as agreed upon with the customer, and set the rest of that money aside. Then if the owner comes along some day, you can give the remaining money back to him.\nThe fatwa committee of the al-Fiqh al-Islami (Islamic jurisprudence) website said: He must wait for the length of time after which he thinks it most likely that the owner will never come back to collect it, then he may dispose of it and take in full his fee, and the rent for the place according to custom or agreement, then if anything is left it belongs to the owner; if he shows up he should give it back to him, and if he does not show up, it is permissible for him to make use of it, but he remains liable for replacing it, and if he keeps it [without making use of it] to be on the safe side, that is better.\nThis is what he must do on the basis of the general Islamic principle that harm must be removed. It is well known that keeping these items in the shop and not receiving any fee for his work causes great harm to the owner of the workshop or laundry service, especially if he needs parts and the like, and he also needs to pay his workers’ wages and rent for the shop, and he may be forced to turn away other work because he does not have space to store the items.\nThe matter is exacerbated if this happens repeatedly with more than one customer. All of that causes serious harm to the owner of the shop, and it justifies his disposing of these items by selling them.\nOur advice to you is:\nYou should put a clause in the contract, or write it on a piece of paper that you post in a prominent place in your shop, so that the customers can see it, stating that appliances will be disposed of after a certain period that you think is appropriate to both parties, if the owners do not come to collect them.\nAfter the end of that period, you are not obliged to keep them, and it is permissible for you to dispose of them by selling them, then taking your fee and giving the rest of the money in charity, or by giving them in charity as is, or getting rid of them if they are not fit to give in charity or sell.\nBut it would be better to write down the phone number, contact details or email of the owner of each appliance, and the date you received the appliance, then before the end of that period, you can contact him to warn him that you are not responsible for his appliance if he does not come and collect it. If he does come and collect it, all well and good, otherwise you may dispose of it as explained above.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/273235/what-should-owners-of-repair-shops-do-with-appliances-whose-owners-leave-them-there-for-a-long-time
401709,"I do Muay Thai, and I love martial arts in general. I would love to become a trainer when I finish my studies, but if I work as a trainer, I will be required to enter students into competitions, I have read a fatwa which says that fighting in competitions is not permissible, because it involves striking the face, which is forbidden. So is it permissible for me to become a trainer, or not? If I become a trainer, and someone comes to train with me, then I tell him that I do not allow students to enter competitions, will I be sinning?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nRuling on martial arts\nThere is nothing wrong with practising martial arts, if they are free of the following matters, which are objectionable according to Islamic teachings:\n1.\xa0Doing anything that is haram, such as striking the face and head, or causing harm to one’s competitor.\nIt says in a statement of the Islamic Fiqh Council belonging to the Muslim World League in Makkah al-Mukarramah regarding the topic of boxing, freestyle wrestling and bullfighting: The Council is unanimously agreed that the boxing mentioned, in the way in which it is actually practised in boxing rings and competitions in our country today, is a sport that is haram according to Islamic teachings, because it is based on allowing each contestant to cause extreme physical harm to the other, which could result in blindness, acute or chronic damage to the brain, severe fractures, or even death, without any liability on the part of the one who hit him. In addition to that, there is the joy and excitement that the audience who support the winner show at what happened to his opponent of harm. This is a haram action which is completely and utterly rejected by Islam, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{and do not throw [yourselves] with your [own] hands into destruction}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:195]\n{And do not kill yourselves [or one another]. Indeed, Allah is to you ever Merciful}\xa0[an-Nisa’ 4:29].\nBased on that, the Islamic jurists have stated that if someone allowed someone else to shed his blood and said to him: Kill me, it is not permissible for him to kill him, and if he does that, then he is responsible and deserves to be punished.\nBased on that, the Council affirms that it is not permissible for this boxing to be described as a sport, and it is not permissible to engage in it, because the concept of sport is based on exercise without causing harm or injury. It should be removed from local sports programs and it should be disallowed to participate in international contests in it. The Council also states that it is not permissible, according to Islamic teachings, to broadcast boxing matches on TV, so that the new generation will not learn this bad practice or try to imitate it.\nAs for freestyle wrestling, in which each contestant is allowed to cause harm or injury to the other, the Council thinks that it is very similar to boxing, which has been mentioned above, even though its format is different, because all the objectionable matters referred to in the case of boxing are also to be found in the case of freestyle wrestling, which is done in contests, so it come under the same ruling of prohibition.\nEnd quote.\n2.\xa0Uncovering of ‘awrahs. The ‘awrah of men is from the navel to the knee.\n3.\xa0Mixing between the sexes, which includes training girls.\n4.\xa0Distraction from remembrance of Allah and causing people to miss prayers and other obligatory duties.\n5.\xa0Bowing to other participants or trainers.\n6.\xa0Odd and deviant ideas and anything connected to idolatrous religions.\n7.\xa0Music, drums and other musical instruments when engaging in this sport.\nIf the sport is free of these objectionable matters, there is nothing wrong with engaging in it.\nSecondly:\nRuling on Muay Thai\nMuay Thai, or Thai kickboxing, includes a number of the objectionable matters mentioned above, such as striking the face, causing harm or injury to one’s opponent, uncovering ‘awrahs, and using musical instruments.\nIt is not permissible to engage in this sport unless you avoid these objectionable matters.\nThirdly:\nRuling on working as a martial arts trainer\nThere is nothing wrong with a person working as a martial arts trainer if he can make learners avoid these evils. If he cannot do that, then it is not permissible for him, because in that case his work will come under the heading of cooperating in sin. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And cooperate in righteousness and piety, but do not cooperate in sin and transgression. And fear Allah; indeed, Allah is severe in penalty}\xa0[al-Ma’idah 5:2].\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/401709/ruling-on-working-as-a-martial-arts-trainer-such-as-in-the-sport-of-muay-thai
