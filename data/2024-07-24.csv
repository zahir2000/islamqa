509169,"My sister’s husband is foul-mouthed; he reviles and berates her in the worst of phrases, beats her and always threatens to kill her and threatens to harm my older brother for no reason. He causes trouble for no reason, like one who is mentally disturbed. Please note that she is the one who spends on him and on the house, as she pays for rent, food and clothing. She has five children, and he is unemployed; he does not want to work even though he is in good health. Is it permissible to advise her to seek a divorce from him, because she fears for her life and the life of her children, or does this come under the heading of creating troubles between spouses?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIf the situation is as described in the question, undoubtedly this is one of the troubles of life. It is not appropriate for a man whom Allah has enjoined to be in charge of his household, spend on them and shoulder the responsibility of raising his children to be like this. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Each of you is in a position of responsibility and each of you is answerable for those under his care. A man is in a position of responsibility over his household and is answerable for those under his care. A woman is in a position of responsibility over her husband’s house and children and is answerable for those under her care. Indeed, each of you is in a position of responsibility and each of you is answerable for those under his care.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (2278).\nIt is well known that the woman has the right to ask for divorce (talaq) or khul‘ if there is a reason for that. It was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the wife of Thabit ibn Qays came to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and said: “O Messenger of Allah, I do not find any fault with Thaabit ibn Qays in his character or his religious commitment, but I do not want to commit any act of disbelief after becoming a Muslim.” The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to her, “Will you give back his garden [that he had given to her as the mahr]?” She said, “Yes.” So the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to Thaabit: “Take back your garden, and divorce her.”\xa0\nWhat is meant by her words “but I do not want to commit any act of disbelief after becoming a Muslim” is: I do not want to do any actions that are contrary to the rulings of Islam, such as despising my husband, disobeying him, not fulfilling his rights, and so on.\nSee: Fath al-Bari (9/400).\nShaykh Ibn Jibrin (may Allah have mercy on him) said, explaining what justifies seeking khul‘:\nIf the woman dislikes her husband’s characteristics, such as if he is harsh, strict, short-tempered, filled with anger, criticizes the slightest action and rebukes her for the slightest shortcoming, then she has the right to seek khul‘.\nSecondly: if she dislikes his appearance, such as a flaw, a defect, or a deficiency in his senses, then she has the right to seek khul‘.\nThirdly: if he is lacking in religious commitment, such as if he does not pray or is careless about attending prayers in congregation, or he breaks the fast of Ramadan with no excuse, or he goes to places where haram activities take place, such as zina, drinking, listening to music and entertainment, and the like, then she has the right to seek khul‘.\nFourthly: If he deprives her of her rights, such as maintenance, clothing or essential needs, when he is able to provide those things, then she has the right to seek khul‘.\nFifthly: If he does not give her her right to regular intimacy in a way that will keep her chaste because he is impotent, or has no interest in her, or he prefers someone else, or he is not fair in sharing his time [among co-wives], then she has the right to seek khul‘. And Allah knows best. End quote.\nSee also the answer to question no. 1859 .\nSecondly:\nAs your sister is the one who is in charge, and she knows her husband’s condition better than anyone, she is the one who should decide whether it is better to stay with him for the sake of the children despite these annoyances, because the presence of the father and the sense of family unity has a positive psychological impact on the children, gives them a good social standing and it helps in giving them a good upbringing, and in many cases it is better than separation.\nWe should also note that our advice should differ, depending on whether the couple have children or not. Making sacrifices for the sake of the children’s safety, their social standing, their psychological wellbeing and sense of family is worth patience and sacrifice.\nShe should also persist in calling upon Allah, asking Him to rectify his condition, and she should ask sincere and knowledgeable people to advise him. For hearts fluctuate, and they are in the hand of Allah. How many people have come back to their senses and settled down after having gone astray and misbehaved.\nIf there is anyone among his family and relatives who is rational and mature in thinking, and is held in high esteem by him and can influence him, then she can seek his help to influence him and tell him about his situation, if there is the hope that this will help to rectify his condition.\nWhat appears to us to be the case is that if your sister shows patience, which is indicative of her rational mind and far-sightedness, no one should interfere by advising her to leave him, which could cause greater harm than the harm that results from her staying with this husband despite the problems he has.\nBut if she fears for her life, her faith or her children, then let her do that; there is nothing wrong with her seeking separation from him in that case.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/509169/my-sister-is-suffering-because-of-her-husband-can-i-advise-her-to-seek-a-divorce
236653,"What is the ruling on watching some programs, including Islamic ones, on unofficial YouTube channels? They were originally TV programs, and some of them are on channels which write “All rights reserved” on their programs; in the case of some other channels, I do not know whether they put copyright on their programs are not.","['Praise be to Allah.Academic material, inventions, books, programs and apps usually write “All rights reserved” at the beginning. What is meant by this phrase is that the intellectual property rights and patents connected to this product are protected and reserved for the author or producer of this work.\nSome scholars have stated that reserving rights for the authors or producers does not mean that it is not allowed to copy these products, or to watch them, photocopy them or download them – in whatever format – if that is done for the purpose of personal benefit.\nBut if the aim is to make a profit and trade in that product, by publishing and distributing it, that is prohibited, because it is a transgression against the financial rights of the author or producer.\nWe have previously discussed the Islamic rulings on this issue in the answers to questions no. 237588 and 226230 .\nBased on that, there is nothing wrong with listening to and watching these programs, and benefitting from what they contain of goodness. It is all the same whether the authors stated that all rights are reserved for them or not.\nIf there is any sin, it is on the one who published or posted it, not on the viewer.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/236653/ruling-on-watching-tv-programs-on-youtube-when-the-producers-of-some-of-them-have-claimed-copyright
21524,"Some people believe that the Prophet Muhammad [(peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)] is ""Shaheed"" and is in BArzakh where he can hear us if we send 'durood' on him and also if we ask his 'wasta' [by virtue of his closeness to Allah] in praying to God.","['Praise be to Allah.Is Prophet Muhammad alive?\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is alive in his grave in the sense of the life of Al-Barzakh , so he enjoys the blessings that Allah has prepared for him as a reward for his great good actions that he did in this world. But the life in the grave is not like the life of this world, or the life in the Hereafter. Rather it is the life of Al-Barzakh which comes in between his life in this world and his life in the Hereafter. Hence we know that he died as other Prophets and other people before him died. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And We granted not to any human being immortality before you (O Muhammad); then if you die, would they live forever?” [Al-Anbiya’ 21:34]\xa0\n“Whatsoever is on it (the earth) will perish. And the Face of your Lord full of Majesty and Honour will remain forever.” [Ar-Rahman 55:26,27]\n“Verily, you (O Muhammad) will die, and verily, they (too) will die.” [Az-Zumar 39:30]\nAnd there are other verses which also indicate that Allah caused him to die. Moreover, the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) washed him, shrouded him, offered the funeral prayer for him and buried him; if he had been alive in the worldly sense, they would not have done the same as is done for others who die.\xa0\nFatimah (may Allah be pleased with her) asked Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) for her inheritance from her father (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) because she was convinced that he had died, and no one among the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) differed with her concerning that. Rather Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) responded to her request by saying that nothing could be inherited from the Prophets. \xa0\nThe Companions agreed unanimously to choose a caliph for the Muslims to succeed the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him),\xa0and that was done with the appointment of Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) as a caliph. If the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had been alive in a worldly sense, they would not have done that. So this indicates that there was consensus among them that he had indeed died.\xa0\nWhen the tribulations (Fitan) and problems increased during the time of `Uthman and `Ali (may Allah be pleased with them both), and before and after that, they did not go to his grave to consult him or ask him for a way out of those tribulations and problems, or the way to solve them. If he had been alive in a worldly sense, they would not have overlooked that when they were in such great need of someone to save them from the trials that surrounded them. \xa0\nWith regard to the soul of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), it is in the highest part of `Illiyyin, because he is the best of creation, and because Allah has given him Al-Wasilah which is the highest position in Paradise.\xa0\nThe life of Al-Barzakh is a special life. The Prophets and the martyrs are alive in Al-Barzakh as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The Prophets are alive and they pray in their graves.” (Narrated by Al-Mundhiri and Al-Bayhaqi who classed it as authentic because of corroborating reports in Al-Bukhari and Muslim.)\xa0\nAllah Says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And say not of those who are killed in the way of Allah, `They are dead.’ Nay, they are living, but you perceive (it) not.” [Al-Baqarah 2:154]\nThis is a special life, the nature of which is known to Allah. It is not like the life of this world in which the soul remains with the body. \xa0\nCan Prophet Muhammad hear us?\nThe basic principle concerning the dead is that they do not hear the words of the living sons of Adam, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“but you cannot make hear those who are in graves.” [Fatir 35:22]\nAllah confirmed that those whom he (the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)) was calling to Islam could not hear, by likening them to the dead. There is nothing in the Quran or in the authentic Sunnah to indicate that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) can hear every Du`a or call from human beings. Rather it is proven that the only thing that reaches him (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the blessings and Salams of those who send blessings and Salams upon him .\xa0\nThis was narrated by Abu Dawud, 2041, with a sound chain of transmission from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no one who sends Salams upon me but Allah will restore to me my soul so that I may return his Salams.” This does not mean that he hears the words of the one who sends Salams. Rather it is possible that he comes to know of those Salams when the angels convey that to him. If we assume that he hears the words of the one who sends Salams, this is an exception from the general rule, as in the case of the dead hearing the footsteps of those who carry his bier, and as in the case of the slain disbelievers in the well at Badr who heard the call of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when he said to them: “Have you found your Lord’s promise to be true? For we have found our Lord’s promise to be true.” (See Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 1/313, 318, 321)\xa0\nIs calling upon Prophet Muhammad permissible?\nWith regard to calling upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and asking him directly, this is the essence of polytheism which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was sent to forbid and to fight against its people.\xa0\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 111019 , 10289 ,\xa011402 ,\xa0and 1439 .\xa0\nWe ask Allah to bring the Muslims back to the right path. And Allah knows best. May Allah send blessings and peace upon his Prophet Muhammad and his family and Companions.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21524/can-prophet-muhammad-hear-us
