459184,"My menses stopped three or four years ago, but suddenly, two days ago, I found a dark discharge (like the discharge at the beginning of menses) in the vagina, but it was only inside.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe basic principle is that the blood that comes out of a woman is menstrual blood, even if her menses had stopped for several years, or she has reached the age of fifty or older, because there is no defined age for menopause, according to the more correct scholarly view. Allah has connected the rulings on menses to the presence of adha (“harm”), which refers to the blood, so when there is blood, it is assumed to be menses, unless the bleeding lasts for longer than fifteen days, in which case it becomes istihadah (non-menstrual bleeding).\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And they ask you about menstruation. Say, ""It is harm, so keep away from wives during menstruation. And do not approach them until they are pure. And when they have purified themselves, then come to them from where Allah has ordained for you. Indeed, Allah loves those who are constantly repentant and loves those who purify themselves}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:222].\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: There is no specified age after which women stop menstruating. Rather, even if we assume that a woman sees the usual type of blood coming from the womb after the age of sixty or seventy, it is to be regarded as menses. The menopause mentioned in the verse (interpretation of the meaning) {And those who no longer expect menstruation among your women} [al-Talaq 65:4] is not referring to a particular age. If it was referring to a particular age, then Allah and His Messenger would have explained that. Rather the verse is speaking of a woman who thinks that she will no longer menstruate. Once her menses stops and she no longer expects it to return, then she “no longer expects menstruation,” even if she is forty years old. Then if she spent some time without menses, and the bleeding comes back, then it becomes clear that she had not reached menopause.""(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa\xa019/240).\nSecondly:\nMenstrual blood may be black, red or brown.\nIt was narrated from Fatimah bint Abi Hubaysh that she suffered from istihadah (irregular menstrual bleeding), so the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to her: “When it is menstrual blood, it is dark and recognisable, so when that happens, stop praying…” Narrated by Abu Dawud (286); classed as hasan by al-Albani in Sahih Sunan Abi Dawud.\nAl-Khatib al-Sharbini said: “Its colour” that is, of the strong blood, “is black”, then red, which is weak in comparison to the black blood, and is strong in comparison to the brown. The brown is stronger than the yellow, which is stronger than the brownish colour. That which has an unpleasant smell is stronger than that which has no smell, and that which is viscous is stronger than that which is thin and black.""(Al-Iqna‘\xa0 1/95).\nThirdly:\nIf the blood is inside the vagina, then it is menses, and there is no stipulation that it should come out. The presence of blood inside indicates that something has come out from the womb, which is menses.\nIbn Abi Shaybah narrated in al-Musannaf (1/90) with his isnad that ‘Amrah bint ‘Abd al-Rahman al-Madaniyyah (d. 98 AH) – one of the female jurists of the generation of the Tabi‘in – used to say to the women: If one of you inserts a piece of cloth and it comes out changed, then do not pray until you do not see anything.\nIt says in Matalib Uli al-Nuha (1/166): “Similar to that” – that is, the movement of semen – “is the movement of menstrual blood.” This was stated by Shaykh Taqiy al-Din. This ruling applies when sensing its movement inside the body as when it comes out. So if the woman feels the movement of menstrual blood just before sunset, and she is fasting, then her fast is broken, even if the blood does not come out until after sunset. End quote.\nIbn Hajar al-Haytami (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Blood inside the vagina – which is blood that does not come out when squatting on one’s heels – is menses, if that occurs at the time when menses is due…\nThe ruling concerning menses and the rulings that result from its presence are connected to awareness of the presence of blood in the vagina at the time when it is possible for menses to occur, so that if it is present, that time is deemed to be menses, otherwise it is not…\nMenses comes and goes, so when the blood is present in the vagina, then the rulings on menses come into effect, even if it does not come out.""(Al-Fatawa al-Fiqhiyyah al-Kubra\xa0 1/76).\nBased on that, you did well by not praying when you were menstruating. And your menses continues until you see that you have become pure with the cessation of bleeding, or dryness, or the white discharge, unless the bleeding lasts for more than fifteen days, after which you should do ghusl, pray and act in accordance with the rulings on istihadah.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/459184/her-menses-stopped-years-ago-then-she-saw-dark-blood-is-this-regarded-as-menses
101752,"I have embraced Islam – praise be to Allah – and I have three children; I come from a Christian family that is tolerant of my being Muslim. My question is: how can I introduce Islam to my children, one of whom is eleven years old, the other is eight years old, and my daughter is five years old, without forcing them?","['Praise be to Allah.Welcome to Islam\xa0\nWe praise Allah for having enabled you to enter Islam and we ask Him, may He be Exalted, to make you steadfast and to guide your family to this religion.\xa0We advise you not to be careless or lazy about guiding and teaching them, in the way that is best, in the hope that Allah will grant you the joy of seeing them enter Islam, and decree for you a reward equal to the reward for their good deeds.\xa0\nYou have done well to ask about your children and how to raise them in Islam . Allah, may He be Exalted, has placed a great deal of responsibility on parents’ shoulders for the upbringing of their children .\xa0\n`Abdullah ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “Each of you is a shepherd and each of you is responsible for his flock. The ruler is a shepherd and is responsible for his flock. A man is the shepherd of his household and is responsible for his flock. A woman is the shepherd of her husband’s house” (Narrated by Al-Bukhaari, 853 and Muslim, 1829)\xa0\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Whoever neglects to teach his son that which will benefit him, and ignores him, has done something very bad indeed. Most children go astray because of their parents who neglect them and fail to teach them the duties and Sunnahs of their religion. They neglect them when they are young so they do not benefit themselves or benefit their parents when they grow up.” (Tuhfat Al-Ahwadhi, p. 229)\xa0\nHow converts introduce Islam to their children\nWe advise you to upbring your children upon Islam by introducing Islam to them and making it appealing to them; this can be achieved by different means, including the following:\xa0\nCreate a connection between them and the Arabic language, and instil a love for it in their hearts, because it is an important key to understanding and loving Islam.\nHelp them get to know friends of their own age and background who are practising Muslims. It is essential that these friends should be of good character and righteous, so that they can influence your children and be an example for them in their righteousness and adherence to Islam, and the manner in which they interact with their parents.\nThe Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The likeness of a good companion and a bad companion is that of one who carries musk and one who works the bellows. With the carrier of musk, either he will give you some or you will buy some from him, or you will smell a good scent from him; as for the one who works the bellows, either he will burn your clothes or you will smell a bad scent from him.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhaari, 1995 and Muslim, 2628)\xa0\nMake them feel an attachment to the mosque, by encouraging them to pray and attend classes; you can also make that attractive to them and encourage them by giving them gifts and prizes every time one of them shows some progress in his or her classes.\nIt is also a good idea for you to go with them to the mosque, to encourage them to go there and pray.\xa0\nIf it is not easy for them to go to the mosque because it is far away or the route is not safe, then do not neglect to teach them to pray on time at home. There is a binding instruction (from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) to teach those who reach the age of seven to pray and to make them do it; before this age they may be taught but not by way of making them do it.\xa0\nThe Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Instruct your children to pray when they are seven years old and smack them if they do not do it when they are ten, and separate them in their beds.” (Narrated by Abu Dawood, 495; classed as authentic by Al-Albaani in Sahih Abu Dawud)\nLet them hear the Quran recited in beautiful voices, so that the Quran will be held in high esteem in their hearts. The Book of Allah is a Book of guidance and light for people, which will illuminate the way for them and make them steadfast in adhering to the straight path, by Allah’s leave.\nWatch Islamic cartoons and movies so that they can compare what they see and hear in them with what they see and hear in other movies. Here you have an important role to play in explaining the differences between the two, and highlight how Islam encourages people to do good, uphold ties of kinship, show kindness and be merciful, and it forbids evil, severing ties of kinship, corruption and hardheartedness.\nShow them Islamic websites that will be beneficial for them, each according to his age and whilst being careful not to let them roam freely on the internet; rather that should be through you.\nSomething that you should think about seriously and that will help you in what you are seeking to achieve is taking them to do `Umrah and visit the sacred House of Allah, for these visits have a far-reaching impact on the hearts of young people as is also the case with adults.\nTeach them the basic principles of belief in a simple and straightforward manner according to their ages, such as the Oneness of Allah, may He be Exalted, and that He can hear them and see them, and that He rewards for good deeds and adhering to the rulings of Islam\nThe fact that `Abdullah ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) was very young did not prevent the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) from saying to him eloquent words about Tawhid and `Aqidah (belief). It was narrated that Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I was [riding] behind the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) one day and he said: “O young man, I shall teach you some words (of advice): be mindful of Allah, and Allah will protect you. Be mindful of Allah, and you will find Him in front of you. If you ask, ask of Allah; if you seek help, seek help of Allah. Know that if the nation were to gather together to benefit you with anything, it would benefit you only with something that Allah had already decreed for you, and that if they were to gather together to harm you with anything, they would only harm you with something Allah had already decreed for you. The pens have been lifted and the pages have dried.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 2516; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Tirmidhi.)\nPresent stories appropriate to their ages from the biography of the Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his noble Companions (may Allah be pleased with them), so that they will know that they belong to the best religion, the best Prophet, the best nation.\nPut them in Islamic schools and keep them away from corrupt schools , so that the Islamic schools can take care of their beliefs and conduct; choose the best of them according to what you see fit.\nImportant matters to be mindful of\nYou should not be careless about two important matters:\xa0\nPray that Allah help them and guide them ; your supplication will be an important means of their being guided, so do not neglect it and do not think little of it.\xa0\nYou should be a good example for them in treating them kindly and showing compassion towards them. That is not only part of motherhood; it is also part of being a Muslim who adheres to the religion of Allah, may He be Exalted.\xa0\nWe ask Allah to help you to do that which is good and to guide your children to that which He loves and which pleases Him.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/101752/how-should-converts-introduce-islam-to-their-children
473586,Do children see the angels or the jinn?,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nSeeing the angels, in a form other than their true form in which Allah created them, is possible. It is proven that a number of the Sahabah saw the angels in human form, as was also proven among nations who came before us.\nAs for seeing the angels in their real form, there is no report regarding that except reports which say that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) saw Jibril [in his real form] twice, and he was stunned by what he saw of his great size in his real form.\nIt was narrated that ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Whilst we were with the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) one day, a man came to us whose garment was exceedingly white and whose hair was exceedingly black, and there were no signs of travel on him, and none of us knew who he was. He came and sat before the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), resting his knees against his and placing his hands on his thighs. He said: O Muhammad, tell me about Islam…. And the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “O ‘Umar, do you know who that questioner was?” I said: Allah and His Messenger know best. He said: “That was Jibril, who came to you to teach you your religion.” Muslim (8).\nIt was narrated that Sa‘d ibn Abi Waqqas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: On the day of Uhud, I saw on the right of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and on his left two men wearing white garments, fighting fiercely to defend him, and I never saw them before or since. Muslim (2306). These two men were angels.\nAl-Suyuti (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Al-Nawawi said: From this hadith, we understand that seeing the angels is not only for the prophets; rather the Sahabah and the awliya’ (close friends of Allah) have seen them, and they did not fight only on the day of Badr.""(Sharh al-Suyuti ‘ala Muslim\xa05/317).\nAnother example is Jibril (peace be upon him) appearing to Maryam (peace be upon her), and the hadith about the angel who appeared to the bald man, the leper and the blind man, and other sound texts.\nOn our website we have previously given a detailed answer regarding this topic. Please see question no. 96661 .\nSecondly:\nSeeing the jinn – also in a form other than their real form – is also possible. Examples of that include the following:\nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) appointed me to guard the Ramadan zakah. Someone came and started taking some of the food. I grabbed hold of him and said, ‘I am going to take you to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)!’ He said, ‘Let me be, for I am in need and I have children and am in great need.’ So I let him go. … At the end of the hadith it says: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘He indeed told you the truth, although he is a liar. Do you know who you have been speaking with for the past three nights, O Abu Hurayrah?’ I said, ‘No.’ He said, ‘That was a shaytan (a devil).’” Muslim (2187).\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: What we learn from this hadith… is that the Shaytan may appear in different forms, so it is possible to see him. The words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning), {Indeed, he sees you, he and his tribe, from where you do not see them} [al-A‘raf 7:27] refer to when he is in his original form with which he was created.""(Fath al-Bari by Ibn Hajar\xa0 4/489).\nThus we know that seeing the angels and the jinn in a form other than their real form is possible and does happen.\nAs for suggesting that only children can see that, we do not know of any text which speaks of that. This is a matter of the unseen, and we cannot say anything about it except on the basis of evidence, and there is no evidence to deny or affirm that.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/473586/do-nursing-infants-see-the-angels-and-the-jinn
307722,"We know that there are situations in which we should ask permission to enter inside and outside the house, but could you give us more details on these situations, such as when entering the kitchen or living room, or entering the house? Because my students have asked me these questions. And is it permissible to praise other people?","[""Praise be to Allah.Why Seek permission before entering someone’s house?\nAllah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0“O you who have believed, do not enter houses other than your own houses until you ascertain welcome and greet their inhabitants. That is best for you; perhaps you will be reminded” [An-Nur 24:27].\nShaykh As-Sa`di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Here Allah instructs His believing slaves not to enter houses other than their own without asking permission , because that leads to a number of bad consequences, including that to which the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) referred when he said: “Asking permission has only been prescribed so that one will not see that which is not appropriate for him to see.” Because not following this ruling properly may lead to one’s gaze falling upon private things inside other people’s houses. A person’s house, by covering what is private inside its walls, is like a garment that covers what is private of his body.\nEntering other people’s houses without permission may create suspicion about the one who enters them, and he may be accused of evil deeds such as stealing and so on, because entering houses surreptitiously is suggestive of evil intent. Allah forbids the believers to enter houses other than their own until they seek permission; the word used in the original Arabic suggests that seeking permission creates a sense of assurance, whereas entering without permission may cause alarm.\n“and greet their inhabitants” – the manner in which this is to be done is mentioned in the Hadith: “As-salaamu `alaykum (peace be upon you); may I come in?”\n“That” namely seeking permission to enter “is best for you; perhaps you will be reminded”, because it will serve many interests, and because it is part of the noble characteristics that are required of the Muslim. If he is given permission, then he may enter.” (Tafsir As-Sa`di\xa0(565)\nWhen to seek permission to enter someone's house?\nAs for the details of situations in which one should ask permission to enter, in\xa0Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah Al-Kuwaitiyyah\xa0(3/145 ff), this matter is discussed in detail; we may sum it up and make it clearer by noting the following points:\n\nIf someone wants to enter a house, that house is either his house or it is not his house. If it is his house, it is either empty, and no one else lives there except him; or his wife is in it on her own; or she has one of his Mahrams with her, such as his sister, daughter, mother and so on.\n\nIf the house is his house, and no one else is living in it, then he may enter without asking anyone for permission , because permission is his, and asking oneself for permission is a kind of foolishness; Islamic teaching is far above such nonsense.\n\nIf his wife is in the house and no one else is with her, then he does not have to ask permission to enter, because it is permissible for him to see all of her body. However, it is recommended for him to ask permission to enter by clearing his throat, stamping his feet so that his shoes make noise and the like, because she may be in a situation in which she does not want her husband to see her.\nIf one of his Mahrams is in the house– such as his mother, sister and so on – whom he is not allowed to see naked, then it is not permissible for him to enter without asking permission. Details of that are mentioned in some scenarios.\nIf the house is not his house, and he wants to enter it, then he must ask permission, and it is not permissible for him to enter before permission is given to him, according to scholarly consensus, whether the door of the house is open or closed.\n\nExceptions to the obligation to ask permission to enter houses in general include the following:\n\nEntering non-residential buildings [such as shops and the like], if that serves a useful purpose. It is permissible to enter them without asking permission, based on the fact that there is general permission to enter them. There are some differences of opinion regarding the details of the definition of such buildings.\nEntering a house in order to save a life or some property, when asking permission and waiting for permission could result in loss of life or property.\n\n\nThe basic principle is that it is not permissible for a person to dispose of or use the property of someone else, or dispose of something belonging to someone else, except with permission from the Lawgiver or from the owner of the property. In that case, it is not a transgression. So it is not permissible to eat someone else’s food except with the permission of its owner, or in the case of necessity, and it is not permissible to live in someone else’s house except with his permission.\nOne who is in a subordinate position asking permission to enter the space of one who is in a position of authority. This is a matter that depends on custom, meaning that if it is known that the teacher, for example, does not allow the students to enter the classroom without permission, then they must ask permission to enter, because positions of authority are given to protect common interests, and seeking permission to enter from the one in authority, in the place in which he has authority, is something that is very important, so that things may be managed properly and chaos may be avoided. This matter is broad in scope.\nA guest should ask permission before leaving his host’s house.\nIf someone wants to sit down between two men, he should ask them for permission first.\nIf someone wants to look in a book in which there is something that is private belonging to someone else, he must ask him for permission before looking.\n\nWhen is seeking permission to enter someone's house waived?\nThe requirement to ask permission may be waived for several reasons, including the following:\n\nWhen it is not possible to give permission:\n\nThe requirement to ask permission may be waived when it is not possible to give permission for some reason, such as if the one who could give permission has died, or he is travelling far away, or he has been detained and prevented from meeting anyone, and something needs to be done that cannot be delayed until he returns from his travel, or is released from detention, and the like.\n\nWarding off harm:\n\nThe requirement to ask permission is waived if asking permission could result in harm. Therefore it is permissible to sell items that may otherwise be damaged or ruined, that have been left with someone for safekeeping, without asking permission of their owners. And it is permissible to enter a house without asking permission, if doing so will prevent a crime from occurring.\n\nAttaining some right that cannot be attained by asking for permission.\n\nThe requirement to ask permission is waived for the one who has a right, if asking for permission will cause his right to be lost. So it is permissible for a woman to take from her husband’s wealth whatever is sufficient for her and her children, on a reasonable basis, without asking permission, if he refuses to spend on her maintenance, for example.\nIs praising someone permissible in Islam?\nWith regard to praising other people, which means speaking highly of someone for some good that he did, or for some good characteristics that he possesses, that is permissible.\nSo if you say, “I praised So-and-so,” it means that you commended him for his good qualities.\nIn the Hadith it says: “He does not thank Allah who does not thank people.” (Narrated by Ahmad, 7939)\nThe kind of praise that it is not permissible to direct to anyone other than Allah is praising in an absolute sense.\nFor more information, please see the answers to questions no.\xa0146025 \xa0and\xa089945 \xa0.\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/307722/when-to-seek-permission-to-enter-someones-house
