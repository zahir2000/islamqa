500984,"Is it essential to memorise chains of narrations in the order of their hadiths, or is it sufficient to remember the names of the narrators?","['Praise be to Allah.The importance of the isnad (chain of narration) in determining which reports are sound and distinguishing them from those which are weak or false is well known.\nAl-Hakim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWere it not for the isnads and the hadith scholars seeking out the isnad for every hadith, and their extreme care in memorizing and preserving the isnads, the teachings of Islam would have been lost and the heretics and innovators would have been able to fabricate hadiths and tamper with the isnads. If the reports did not have isnads, they would be of no benefit.""(Ma‘rifat ‘Ulum al-Hadith\xa0 p. 115).\nAl-Qadi ‘Iyad (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nYou should understand, first of all, that the basis of the hadith is the isnad; through it the soundness of the hadith can be proven and it can be established whether the isnad is uninterrupted.""(Al-Ilma‘\xa0 p. 267).\nThus it becomes clear that learning the chains of narration through which the hadith texts were narrated, and studying them, is not essential for everyone. Rather it is required of the one who wants to learn the science of hadith and specialize in it, so that he can acquire the ability to distinguish between hadith reports and determine which are sound and which are weak. Such a person must pay attention to learning the isnads, either by memorizing them or constantly referring to the books of hadith in which the isnads are shown and researching the narrators of each hadith, until he develops skills and acquires knowledge of the narrators of hadith. The one who is ignorant about the narrators and lacks the skills to critique hadiths cannot be a scholar of hadith, no matter how much he memorizes of the texts.\nShaykh ‘Abd ar-Rahman al-Mu‘allimi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nA man cannot be called a scholar until he acquires knowledge and information about the narrators of hadith. In Tadrib ar-Rawi it says: Ar-Rafa‘i and others said: When the word scholar is mentioned, that will exclude those who hear the hadith but have no knowledge of the chains of narrators or the names of narrators.\nAz-Zarqani said: As for the scholars, in their view the title of hadith scholar (muhaddith) cannot be given to anyone except one who has memorized the texts of the hadith and knows the character of the narrators and is able to critique them.\nAt-Taj as-Subki said: … The hadith scholar is the one who knows the isnads and how to critique them, and knows the names of the narrators.\nIt was narrated from al-Mizzi that he was asked about who deserves to be called a hadith scholar, and he said: At a minimum, the number of narrators whom he knows, along with their biographies, circumstances and countries where they lived should be greater than the number of those whom he does not know, so that he can evaluate the hadith.\nSo the scholar needs to know the circumstances of those narrators who are his contemporaries, either by finding out about them directly or finding out about them from what trustworthy scholars have said about them. And he needs to learn about the character and circumstances of those narrators who came before him from what trustworthy scholars said about them, or from what trustworthy scholars narrated from other trustworthy scholars, and so on. And he must memorize all of that as he must memorize the hadith and its isnads. Thus some of them memorized thousands of hadiths, some of them memorized tens of thousands, and some of them memorized hundreds of thousands, along with their isnads.\nEnd quote from Muhadarah fi ‘Ilm ar-Rijal wa Ahammiyatuhu – in Athar al-Mu‘allimi (15/227).\nUndoubtedly, memorizing the isnads of hadiths as they appear in the books of hadith is better and more appropriate than memorizing the names on their own. That is for many reasons, the most important of which are:\n1.. Memorizing the hadith with its isnad, as it was narrated, helps one to remember the status of this hadith and whether it is sound or weak.\n2.. The one who memorizes the isnads as they are will acquire knowledge of the different levels or generations of the narrators, so he will learn about the shaykhs and students of each narrator. Learning about the levels or generations of the narrators is important, as is well known among specialists in this field, and it can solve many issues.\nAl-‘Iraqi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIt is important to learn about the levels and generations of narrators, because there may be two narrators with identical names, and one may think that only one person is referred to. But you can distinguish between them when you know the level or generation to which each of them belong, if they are of different levels. If they belonged to the same level or generation, the matter may be confusing, but knowing the shaykhs from whom they narrated or the students to whom they narrated will help one to differentiate between them. One of the two who have identical names may not have narrated from the same shaykhs as the other. But if they had the same shaykhs and the same students, in that case the matter is more confusing, and only people of knowledge could differentiate between them.\nBecause they lacked knowledge of the levels and generations of narrators, some scholars made mistakes and thought that a narrator was someone else, or they may have regarded a narrator as belonging to the wrong level or generation.""(Sharh at-Tabsirah wa’t-Tadhkirah\xa02/342-343).\n3.. Isnads should be memorised with the wording in which each narrator received the hadith and transmitted it to his students; and whether there was a clear statement such as “I heard” or “he narrated to us” or “he told us”, or that was not stated clearly and the report simply says “it was narrated from” and so on. All of this will enable the scholar to acquire the skill to differentiate between uninterrupted and interrupted isnads.\nConclusion:\nMemorizing the names of the narrators along with the chains of narration is the methodology that was adopted by the hadith scholars of the early generations and those who came after them, and it has proven to be very useful. The wise person will make the most of his time by following the method of learning and seeking knowledge which has been tried and tested.\nBut this is only required for specialists in this field and those who aspire to attain the pinnacle of this branch of knowledge. As for ordinary people, it is sufficient for them to memorize whatever they are able to of the texts – the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) – and to study those words and understand them.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/500984/how-important-is-it-to-memorise-the-isnads-chains-of-narration-of-hadiths
227441,"I know that the Quran is one of the attributes of Allah, like His Eye, His Hand and so on, and that it is the word of Allah in a real sense, that was sent down to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) through Jibril (peace be upon him), and that the Quran is not created. But what is meant by that? Does that mean that the words of Allah are not created, even when we read them, although we are created by Allah and everything we say or do is part of the creation of Allah? Is thinking in this way regarded as a kind of overstepping the mark? I do not want to do that, all I want is to ensure that my belief is sound.","['Praise be to Allah.Is the Quran Created?\nThe Quran is the word of Allah, may He be Exalted, and is not created . What is meant by that is that Allah, may He be exalted, spoke the words of the Quran, which Jibril (peace be upon him) heard from Him, and brought down to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and conveyed it to him.\xa0\nAll of the attributes of Allah, may He be Exalted, are uncreated; they are eternal, with no beginning. The words of Allah are among these attributes, and that includes the Quran. Therefore, the scholars said that the Quran is not created, because it is the words of Allah , and that is one of His attributes.\xa0\nAre people\'s actions created?\nWith regard to people\'s actions, they are created. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“While Allah has created you and what you do [or make].”\xa0[As-Saffat 37:96]\nThere are two issues that we must distinguish between:\xa0\n\nThe first is the words of Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, that He spoke initially, and Jibril (peace be upon him) heard them from Him, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) conveyed them to us. This is an attribute of Allah that is not created in its letters and words; the same applies to His voice with which Allah spoke initially, and Jibril (peace be upon him) heard it from Him.\xa0\n\nAll of this comes under the heading of the words of Allah, nothing of which is created, no matter how it is written, recited or heard.\xa0\n\nThe second is the actions of the person, who is the vessel which carries the words of Allah, so he writes them in a book, reads them and hears them. All that comes from a person and that he does is created.\xa0\n\nSo the hand of the person is created, the ink with which he writes is created, the paper on which he writes is created, the person\'s tongue is created, his voice that belongs to him is created. All of these are vessels in which people carry the word of Allah and transmit it and convey it.\xa0\nMore than one of the leading scholars have explained this issue and differentiated between these two matters. Foremost among them is the leader of hadith scholars, Imam Muhammad ibn Isma`il Al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him). He wrote a book on this specific topic entitled Khalq Af`al Al-`Ibad. Among other things he said in it (2/70):\xa0\n“Abu `Abdullah ibn Isma`il said: I heard `Ubaydullah ibn Sa`id say: I heard Yahya ibn Sa`id say: I always heard our companions say that people`s deeds are created.\xa0\nAbu `Abdullah said: Their movements, voices, actions and writing are created. As for the Quran that is recited, recorded in the Mus-haf, written, and memorised in people\'s hearts, it is the word of Allah and is not created. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Nay, but they, the clear Ayat (i.e., the description and the qualities of Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) written like verses in the Tawrat (Torah) and the Injil (Gospel)) are preserved in the breasts of those who have been given knowledge (from the people of the Scriptures)\nBut it is clear revelations in the hearts of those who have been given knowledge.”\xa0[Al-`Ankabut 29:49]\nIs-haq ibn Ibrahim said: ""As for the vessels, who would doubt that they are created?”\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \xa0\n“When we recite the Quran, we recite it with our voices that are created, that cannot resemble the voice of the Lord. The Quran that we recite is the word of Allah, conveyed from Him and not heard directly from Him. Rather we recite it with our voices. The words are the words of the Creator, but the voice is the sound of the reciter, as is indicated by the Quran and Sunnah, as well as common sense. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And if anyone of the Mushrikun (polytheists, idolaters, pagans, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah) seeks your protection then grant him protection, so that he may hear the Word of Allah (the Quran), and then escort him to where he can be secure.”\xa0[At-Tawbah 9:6]\nAnd the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Make the Quran beautiful with your voices.”\xa0 (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 12/98) (See also: Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 12/53)\xa0\nThe scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas said:\xa0\n“What we are required to believe concerning the Quran, which is the view of Ahl As-Sunnah wal Jama`ah, as indicated by the Quran and Sunnah, is that the Quran is the word of Allah in a true sense. Its letters and meanings were sent down, not created . It came from Him and will return to Him. It is the word of Allah, may He be exalted, when it is recited and when it is written.

So the words are the words of the Creator and the voice is the voice of the reciter.” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 3/21)\xa0\nFor more details on this issue, please see Mukhtasar As-Sawa`iq Al-Mursalah by Ibn Al-Qayyim (503-510)\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/227441/is-the-quran-created
469532,"If the father is well off and provides his family with all basic needs that are required according to Islamic teachings, and he has a lot of money left over, but he uses the excuse that he has done what is required according to Islam, so he will not buy non-essential luxuries that he can easily afford for the children, how can we respond to such a father? Especially when it hurts the children’s feelings to see him refusing to buy a simple cake to celebrate the achievement of one of his children, on the grounds that it is non-essential and he is not obliged to provide it?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt is indisputably obligatory for the father to spend on his children. Ibn al-Mundhir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The scholars are agreed that a man must spend on his young children who have no wealth, and they are agreed that if the father dies and leaves behind wealth, the costs of maintenance for the child and the fee for breastfeeding him are to be taken from that wealth. End quote from al-Ijma‘ (98).\nIbn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: All the scholars from whom we acquired knowledge were agreed that the man is obliged to spend on his young children who have no wealth, because a man’s child is part of him, and he is part of his father. Just as he is obliged to spend on himself and his wife, he is also obliged to spend on his children and parents. End quote from al-Mughni (8/212).\nAl-Kasani gave the reason for that, as he said: And because spending when there is a need comes under the heading of maintaining the life of the one on whom that money is spent. The child is part of the father, and it is obligatory for him to maintain his own life and the life of the child who is part of him. Based on what we have mentioned above, each of them is obliged to spend on the other.\nBecause ties of kinship of this kind must be upheld and it is prohibited to sever those ties according to scholarly consensus, and spending on maintenance comes under the heading of upholding these ties, it is obligatory. Not doing that when one is able to do it, and when the one on whom he is obliged to spend is in need, leads to severing those ties of kinship, so it is prohibited.""(Bada’i‘ as-Sana’i‘\xa0 5/2230).\nSecondly:\nThe religious texts did not specify a specific amount for maintenance, because that is something that varies according to people’s circumstances and what they can afford, and according to differences in customs and traditions. Islam refers such matters to local custom (‘urf), so what is obligatory with regard to maintenance for children is what the people in that community regard as essential for the man to spend on the maintenance of his children. That includes fundamentals such as food, drink and clothing, and basic needs, such as transportation, basic education and marriage.\nThis is indicated by the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to Hind: “Take what is sufficient for you and your children on a reasonable basis.” Al-Bukhari (5364).\nThirdly:\nAnything more than the maintenance which is obligatory – when the man can afford it – comes under the heading of kind treatment which Allah, may He be exalted, has enjoined. He has enjoined kindness and generosity to relatives, and the closest of people to a man are his children. Being kind and generous is something additional to doing what is obligatory, which is being just and fair. Allah, may He be exalted, has enjoined justice, and kindness and generosity, and He singled out relatives for mention in the verse (interpretation of the meaning): {Verily, Allah enjoins justice, kindness and giving kinsfolk [their due]} [an-Nahl 16:90]. Justice in the case of maintenance means doing what is obligatory, and kindness means doing more than that, by being generous towards them as much as one can afford.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Kindness is something additional to fairness, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {Verily, Allah enjoins justice, kindness and giving kinsfolk [their due]} [an-Nahl 16:90]. Kindness sometimes means complying with what is required according to Islamic teachings – even if it is obligatory – and sometimes it means doing more than is obligatory.(Tafsir al-‘Uthaymin: al-Fatihah wa’l-Baqarah\xa01/169).\nIbn Sa‘di (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \xa0Allah singled out giving to relatives for mention – even though it is included in the general meaning – so as to emphasize their rights and the importance of upholding ties with them, showing kindness to them and striving in doing that. That includes all relatives, whether they are closely or distantly related, but the more closely they are related, the greater their right to kindness is.""(Tafsir as-Sa‘di\xa0\xa0p. 447).\nThe Quran also mentions them after the command to show kindness to parents, in the verse (interpretation of the meaning): {Be kind to parents [and] relatives} [an-Nisa’ 4:36].\nBased on that, being generous towards one’s children is something that Allah has enjoined, and He has made it a means of attaining His love, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): {for Allah loves those who do good} [Al ‘Imraan 3:134].\nThe religious texts also encourage showing generosity to one’s wife and children.\nAccording to the hadith, the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The best dinar that a man spends is a dinar that he spends on his dependents, and a dinar that a man spends on his mount (for jihad) for the sake of Allah, and a dinar that he spends on his companions (in jihad) for the sake of Allah.” Abu Qilabah said: He started with the dependents. And Abu Qilaabah said: What man is greater in reward than a man who spends on young dependents and protects them from resorting to asking of people – or Allah benefits them through him? Narrated by Muslim (994).\nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said in a marfu‘ report [that is, one that is attributed directly to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)]: “A dinar that you spend for the sake of Allah, a dinar that you spend to free a slave, a dinar that you give in charity to a needy person and a dinar that you spend on your family – the greatest of them in reward is the one that you spend on your family.” Narrated by Muslim (995).\nIt was narrated from ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: “If Allah is generous to you, then be generous.”\nUndoubtedly a father’s being generous to his children and not being stingy with them is one of the most effective ways of reaching their hearts and increasing love between them, because people naturally love the one who shows kindness to them.\nIn this situation, being generous is something to be emphasized when there is an occasion which calls for that, such as one of the children succeeding in exams, or completing the Quran or part of it, or reaching the age of accountability, and so on. These are occasions which require a display of happiness and celebration, and it is important to do that, because the effect on the child cannot be ignored. Hence it is prescribed to offer feasts on numerous occasions, including ‘aqiqah when a child is born, or offering a wedding feast. Some scholars say that it is recommended to celebrate the child’s completing the Quran and so on. This is a beneficial guideline for raising children.\nFourthly:\nThe things referred to in the question are non-essential items, so the father may decide not to provide them by way of raising the children with a simple life and not let them get used to having non-essential luxuries. He may be right or wrong in his decision, but he may be excused and be appreciated for his efforts and the hardship he goes through to provide obligatory maintenance. Thus we may regard his approach as something for which he is to be praised. Many fathers save what is surplus to necessity for the future interests of the children, not to enjoy it themselves. This is something that should be taken into consideration.\nRelationships between family members are not limited to essential and unavoidable rights and duties; rather there should be room for love, compassion, gentleness, kindness, upholding ties of kinship and being easy-going, especially with regard to one’s parents.\nIn most cases, the children will eventually realize that what their father is doing is in their best interests, because parents are usually keener to do that which will benefit their children than the children themselves are. Hence the family must appreciate that and not make it a reason to complain about the father. In the hadith that was narrated from Abu’d-Darda’, it is narrated that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The father is the middle gate of Paradise; if you wish, you may miss that gate or you may maintain it.” Narrated by at-Tirmidhi (1900); classed as sahih by al-Albani in as-Silsilah as-Sahihah (914).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/469532/is-it-obligatory-to-provide-non-essential-luxuries-for-children
34171,I would like to know if Allah will forgive somebody who has done shirk knowingly but wants to change his ways for good forever pls it is very important and another thing how can such a person be forgiven and know that he is forgiven and how can a person increase his iman and do the things that are halal and avoid haram plus be void of psychological problems because I have a lot of them and they bring a lot of confusion and anger and lead me astray thank u pls i am very desperate for guidance from Allah in the form of a person.,"['Praise be to Allah.Is Shirk forgivable?\nAllah has told us that he will forgive all sins for the one who repents to Him. He says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Say: ‘O My slaves! who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allah, verily, Allah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful’” [Az-Zumar 39:53]\nThis includes all sins, even Shirk . Whoever repents, Allah will accept his repentance .\xa0\nHow to repent from Shirk\nWith regard repentance from Shirk in particular and the acceptance thereof, Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And those who invoke not any other god along with Allah, nor kill such person as Allah has forbidden, except for just cause, nor commit illegal sexual intercourse and whoever does this shall receive the punishment. The torment will be doubled to him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein in disgrace; Except those who repent and believe (in Islamic Monotheism), and do righteous deeds; for those, Allah will change their sins into good deeds, and Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” [Al-Furqan 25:68-70]\xa0\nAllah mentions the disbelief and Shirk (associating others with Allah) of the Christians, then calls them to repent. He says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Surely, disbelievers are those who said: “Allah is the third of the three (in a Trinity).” But there is no god (none who has the right to be worshipped) but One God (Allah). And if they cease not from what they say, verily, a painful torment will befall on the disbelievers among them. Will they not turn with repentance to Allah and ask His forgiveness? For Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” [Al-Ma’idah 5:73-74]\xa0\nNo matter how great the sin, the forgiveness, generosity and kindness of Allah is greater.\xa0\nAll you have to do is to turn to Allah , regret what you did and resolve not to do it again. Then receive the glad tidings of the bounty and mercy of Allah, for Islam wipes out whatever sins came before it, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to `Amr ibn Al-`As (may Allah be pleased with him): “O `Amr, do you not know that Islam wipes out whatever came before it.” (Narrated by Muslim, 121 and Ahmad, 17861)\xa0\nAnd the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The one who repents from sin is like one who did not sin.”\xa0 (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, and classed as sound by Al-Albani) \xa0\nIf a person repents to Allah, Allah accepts his repentance and forgives him. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And He it is Who accepts repentance from His slaves, and forgives sins.” [Ash-Shura 42:25]\xa0\n“And verily, I am indeed forgiving to him who repents, believes (in My Oneness, and associates none in worship with Me) and does righteous good deeds, and then remains constant in doing them (till his death.)” [Ta-Ha 20:82]\xa0\nWe have to think well of our Lord and hope that He will accept our repentance, for Allah says, “I am as My slave thinks I am.” (A Qudsi Hadith narrated by Al-Bukhari, 7066 and Muslim, 2675) According to Ahmad with an authentic chain of narrators:\xa0 “I am as My slave thinks I am, so let him think whatever he wants.”\xa0\nHow to strengthen faith\nWith regard to strengthening your faith , this may be done in many ways, such as the following:\xa0\n\nRemembering Allah a great deal, reading His Book and sending a great deal of blessings upon His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).\xa0\nRegularly offering the obligatory prayers on time and offering a lot of optional prayers, so that one may attain the love and support of Allah as it says in the Hadith: “Whosoever shows enmity to someone devoted to Me, I shall be at war with him. My servant draws not near to Me with anything more loved by Me than the religious duties I have enjoined upon him, and My servant continues to draw near to Me with supererogatory works so that I shall love him. When I love him I am his hearing with which he hears, his seeing with which he sees, his hand with which he strikes and his foot with which he walks. Were he to ask [something] of Me, I would surely give it to him, and were he to ask Me for refuge, I would surely grant him it.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 6137)\xa0\nKeeping company with good people who will help you to worship and obey Allah and discourage you from disobeying Him. \xa0\nReading biographies of righteous people among the scholars, ascetics (Zahids), devoted worshippers and those who repented.\xa0\nKeeping away from everything that reminds you of sin and calls you to it.\xa0\n\nIn general, faith is increased by doing acts of worship and keeping away from prohibited things.\xa0\nWe ask Allah to help you and to accept your repentance, and to guide your heart.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34171/is-shirk-forgivable
