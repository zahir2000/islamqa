When I clicked on it, it said that I had to pay $500 [to open an account], and they would add $150 to my account as a kind of initial support, and they would start to extract diamonds and sell them every four days. They would get in touch with me and ask me if I wanted to buy a particular diamond, and after four days they would sell it and I would receive the profit, and the bank would take 4% of the profit. Is it permissible to work with them?","['Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to work with what you have mentioned, because what the bank adds to your account, which is $150, is regarded as a loan, in return for your being a partner with them, and their acting as your broker in selling after that. It is not permissible to combine a loan and a business transaction according to the majority of jurists, because that is a loan which brings a benefit to the lender, and that is riba (usury).\nIn the hadith of ‘Amr ibn Shu‘ayb from his father, from his grandfather, it says: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “It is not permissible to arrange a loan combined with a sale.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (1234), Abu Dawud (3504) and al-Nasa’i (4611); classed as sahih by al-Tirmidhi and al-Albani.\nBased on this hadith, the jurists determine that it is haram to combine a loan with a business transaction.\nIt says in a statement of the Islamic Fiqh Council, explaining the prohibition on dealing in margins: Secondly, if the middleman stipulates that the customer should do business through him, this leads to combining a loan and a business transaction (brokerage), and this comes under the heading of combining a loan and a sale, which is prohibited according to Islamic teachings in the hadith of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “It is not permissible to arrange a loan combined with a sale.” Narrated by Abu Dawud (3/384) and by al-Tirmidhi (3/526), who said: It is a hasan sahih hadith. Thus he will have benefitted from his loan, and the jurists are unanimously agreed that every loan that brings a benefit is riba, which is forbidden.\nEnd quote from Majallat al-Majma‘ al-Fiqh al-Islami, issue no. 22, p. 229.\nFor the full text of the statement, please see the answer to question no. 106094 .\nIf we assume for the sake of argument that what the bank said is genuine, and is not a trick or scam, it is very unlikely that someone could become a partner in buying raw materials and preparing them, then selling them, and only take 4% of the profits!\nThat applies if he is contributing his labour only, which is unlikely, so how about if he also contributes money and gives you a sum equal to one third of your money to be added to your account!\nYou must beware of dealing with these organisations whose work cannot be seen and it is impossible to watch how they operate. What you have mentioned of the transaction is sufficient to deem it haram, as noted above.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/286976/ruling-on-investing-money-in-the-international-diamond-bank
88206,"I know that it is essential to say the name of Allah when slaughtering animals that are to be eaten, and that it is not permissible to eat from that over which the name of Allah has not been mentioned, but sometimes a Muslim has to travel to a non-Muslim country and stay there for several years, for work or study. Should he refrain from eating meat completely for this length of time or in this case is he regarded as compelled by necessity to eat meat or is it sufficient to say the name of Allah at the time of eating?","['Praise be to Allah.Saying Bismillah when slaughtering meat\xa0\nSaying the name of Allah is a condition of meat being permissible, and it is not excused by forgetting or not knowing, according to the most correct scholarly opinion.\xa0\nConditions of eating meat slaughtered by Christians and Jews\nMeat slaughtered by one of the people of the Book (a Jew or a Christian) is permissible subject to two conditions:\xa0\n\nThat the meat is slaughtered as a Muslim does it, by cutting the throat and oesophagus and letting the blood flow. If the animal is killed by strangling or electric shock or drowning in water, its meat is not permissible. Similarly, if a Muslim does that, the meat is not permissible.\xa0\nNo name other than that of Allah should be mentioned over it, such as the name of the Messiah etc, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n\n“Eat not (O believers) of that (meat) on which Allah’s Name has not been pronounced (at the time of the slaughtering of the animal).” [Al-An`am 6:121]\nAnd He says concerning prohibited things (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“He has forbidden you only the Maytah (dead animals), and blood, and the flesh of swine, and that which is slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than Allah (or has been slaughtered for idols, on which Allah’s Name has not been mentioned while slaughtering).” [Al-Baqarah 2:173]\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \xa0\n“What is meant here is that over which a name other than that of Allah is mentioned at the time of slaughter, such as saying “in the name of the Messiah” or “in the name of Muhammad” or “in the name of Jibril” or “in the name of Al-Lat” and so on.” (Tafsir Surat Al-Baqarah)\xa0\nThe prohibition also applies to that which is offered as a sacrifice to the Messiah or to Az-Zahrah, even if they did not mention a name other than that of Allah over it. It is also prohibited.\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\xa0\n“As for that which is slaughtered by the people of the Book for their festivals and as an act of worship to draw closer to someone other than Allah, as the Muslims offer their sacrifices to draw closer to Allah thereby, such as what they slaughter for the Messiah and Az-Zahrah, there are two reports narrated from Ahmad concerning that, the most well known of which in his texts is that it is not permissible to eat it, even if the name of someone other than Allah has not been mentioned over it. The prohibition on doing that was narrated from `Aishah and `Abdullah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with them).” (Iqtida’ Al-Sirat Al-Mustaqim, 1/251)\xa0\nCan Muslims eat meat if they don’t know whether the name of Allah was mentioned over it or not?\nIf a Muslim or a person from the people of the Book slaughters an animal for meat, and it is not known whether he mentioned the name of Allah over it or not, it is permissible to eat from it, and the one who eats it should say the name of Allah, because of the report that was narrated by Al-Bukhari (2057) from `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her), that some people said: O Messenger of Allah, some people bring meat to us, and we do not know whether they mentioned the name of Allah over it or not. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Mention the name of Allah over it and eat.”\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“It is not essential to ask about what was slaughtered by a Muslim or a person from the people of the Book, and how it was slaughtered, and whether the name of Allah was mentioned over it or not. Rather that should not be done, because that is being obstinate in religious matters. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) ate meat slaughtered by the Jews and did not ask questions.\nIn Al-Bukhari and elsewhere it is narrated from `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that some people said to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): Some people bring meat to us, and we do not know whether they mentioned the name of Allah over it or not. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Mention the name of Allah over it and eat.” She said: They were new in Islam, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told them to eat without asking, even though those who brought the meat to them may not have been aware of the rulings of Islam because they were new in Islam.” (Risalah fi Ahkam Al-Udhiyah wal-Dhakah by Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him))\nCan Muslims living in non-Muslim countries eat meat?\nBased on the above, whoever travels to a non-Muslim country where most of those who slaughter meat are Christians or Jews, it is permissible for him to eat their meat, unless he knows that they stun the animals or mention over them the name of someone other than Allah, as stated above.\xa0\nBut if the slaughterman is an idol-worshipper or communist, it is not permissible to eat meat slaughtered by him.\xa0\nIf the meat is prohibited , it is not permissible to eat from it on the grounds of necessity, so long as a person can find food to keep him alive, such as fish, vegetables and so on.\xa0\nShaykh `Abd Ar-Rahman Al-Barrak (may Allah preserve him) said:\xa0\n“The meat available in non-Muslim countries is of various types. As for fish, it is permissible in all cases, because its permissibility does not depend on the way in which it is slaughtered or on the name of Allah being mentioned over it.\nWith regard to other types of meat, if the companies or individuals who produce meat are from the People of the Book, Jews or Christians, and it is not known from them that they kill the animal by electric shock, strangling or striking it on the head, as is well known in the west, then this meat is permissible. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Made lawful to you this day are At-Tayyibat [all kinds of lawful foods, which Allah has made lawful (meat of slaughtered eatable animals, milk products, fats, vegetables and fruits)]. The food (slaughtered cattle, eatable animals) of the people of the Book (Jews and Christians) is lawful to you and yours is lawful to them.” [Al-Ma’idah 5:5]\xa0\nHowever, if they kill the animal by one of the methods mentioned, then the meat is prohibited, because in that case it is meat that has been strangled or killed by a blow. If those who produce the meat are not Jews or Christians, then the meat that they offer is prohibited. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Eat not (O believers) of that (meat) on which Allah’s Name has not been pronounced (at the time of the slaughtering of the animal), for sure it is Fisq (a sin and disobedience of Allah).” [Al-An`am 6:121]\nThe Muslim should strive to avoid that which is clearly prohibited and be cautious of doubtful matters so as to preserve his religious commitment and to keep his body safe from being nourished with haram things.”\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/88206/conditions-of-eating-meat-slaughtered-by-jews-and-christians
269007,"I found someone who had a wheelchair for rent or purchase in the street next to the Haram in Makkah, and I bought the wheelchair from him for approximately 200 riyals. There was a policeman nearby, and when I asked him about the price of wheelchairs in the shops, I found out that they are sold for no less than approximately 600 riyals. And I used the wheelchair. Please note that there was no writing on the wheelchair to indicate that it was for charity. I hope that you can advise me as to whether that was a valid transaction, especially since my mother used it when doing the rituals of ‘umrah.","['Praise be to Allah.The cheapness of an item does not necessarily indicate that it is stolen goods. It may be fake, or the owner may be rich and no longer needs it, and he does not want to keep it as he no longer has any use for it, so he sells it cheaply, or he asks for a price lower than its real value because he wants to benefit visitors to the House of Allah, or there may be other reasons.\nIf the individual knows that the item is stolen, it is not permissible for him to buy it, because that comes under the heading of consuming people’s wealth unlawfully, and is also cooperating in sin and transgression. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And cooperate in righteousness and piety, but do not cooperate in sin and transgression. And fear Allah; indeed, Allah is severe in penalty}\xa0[al-Ma’idah 5:2].\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about buying stolen goods, and he replied:\nWhat appears to be the case, based on shar‘i evidence, is that it is not permissible for you to buy it, if it is clear to you or you think it most likely that it was stolen, because Allah, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning): {but do not cooperate in sin and transgression} [al-Ma’idah 5:2].\nAnd because you know or think it most likely that the seller is not the rightful owner of the item, and it is not permitted, according to Islamic teachings, to sell it. So how can you help him in his wrongdoing, and take the property of someone else unlawfully?""(Fatawa Ibn Baz\xa0 19/92).\nShaykh al-Albani was asked:\nIs it permissible to buy an item that was possibly stolen for a price that is cheaper than the usual price?\nShaykh: The possibility of its having been stolen may vary, and rulings cannot be based on speculation and delusion. If the possibility is based on what is most likely to be the case, then it is not permissible to buy this item. Most shar‘i rulings are based on what the accountable person thinks is most likely to be the case. As for a mere passing thought, it is not permissible to go along with that thought and accept it, for that will lead to intrusive thoughts and illusions. End quote.\nBut if there is no sound likelihood of that, then the individual is not obliged to check and try to find out who the real owner of what is being offered for sale is. The basic principle is that items that being offered for sale belong to the one in whose hands they are.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/269007/he-found-an-item-being-sold-for-a-cheap-price-and-thinks-that-it-is-stolen-goods-can-he-buy-it
20872,"My parents treated me very badly, to such an extent that I lost my self-confidence and became hesitant and fearful. I couldn’t do anything right and I did not know how to make a decision. I got married and Allah has blessed me with a daughter. I want to avoid what happened to me so that this regrettable experience is not repeated with my daughter. What do you advise me to do?","['Praise be to Allah.When do daughters form their attitudes towards the world?\nAt the age of two, a child starts to form her attitude towards the world around her. Some developmental psychologists think that the sense of self-confidence is one of the first of these attitudes and the strength of these feelings at age 2 depends on the kind of care that the child receives and on the parents’ attitude in meeting her basic needs.\xa0\nAt this stage, the child shows signs of development by showing a desire for independence, as she needs the freedom to speak, walk and play. All of that is connected to the need to assert herself which can only be achieved by allowing her a measure of independence.\xa0\nThis is confirmed by the theory of development through maturity which says that we should respect the child’s individuality and leave him or her to develop naturally.\xa0\nReasons for lack of self-confidence\nSome girls grow up lacking self-confidence such that they cannot rely upon themselves in any matter, major or minor. They rarely take any initiative and are always waiting for someone to say, “Do such and such.”\nIf faced with a problem, such a girl will be unable to take any decision and may try to avoid confronting the problem, or start crying. This is partly the parents’ fault, and it may be for a number of reasons, such as:\n\nToo much control (“Do this, don’t do that”) in major and minor matters alike, even if the matter does not warrant it, so that the child loses her spontaneity and this makes her lose confidence in her actions, and instead she always waits for someone to correct her and reassure her that she is doing the right thing.\nBlaming and criticizing her for everything she does, exposing her faults and rebuking her if she makes a mistake, so that she is blamed and rebuked more than she deserves at the time when she is expecting praise for her efforts. This destroys the child’s motivation to act or to compete in doing anything and doing it well.\nNot giving the child the opportunity to speak in front of others for fear that she may make a mistake or speak of things that are not desirable, or else allowing her to speak but telling her what she should say.\nGiving her too many warnings about danger, which will make her always expect the worst and imagine that she is surrounded by danger on all sides.\nPutting her down or comparing her to others, which makes her think that she has no worth.\nMaking fun of her and mocking her.\nNot paying attention to her questions.\nPaying too much attention in a manner that shows excessive worry about her health or her future.\n\nNegative effects of lack of self-confidence\nLack of self-confidence has many negative effects on the child, such as:\n\nShe will not be able to do anything independently, and if she is asked to bring something and finds that it differs from the description given, she will be hesitant; if she is faced with a problem she will be unable to make a decision.\nShe will become dull-witted and not creative.\nShe will start to complain and feel unhappy whenever anything is asked of her, because she thinks that she will be blamed for whatever she does and that she will not be able to do it in the manner required.\nShe will become weak-willed and will have no resolve, and she will feel meek and apathetic in situations where such attitudes are not appropriate, and will become neglectful and disorganized.\nShe will suffer anxiety and frustration, and will develop a hostile attitude or a tendency to become introverted and withdrawn.\n\nHow parents boost daughter’s self-confidence\nIn order to avoid these negative effects on the child, parents should use a number of ways to develop the child’s self-confidence. Some examples follow, but this is not a complete list:\n\nThey should draw up some general guidelines to follow by telling her what Allah has made permissible, which she may do, and what He has forbidden, which she must avoid. They should make her aware of noble attributes and good manners, and instill in her a dislike for bad manners, deeds and words, and the need to steer clear of trivial matters. Then after that they should give her the freedom to act on her own initiative.\nThe mother should assign her some tasks that she is able to do. If she makes a mistake, the mother should praise her for her initiative and encourage her, then tell her what she should have done. Sometimes she should just praise her for her efforts, then complete the work in a gentle manner, without telling her directly. If the task is not something that the child is able to do, then the mother may do it and consult the child and ask for her opinion, and let the child state what she thinks is good and is not, so that the child will realize that everyone is vulnerable to making mistakes but also gets things right sometimes. This will strengthen her resolve.\nThe parents should try to praise the child in front of her relatives and friends, and give her rewards commensurate with her efforts. They should praise her for the acts of worship that she does, such as praying regularly, memorizing Quran, doing well in her studies, having a good attitude, and so on.\nThey should give her a nickname that will distinguish her from others, but they should not allow anyone to call her by a bad nickname. If she makes them angry they should call her by her real name, so that she will realize that she has fallen short in her duty to one or both of them, or that she has wronged somebody, so that she will realize that.\nStrengthening her will-power, by getting her used to two things, namely:\n\n\nKeeping secrets: when she knows how to keep secrets and not divulge them, then her will-power will develop and grow stronger, and thus her self-confidence will increase.\nGetting her used to fasting, for when she stands firm in the face of hunger and thirst when fasting, she will feel the joy of achieving victory over her Nafs (self), which will strengthen her will-power when facing life, and in turn, this will increase her self-confidence.\n\n\nStrengthening her confidence in dealing with other people. This may be done by getting her to do housework, obeying the parents’ commands, and letting her sit with the adults and get together with other youngsters.\nStrengthening her confidence in gaining knowledge, by teaching her the Quran and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and his biography, so that she will grow up having acquired abundant knowledge in childhood, and thus develop a sense of confidence in the knowledge that she has, because she will have gained the basic principles of true knowledge, far removed from myths and legends.\n\nWhat causes a child to feel inadequate?\nParents must take some precautions and take effective measures to save the child from feeling inadequate. Some of the things that cause a child to feel inadequate are: belittling her, humiliating her and mocking her, such as calling her by offensive names and words in front of her siblings and relatives, or even in front of her friends or in front of strangers whom she has never met before.\xa0\nThese are matters which may make her regard herself as insignificant and worthless, or may generate psychological complexes that will make her look at others with hatred and dislike, and make her withdraw into herself in order to escape from life.\nEven if the offensive words that slip from the parents’ tongues are only for the purpose of disciplining the child for some mistake, great or small, it is not right to use this method to correct her, as this will have a bad effect on the child’s psyche and personal conduct, and it will make her accustomed to the language of condemnation and insult that will destroy her psychologically and morally.\nThe best way of dealing with this problem is to explain to the child, in a gentle manner, where she has gone wrong and to give her proof that will convince her to avoid the mistake in future; the parents should not scold her, and certainly not in front of others. The parents should use good methods in correcting her from the outset, following the example of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in the way he reformed and trained people and corrected their mistakes. For the child is very sensitive and readily influenced, irrational and helpless. Building the child’s self-confidence is the first step in building her personality through all stages of life.\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 215167 , 88153 , 162787 , 10016 , 217409 , and 224758 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20872/how-to-boost-your-daughters-self-confidence-in-islam
