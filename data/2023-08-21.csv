242079,"Praise be to Allah, I am a religiously committed young man living in a European country. My father does not pray, and he gambles, meaning that he bets on horses. One day he won a prize from betting, and he told me that he was going to buy me a car and a house with this money. But I told him that all that I want is for him to be safe. Now I do not know what to do; should I accept it from him or not?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nWe ask Allah, may He be exalted, to make you steadfast in adhering to righteousness, and to guide your father, and to grant you the joy of seeing him mend his ways, and to enable you to honour and obey him.\nUndoubtedly your father is in grave danger and is being tested with a great trial. The right that the one who is tested has over us is that we should show kindness to him and be compassionate regarding his situation and pity him, and we should be gentle in calling him, in order to bring him out of the situation he is in. The first thing you should do in calling and guiding him is pay attention to the matter of prayer, even if you do that gradually and gently. Perhaps Allah will guide him and open his heart to establishing prayer and obeying the Lord of the Worlds.\nSecondly:\nUndoubtedly the most prudent and appropriate thing for you to do is refuse to accept this money, because the money itself that you would be accepting was acquired in an unlawful manner. As there is a strong difference of opinion among the scholars as to whether it is permissible to accept such a gift, then being cautious and not accepting such a gift is more appropriate, and that will be of greater help to you in explaining to your father the ruling on it and the prohibition on acquiring it. Perhaps Allah will guide him because of what he sees of his son’s restraint and refusal to benefit from it.\nHowever, if you need that money and it is too difficult for you to do without it, or if not accepting it would result in estrangement between you and your father, or it would result in a bad relationship between you, then we hope that there will be no blame on you for accepting it from him, even if he did acquire it in an unlawful manner, because in the case of wealth that is haram because of the manner in which it was acquired – such as wealth acquired by dealing in riba, gambling or accepting bribes – it is permissible for someone other than the one who acquired it, if he obtains it in a permissible manner, such as a gift or what is spent on his maintenance. This has been stated by more than one of the scholars, and we have given answers on that basis on this website.\nFor more information, please see the answers to questions no. 171922 , 126486 , 215 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/242079/should-he-accept-the-money-from-his-father-even-though-he-obtained-it-by-gambling
427571,"The Best and complete ablution performing with many Hadiths with different narrator are mention in the shahieeen but While doing ablution,Wiping on the ear is not mention in the whole bokhari, Muslim. I know it's mention in some one Hadith of tarmizi and nasahi but here question is arise that All the compenions and the narrator of shahieeen not reporting this so this issue is seem like the issue of yafa yadaan. now can we say either it's not Authantic or this is not used often by the prophet (optional) in ablution?","['Praise be to Allah.The fact that al-Bukhari and Muslim did not narrate a particular hadith does not indicate that it is da‘if (weak), because they did not claim that they had collected all the sahih (sound) hadiths, as is affirmed in the books of hadith sciences.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThey (al-Bukhari and Muslim) did not commit themselves to collecting all the sahih reports; rather it is soundly narrated from them that they clearly stated that they did not collect all of them. Rather all they wanted to do was to collect some of the sahih hadiths in their books, similar to the aim of the author of a book of jurisprudence, who wants to discuss some issues of jurisprudence in his book, not to cover all the issues thereof.""(Sharh Sahih Muslim\xa0 1/42).\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nMoreover, al-Bukhari and Muslim did not commit themselves to narrating in their books all the hadiths that are deemed to be sahih. They classed as sahih some hadiths that are not included in their books, and at-Tirmidhi and others narrated from al-Bukhari some hadiths that are not in his book; rather they are in as-Sunan and elsewhere.""(Ikhtisar ‘Ulum al-Hadith\xa0p. 25).\nFurthermore, if they omitted a hadith because they believe that it was da‘if, that does not indicate that there was consensus that it was da‘if. Perhaps they classed it as da‘if whilst other leading scholars classed it as sahih.\nBased on that, the fact that wiping the ears is not mentioned in the hadiths of as-Sahihayn does not mean that it is not prescribed to do that at all. That has been proven by at-Tirmidhi, an-Nasa’i and others, and more than one of the scholars has narrated that there is scholarly consensus that it is prescribed.\nIt was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) wiped his head and his ears, inside and out.\nNarrated by an-Nasa’i (102) and at-Tirmidhi (36), who said: Concerning this issue there is a report narrated from ar-Rubayyi‘,. And the report of Ibn ‘Abbaas is a hasan sahih hadith. End quote.\nIbn ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe Muslims are all agreed that taking water into the nose and blowing it out is part of wudu’, and the same applies to rinsing out the mouth and wiping the ears.\nHowever they differed regarding the one who omits that by mistake or deliberately.""(At-Tamhid\xa0 18/225).\nIbn Hubayrah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThey were unanimously agreed that wiping the inside and outside of the ears is one of the Sunnahs of wudu’, except for Ahmad, who regarded wiping them as obligatory, according to what Harb narrated from him. He was asked about that and he said: He should repeat his prayer if he omits it.""(Ikhtilaf al-‘A’immah al-‘Ulama’\xa0 1/44).\nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 115246 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/427571/it-is-prescribed-to-wipe-the-ears-when-doing-wudu
