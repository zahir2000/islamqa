275057,"I was praying, and when I wanted to say the salaam, I intended to say the salaam to the angels, but I did not bring to mind the intention to exit the prayer. A few seconds after finishing the two taslims, I became uncertain about what I was doing, and I repeated the two taslims, then I did the prostration of forgetfulness. Is what I did correct?","['Praise be to Allah.The basic principle is that the worshipper intends by saying the taslim at the end of the prayer to exit the prayer, just as he intends to start the prayer when he says the takbir at the beginning.\nIt was narrated from ‘Ali, from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), that he said: “The key to prayer is purification, it begins with the takbir and ends with the taslim.” Narrated by Abu Dawud (61) and by at-Tirmidhi (3), who said: This hadith is the soundest and best thing that has been narrated regarding this matter. It was also classed as sahih by al-Albani in Irwa’ al-Ghalil (2/8).\nIbn Rushd (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe taslim to exit the prayer is like the takbir to start it in all circumstances, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) mentioned them together, as he said:\xa0 “The prayer begins with the takbir and ends with the taslim.”\nJust as he cannot begin the prayer except by saying the takbir with the intention of beginning the prayer, similarly he cannot exit the prayer except by saying the taslim with the intention of exiting from the prayer.""(Al-Muqaddimat al-Mumahhidat\xa0 1/175).\nBut if the worshipper forgets the intention when saying the taslim, then the most correct view among the views of the jurists is that his prayer is valid, because the intention at the beginning of the prayer includes all of the actions and words thereof.\nPlease see the answer to question no. 175471 .\nMoreover, your bringing to mind the intention to greet the angels with salaam was similar to bringing to mind the intention to finish the prayer and exit from it, because greeting the angels with salaam in the prayer is only done when exiting the prayer. But the worshipper may sometimes focus on one idea more than the other, so it seems to him that he has neglected one of them, but in fact he has brought both ideas to mind.\nThe basic principle regarding the thoughts that crossed your mind after you said the taslim is that they are mere doubts, and doubts after completing the prayer are to be ignored and do not matter.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nHaving doubts after completing an act of worship does not matter, whether you are have doubts about the intention (niyyah) or about some parts of the act of worship. That does not matter unless you are certain.""(Ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘\xa0 1/206).\nTo sum up, your prayer is valid, and these thoughts that crossed your mind do not matter. Even if you are certain that you did not form the intention to exit the prayer, your prayer is still valid according to the more correct view of the jurists.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/275057/he-thinks-that-he-did-not-call-to-mind-the-intention-to-exit-the-prayer-when-saying-the-salaam-is-his-prayer-valid
417534,"If a brother sees his sisters doing something wrong, and he keeps quiet because he is afraid, then he tells his father after some time, and there are consequences of his having kept quiet for a while, is he sinning? Is he responsible for that?","['Praise be to Allah.The one whose sees something wrong and is able to act or speak against it must do so, unless he fears that doing so will lead to a greater evil.\nMuslim (49) narrated that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever among you sees an evil action, let him change it with his hand (by taking action); if he cannot, then with his tongue (by speaking out); and if he cannot, then with his heart (by hating it and feeling it is wrong), and that is the weakest of faith.”\nIbn al-Qayyim said:\nDenouncing evil is of four levels:\n1. When it is removed and replaced with its opposite [its opposite is what is right and good].\n2. When it is reduced, even if it is not completely removed.\n3. When it is replaced with something that is equally bad.\n4. When it is replaced with something that is worse than it.\nThe first two levels are acceptable, the third is subject to ijtihad, and the fourth is haram.""(I‘lam al-Muwaqqi‘in\xa03/12-13).\nYou should understand that it is very important for the brother to object to what his sisters are doing, because they are his honour and he is enjoined to protect them. If he fears that denouncing their wrong actions will lead to negative consequences, he should tell his father or mother.\nAs to whether he is sinning by not denouncing their actions, if he fails to denounce their wrong actions or tell his parents when he is not expecting a greater evil to result from that, then he is sinning. If he fears a greater evil may result from denouncing their actions on telling his father, and he puts a stop to the evil action and tries to prevent any repeat of it, then he is excused, in sha Allah.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/417534/if-a-brother-sees-his-sisters-doing-something-wrong-and-keeps-quiet-then-there-are-consequences-is-he-sinning
13966,"If a woman’s husband dies, she remains in ‘iddah (a waiting period) whilst mourning. What are the things that a woman should not do during the mourning period?","['Praise be to Allah.Forbidden practices for a mourning woman :\xa0\n\nGo out of the house : she is only allowed to do so for a necessity, such as if she is sick and needs to go to the hospital, in which case she should go during the day; or in the case of emergencies such as if her house is about to fall down and she fears that it may collapse on top of her; or in the case of fire; and so on.\xa0\n\nThe scholars said: “She may go out during the day for necessary purposes, but at night she should not go out unless it is essential.”\xa0\n\nWear perfume: the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade the  mourning woman from wearing perfume except when she purifies herself following her period, in which case she may apply a little Azfar (a kind of perfume) after her period ends, to remove the traces of menstruation odour\nWear beautiful clothes : the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade the woman from wearing clothes that are considered to be adornments while mourning. Rather she should wear ordinary clothes such as the kind that she usually wears inside her house, without making herself look beautiful\nApply kohl: the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade that. If she needs to use it, she should use the kind of kohl whose colour is not obvious, applying it at night and removing it during the day\xa0\nWear jewellery : if a woman is forbidden from wearing beautiful clothes while mourning, it is more appropriate that jewellery should not be allowed.\xa0\n\nPermissible practices for a mourning woman:\nIt is permissible for a widow in mourning to:\n\nSpeak to men\xa0\nSpeak on the telephone\nAllow people to enter the house who are permitted to do so according to Shari`ah\nGo onto the roof of her house during the night and during the day.\xa0\n\nPractices women are not compelled to do during mourning:\nThere are some practices that women commonly do while mourning which they are not compelled to do, such as:\n\nPerform ghusl every week as some of the common folk think\nUndo their hair every week\nA widow in mourning does not have to – indeed it is not prescribed for her to – go out when her `iddah (waiting period) ends and give charity to the first person she meets. This is an act of bid`ah (religious innovation).\xa0\n\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13966/prohibited-practices-for-a-mourning-woman
