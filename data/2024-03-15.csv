366204,"I want to inquire about menstruation. I felt pain about twenty minutes before Maghrib, so I went to check, but nothing had come out, so I completed my fasting. When I went to perform Wudu’ for the Maghrib prayer, I felt very severe pain, so I purified myself as best as I could, then went out to pray and performed the prayer. During my prayer, the pain lessened, and usually, when the pain subsides, it means that menstruation has started, but I did not cut off my prayer and completed it because I did not feel the menstruation coming. I completed the prayer, and when I finished, I entered the bathroom and wiped to check, and there was menstrual blood as if it had just come out. My question is, should I repeat the Maghrib prayer? And should I repeat the fasting for that day or not?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nYour fasting for this day is valid because you did not see the blood nor feel its discharge before Maghrib, and the principle is that if there is doubt about the timing of the blood discharge, whether it was before or after Maghrib, it is is attributed to the nearest time, and this is one of the principles of Jurisprudence. The nearest time here is after Maghrib.\nThe meaning of the principle is: ""When there is a difference in the timing of an event\'s occurrence, and there is no evidence to determine it - then this event is attributed to the closest time to the current situation; because that is certain, and the further time is doubtful. However, if its attribution to the further time is established, then it must be acted upon."" End quote from ""Encyclopedia of Jurisprudential Principles"" by Dr. Muhammad Sidqi Al-Borno (12/316).\nAs-Suyuti (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his book ""Al-Ashbah wan-Nadha\'ir"" page 59: ""Principle: The origin of every event is to estimate it by the nearest time. Among its branches: If he sees semen on his garment and does not remember having a wet dream, the correct opinion is that he must perform Ghusl. Ash-Shafi`i said in Al-Umm: \'And he must repeat every Salah he has performed since the last time he slept.\'"" End quote.\nSecondly:\nAs for the Maghrib prayer, if you think it most likely that the blood was discharged during it due to the light pain—as you mentioned—and because you saw the blood fresh after the prayer, and the like, which indicates a most likely opinion, then the prayer is not valid, and you must repeat it once you become pure.\nIf there is no feeling of likelihood, but rather doubt, then the prayer is valid; because of what we have previously mentioned that the event is attributed to the nearest time, and it is judged that the blood was discharged after the prayer.\nSheikh Muhammad ibn Muhammad Al-Mukhtar Ash-Shanqiti (may Allah preserve him) was asked about a woman who saw some menstrual blood after the Maghrib prayer and did not know whether it was discharged before sunset or after; what is the ruling regarding her prayer and fasting?\nHe replied: ""If she saw the blood and thinks it most likely that it was discharged before sunset, then there is no doubt that the fast of that day is void and she must make it up.\nBut if she thinks it most likely that the blood is fresh and that it was discharged after Maghrib, then there is no doubt about the validity of her fast, and the Maghrib prayer is obligatory when she becomes pure; for she must make it up and perform it.\nBut if she is hesitant and doubtful, then the principle among the scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) says: (It is attributed to the nearest event), so the original ruling is the validity of the fast until evidence indicates its invalidity, and the original ruling is that she fasted a complete day, and she is free of liability until we ascertain the existence of this factor, so her fast is judged to be valid.\nAs for the blood, it has no effect on that day, and the issue remains the opposite, because if you say: her fast is valid, she is obliged to make up Maghrib, and if you say: her fast is not valid, there is no making up of Maghrib, for if she is exempted from fasting, she is obliged to make up Maghrib; because the entry of the time renders the menstruating woman liable, and it is not considered at the end of the time as the Hanafi Jurists and some of the companions of Imam Ahmad say.""

20236,I would like to know if performing the washing (that is performed before prayer and reading the Quran not ghsul) is necessary before performing tawbah (confessing and being sorry for your sins). And also if ghsul is necessary before tawbah in the case that someone is unclean.,"['Praise be to Allah.Every son of Adam commits sin\nThere is no human being who does not commit sin, and the best of them are those who hasten to repent. It was narrated from Anas that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Every son of Adam commits sin and the best of those who commit sin are those who repent.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 2499; Ibn Majah, 4251; classed as good by Al-Albani in Sahih Al-Jami`, 3428.\xa0\nAllah has enjoined repentance upon His slaves\nAllah has enjoined repentance upon His slaves , as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“O you who believe! Turn to Allah with sincere repentance! It may be that your Lord will expiate from you your sins, and admit you into Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise)”\xa0[At-Tahrim 66:8]\nWill Allah accept your repentance?\nAnd Allah has told us that He accepts the repentance of His slaves and forgives them; indeed He turns their bad deeds into good deeds. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And He it is Who accepts repentance from His slaves, and forgives sins, and He knows what you do.”\xa0[Ash-Shura 42:25]\xa0\n“Except those who repent and believe (in Islamic Monotheism), and do righteous deeds; for those, Allah will change their sins into good deeds, and Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.”\xa0[Al-Furqan 25:70]\nCan you repent without Wudu or Ghusl?\nAllah has not commanded the person who repents to do Wudu or Ghusl, whether his impurity is minor or major, either before or after repenting, unless he is repenting from disbelief or apostasy.\xa0\nThe scholars of the Standing Committee said:\xa0\n“Ghusl is not required after sincere repentance from sin, because the basic principle is that it is not prescribed, and we do not know of any evidence that differs from this principle except if the person is repenting from disbelief, because it is prescribed for the one who enters Islam to do Ghusl, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded Qays ibn `Asim to do that when he became Muslim.

These conditions are as follows:\xa0\n\nSincerity in repentance .\nGiving up the sin.\nRegretting the sin.\nResolving not to go back to the sin.\nRepenting at the time when repentance is accepted, for Allah does not accept repentance once the death rattle reaches the throat when the soul is being taken, or after the sun rises from the west.\nRestoring rights to people if the sin had to do with transgressions against the rights of other people.\n\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20236/can-you-repent-without-wudu-or-ghusl

11798,"I know when getting married a person needs their parents blessing and consent but what if married couples are separated and are considering returning to each other, do they still need their parents blessing all over again?","['Praise be to Allah.If a man divorces his wife and this is the first or second pronouncement of divorce and she has not ended her `iddah (by giving birth if she is pregnant or by the passage of three menstrual cycles if she is not pregnant), then he can take his wife back by saying, “I am taking you back” or “I am keeping you.” Then his taking her back is valid. Or he may do some action intending thereby to take her back, such as having intercourse with the intention of taking her back.\xa0\nThe Sunnah is to have two witnesses to the fact that he has taken her back , so that two witnesses testify to that, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Then when they are about to attain their term appointed, either take them back in a good manner or part with them in a good manner. And take as witness two just persons from among you (Muslims).” [At-Talaq 65:2]\nIn this manner a man may take his wife back.\xa0\nBut if the `Iddah has ended following a first or second pronouncement of divorce, then there has to be a new marriage contract. In this case, he has to propose marriage like any other man, to her guardian and to her.\xa0\nWhen she and her guardian agree and they agree upon a Mahr, then the marriage contract is completed. That must be done in the presence of two just witnesses.\xa0\nBut if the divorce is the final – i.e., third – divorce, then she becomes prohibited for him until another man has married her , because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And if he has divorced her (the third time), then she is not lawful unto him thereafter until she has married another husband.” [Al-Baqarah 2:230]\nSo it is not permissible for him to marry her unless she has been married to another man and the marriage has been consummated, then he leaves her either through death or divorce. This marriage must be a legitimate Shar`i marriage; if she marries him just to make it permissible for her to go back to her first husband, that is not permitted and she does not become permissible (to the first husband).\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11798/how-to-take-back-your-wife-after-divorce
6533,My question is that: how soon after having sex should a bath be taken? We have heard that everything you do before having a bath like walking or cooking is haram. Is it OK to take a bath before your next prayer?,"['Praise be to Allah.Should we bathe immediately after sex?\nThere is no set time limit within which a woman who is in a state of major ritual impurity has to do Ghusl . It has to do with the performance of prayers and other acts of worship where purity is required.\xa0\nCan you delay Ghusl until the time for the next prayer?\nThere is no harm in delaying Ghusl until the time for the next prayer comes, so long as the prayer before it has been performed in a state of purity. But it is recommended for the Muslim to hasten to do Ghusl so that he will always be in a state of purity, as is the Sunnah, and because the angels do not come near a person who is in a state of major ritual impurity.\xa0\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There are three things which the angels do not approach: the dead body of a disbeliever, a man who has perfumed himself with saffron (because this is frivolous and foolish behaviour, and is an imitation of women – Qayd al-Qadir, 3/325), and a person who is in a state of major ritual impurity, until he does Ghusl.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 4180; classed as sahih by Al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud, 3522).\nIf a woman is busy and it is not easy for her to do Ghusl from major ritual impurity straight after intercourse, this does not affect her and she is not impure. It is sufficient for her to do Wudu, to reduce the major ritual impurity and so that the angels will come near her.\nCan women who are in a state of major ritual impurity cook or touch things?\nThe claim that some people make, that it is prohibited for a woman who is in a state of major ritual impurity to touch things and to do certain things , is all innovated (Bid`ah) and false ideas which have no basis in Islam. This false belief is based on false and fabricated Hadiths that have been narrated on this topic.\xa0\nShaykh Ash-Shuqairi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Among these false ideas is the notion that if a woman who is in a state of major ritual impurity kneads dough, it becomes corrupt because of her major impurity, and that the blessing will vanish from everything her hand touches.” (As-Sunan wal Mubtada`at, p. 31)\nA similar question was submitted to Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah wal Buhuth. (5/318 – Al-Fatawa). The text of their response is as follows:\n“Praise be to Allah Alone, and blessings and peace be upon His Messenger and his family and Companions.\nYes, it is permissible for a person – whether a man or a woman – who is in a state of major ritual impurity to touch things such as clothes, plates, pots, etc., before doing Ghusl, because this person is not impure and does not make the things he or she touches impure.\xa0\nIt was reported in an authentic Hadith that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) was with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) one day; then he withdrew from him, then he came back. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to him: “Where were you, O Abu Hurayrah?” He said, “I was in a state of major ritual impurity and I did not want to sit with you when I was not pure.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Subhan Allah, a Muslim does not become impure.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 1/333)\nAnd Allah is the Source of strength. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad and his family and Companions and grant them peace.”\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 8828 , 20847 , 27091 , 6533 , and 181351 .\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/6533/can-a-woman-who-is-in-a-state-of-impurity-cook-or-touch-things
