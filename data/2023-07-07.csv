337891,Is it permissible to fast when one has Covid-19?,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThere is nothing special about Covid-19 with regard to fasting, and there is no specific reason connected to Covid-19 that has anything to do with the ruling on fasting or not.\nRather the one who has Covid-19 is like any other sick person, meaning that if it is clearly too difficult for him to fast, then it is permissible for him not to fast, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{So whoever among you is ill or on a journey [during them] - then an equal number of days [are to be made up]}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:184].\nIbn Hazm (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The scholars are unanimously agreed that if sickness weakens a person and makes him unable to fast, then he may break the fast.""(Maratib al-Ijma‘, p. 40).\nSecondly:\nThere are several scenarios for one who is sick:\n1.\xa0If his sickness is mild, meaning that it will not harm him and it does not make it difficult to fast, such as a mild cold or mild headache, then in this case he must fast according to the majority of scholars, and it is haram for him not to fast.\n2.\xa0If his sickness makes it too difficult for him to fast, but it will not harm him, then in this case it is permissible for him not to fast, according to scholarly consensus, as noted above.\n3.\xa0If there is the fear that he may die of this sickness, then it is obligatory for him not to fast, according to the majority of scholars.\n4.\xa0If his sickness will harm him, meaning that fasting will exacerbate his sickness or delay his recovery, then there is a difference of scholarly opinion: is it permissible or obligatory for him to break the fast? The correct view is that it is obligatory.\nSome of the jurists restrict the obligation to break the fast to cases where severe harm will occur.\nIbn Nujaym said in al-Bahr ar-Ra’iq (2/303): The one who fears that his sickness will be exacerbated may break the fast, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{So whoever among you is ill or on a journey [during them] - then an equal number of days [are to be made up]}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:184].\nSo it is permissible for anyone who is sick to break the fast.\nBut the reason why breaking the fast is permitted in the case of sickness is only for the purpose of warding off harm, and what is meant by harm is exacerbation of the sickness, or delay in recovery, or damage caused to some limb or faculty.\nAscertaining that [what will happen if one fasts] may be based on the sick person’s own ijtihad, and his conclusion is not to be based on mere speculation; rather it is based on what is most likely to happen, which in turn is based on some symptoms of his sickness or his experience, or if a Muslim doctor who does not appear to be of bad character tells him that. And it was said that being certain that the doctor who tells him that is of good character is stipulated [in order to accept his advice] …\nThe sick person has the choice between fasting and not fasting, but not fasting is a concession, whereas fasting is a sign of religious commitment, so it is preferable. But if the sick person fears that he may die, then breaking the fast becomes obligatory. This is what it says in al-Bada’i‘. End quote.\n‘Ulaysh said in Minah al-Jalil (2/150): And it is permissible to break the fast because of sickness when the sick person fears, or he is certain or thinks it most likely, based on his own experience, or if he is told by a physician of good character that the sickness will be exacerbated by fasting, or recovery will be delayed, or the sick person will suffer hardship and fatigue as a result of fasting, or even if the sickness will not be exacerbated and recovery will not be delayed [but the individual finds it too difficult to fast].\nBut if the individual fears that he will become sick as a result of fasting, it is not permissible for him to break the fast. This is the correct view, because perhaps that will not happen to him at all.\nAnd it was said that it is permissible.\nIt is obligatory to break the fast, whether the individual is sick or healthy, if he fears, or he is certain or thinks it most likely that he may die or suffer severe harm that will lead to losing a faculty such as his vision, if he fasts, because preserving life and faculties is obligatory. End quote.\nIt says in Mughni al-Muhtaj (2/169): It is permissible for the sick person not to fast, with the intention of availing himself of the concession, according to the religious texts and scholarly consensus, if that will lead to severe harm and the harm is of the type that makes tayammum permissible. This is what is mentioned in ash-Sharhayn wa’r-Rawdah. As for what the author said – that the sick person for whom fasting is too difficult or he will be greatly harmed by it – this means that either of the two is sufficient [to allow him not to fast]. That, as al-Isnawi said, is the correct view. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{and do not throw [yourselves] with your [own] hands into destruction}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:195].\n… And he must break the fast if he fears death, as was stated by al-Ghazali and others, and was affirmed by al-Adhra‘i. End quote.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Kafi (1/434): The sick person may break his fast, but he must make it up, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{So whoever among you is ill or on a journey [during them] - then an equal number of days [are to be made up]}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:184].\nWhat makes it permissible not to fast is the fear that fasting may exacerbate his sickness or delay recovery.\nAs for that which is not affected by fasting, such as toothache or a pain in the finger, and the like, that does not make it permissible to break the fast, because no harm will result from fasting. If someone starts the day fasting then falls sick during the day, he may break the fast, because harm is already there. End quote.\nThe correct view is that if fasting will cause him harm, then he must break the fast.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is permissible for a sick person [to break the fast] if fasting will harm him. So if a person is sick and could be harmed by fasting, then breaking the fast is prescribed in his case. This is according to what the author (may Allah have mercy on him) said.\nIf he does not break the fast, then he is turning away from the concession granted by Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, and turning away from the concession granted by Allah is wrong. What the individual should do is accept the concession granted by Allah.\nThe correct view is that if fasting will harm him, then fasting becomes haram and breaking the fast becomes obligatory, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{ And do not kill yourselves}\xa0[an-Nisa’ 4:29].\nThis prohibition includes fasting, if it could lead to death, or if it could lead to harm.\nThe evidence that it includes that which could lead to harm is the hadith of ‘Amr ibn al-‘As (may Allah be pleased with him): when he led his companions in prayer whilst in a state of janabah, but he was afraid of the cold, so he did tayammum. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to him: “Did you lead your companions in prayer when you were junub?” He said: O Messenger of Allah, I remembered the words of Allah, may He be exalted: (interpretation of the meaning): {And do not kill yourselves} [an-Nisa’ 4:29], and I was afraid of the cold. And the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) approved of what he had done.\nIn the case of one who is sick, there may be different scenarios:\n1.\xa0He will not be affected by fasting, as in the case of a mild cold, or a mild headache, or a toothache, and the like. In this case it is not permissible for him to break the fast, even though some of the scholars said that that is permissible for him, because of the general meaning of the verse {and whoever is ill…} [al-Baqarah 2:185]. But we said: This ruling is based on the reason for it, so when breaking the fast is kinder to him, in that case we say that he may break the fast. But if fasting will not affect him, it is not permissible for him to break the fast and it is obligatory for him to fast.\n2.\xa0If it is very difficult for him to fast, but it will not harm him, then in this case it is disliked (makruh) for him to fast and it is prescribed for him to break the fast.\n3.\xa0If it is too difficult for him to fast and doing so will harm him, as in the case of a man who has kidney disease or diabetes and the like, then in this case it is haram for him to fast.\nBut if he does fast in this case, is his fast valid?\nAbu Muhammad ibn Hazm (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is not valid for him to fast, because Allah, may He be exalted, ruled that one who is sick may fast on other days. So if he fasts when he is sick, he is like one who is able to fast, but fasted in Sha‘ban instead of Ramadan, so his fast is not valid and he must make it up.\nThis view of Abu Muhammad is based on the famous principal that whatever is forbidden in and of itself, if it happens it is not valid. So if we say that it is haram, then according to the juristic principle, if he fasts it is not valid, because he observed a fast that was prohibited, like fasting on the days of at-tashriq and on the days of the two Eids; it is not permissible and it is not valid.\nThus to those sick people who decide that it is better to fast when fasting is difficult for them and may harm them, but they insist on fasting, we say that they did wrong when they did not accept the kindness of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, and they did not accept His concession, and they harmed themselves. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And do not kill yourselves}\xa0[an-Nisa’ 4:29].\nEnd quote from ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘ (6/340).\nAnd he (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If someone were to ask: how do we determine whether fasting will cause harm and to what degree?\nWe say: harm is determined by how a person feels, and it may be known if a doctor tells him. As for his feelings, that means that he feels himself that fasting will harm him, cause more pain or delay recovery, and the like.\nAs for being told by a doctor, that means that a knowledgeable and trustworthy doctor tells him that it will harm him. If an ordinary person who is not a doctor tells him that, however, he should not take his word for it, and if someone who is not a knowledgeable doctor – rather he is someone who is involved in the medical field – tells him that, he should not take his word for it either. And if an untrustworthy doctor told him that, he should not take his word for it.\nIs it stipulated that the doctor should be a Muslim in order to be trustworthy, because non-Muslims are not to be trusted?\nThere are two scholarly views concerning that. The correct view is that it is not stipulated, and that if we trust what he says, we may follow his advice not to fast, because that is his profession, and a non-Muslim may be sincere to his profession and keen to uphold his reputation as a doctor, so that he only says what he believes to be true. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) trusted a disbeliever in the most risky situation, which was when he migrated from Makkah to Madinah. He hired a polytheist man from the tribe of Banu’d-Dayyal who was called ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Urayqit, as his guide during the journey. This was a very risky matter, because Quraysh were searching for the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and were offering a reward of one hundred she-camels to the one who brought news of him. But the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) trusted him, which indicates that if we trust a polytheist, then we may accept his word.""(Ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘\xa0 6/328).\nConclusion:\nThe one who has Covid-19 is sick, like any other sick person. If fasting will harm him by exacerbating his sickness or delaying recovery, according to the testimony of a trustworthy doctor, or because he feels that himself, then he must break the fast.\nIf fasting will not harm him, but it will cause him considerable hardship, then it is permissible for him to break the fast.\nBut breaking the fast has nothing to do with protecting oneself against sickness. There is no proof of that at all, and no one who has knowledge of medicine or is qualified to speak about such matters said that. So you should beware of the rumours that some people are spreading which have no scientific basis.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/337891/is-it-obligatory-to-fast-ramadan-for-one-who-has-covid-19
314889,"How can we reconcile between the verse {He is not questioned about what He does, but they will be questioned} [al-Anbiya’ 21:23] and the verse {And [mention, O Muhammad], when your Lord said to the angels, “Indeed, I will make upon the earth successive generations.” They said, “Will You place upon it those who cause corruption therein and shed blood, while we declare Your praise and sanctify You?”} [al-Baqarah 2:29]?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nRegarding the angels’ questioning of Allah that is mentioned in Surat al-Baqarah, it was a question aimed at finding out and seeking to understand and learn something new. It was not an importunate question or an objection, for they are far above such a thing, may Allah’s peace be upon all of them. And it was said that Allah, may He be exalted, gave them permission to ask, so they asked.\nMakki said in al-Hidayah (1/216-217): Many of the commentators narrated that the angels were aware that the jinn who dwelt on earth had caused a great deal of mischief and shed blood, so they asked by way of wanting to learn the reason and seeking new knowledge: {Will You place upon it one who causes corruption therein and sheds blood?} In other words, will they be like those who spread mischief?\nThus they asked for the purpose of seeking to learn, not to object, because they had no knowledge of how these successive generations would be, which Allah told them He was going to create. It was said that they said that by way of wondering, as the Arabs say: Will you show kindness to So-and-so, when he mistreats you?\nAnd it was said that Allah, may He be exalted, gave them permission to ask about that.\nAnd it was said that Allah, may He be exalted, mentioned that by way of informing them that He was going to create successive generations on earth, so they asked by way of seeking knowledge: What are those successive generations going to be like? So He said: He [Adam] will have progeny who will spread mischief on earth and shed blood, whereupon they said by way of astonishment and seeking confirmation, not by way of objecting: “Will You place upon it those who cause corruption therein and shed blood?”\nAnd it was said that they said that by way of astonishment at what Allah told them about those successive generations causing mischief on earth and shedding blood. End quote.\nAl-Wahidi narrated in al-Basit (2/324) the views of scholars in response to that, as he said:\nSome of the commentators said that there is an implicit meaning that is stated briefly. What it means is: are You going to place in it those who will spread corruption in it [and shed blood? Or are You going to place in it those who will not spread mischief in it] or shed blood? This is like the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says: {Is one who is devoutly obedient during periods of the night …?} [az-Zumar 39:9], meaning: is he like one who is not devoutly obedient? And it is like the words of the poet Abu Dhu’ayb:\nI went against my gut instinct, for I am obedient to her command, and I do not know whether pursuing her is wise.\nWhat he meant is: is it wise or foolish?\nBased on that, the angels were seeking to understand and perhaps be told something of which they were not aware; it was not their intention to disapprove or object. Then Allah said: {“Indeed, I know that which you do not know”} [al-Baqarah 2:29]. He did not inform them about the character of the sons of Adam and He did not explain to them whether He wanted to create someone who would spread mischief or would not spread mischief.\nIt was said that when Allah said {“Indeed, I will make upon the earth successive generations”}, the angels did not know what type of creatures those successive generations would be. They said: O our Lord, will You place on the earth successive generations who will spread mischief like the children of the jinn? Or will You make successive generations from among the angels? For we glorify and praise You. But Allah did not inform them about that, and he said: {“Indeed, I know that which you do not know”} – in other words: among them will be both those who are obedient and those who are disobedient.\nAz-Zajjaaj said, narrating from someone else: what is meant here is that Allah informed the angels that He was going to place on the earth successive generations, and the successive generations were a group of the sons of Adam who would shed blood. Allah gave the angels permission to ask Him about that, and His informing them of that served to further confirm to them that He knows the unseen. It is as if they said: Are You going to create in it people who will shed blood and disobey You? Rather what they should do when they realise that You have created them is glorify and praise You as we do, and sanctify You as we do. They only said that when they were given permission to ask, because Allah, may He be exalted, has described them as doing what they are commanded. End quote.\nIbn Kathir (1/216) said: What the angels said was not by way of objecting to Allah, or by way of envy for the sons of Adam, as some commentators thought. Allah, may He be exalted, has described the angels as {They do not speak until He has spoken} [al-Anbiya’ 21:27]; in other words, they do not ask Him about anything for which they are not given permission.\nWhen Allah told them that He was going to create a new creation on earth, Qatadah said: They already knew that they [the new creation] would spread mischief on earth, so they said: {“Will You place upon it…”}. That was a question by way of enquiring and finding out the wisdom behind that. They said: O our Lord, what is the wisdom behind creating these people, even though some of them will spread mischief on earth and shed blood? For if the purpose is that they should worship You, we already glorify and praise You and sanctify You. In other words, we pray to You and we will not do anything of that manner at all, so why did You not decree that we are enough?\nAllah, may He be exalted, said, responding to this question of theirs: {“Indeed, I know that which you do not know”}. That is, I know that there is a greater purpose in creating such people, which outweighs the mischief that you refer to, which you do not know, for there will be Prophets and Messengers among them, and among them there will be those who are strong and true in faith, martyrs, righteous people, devoted worshippers, ascetics, close friends of Mine, devout people, those who are close to Me, scholars who act in accordance with their knowledge, those who fear Me, those who love Me, and those who will follow the Messengers (blessings and peace of Allah be upon them). End quote.\nSecondly:\nWith regard to the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says: {He is not questioned about what He does, but they will be questioned} [al-Anbiya’ 21:23], it is similar to the verse {Indeed, Allah does what He wills} [al-Hajj 22:13].\nWhat is meant is that Allah, may He be exalted, is the One Who controls His creation in whatever way He wills, for His is the power of creation and His is the command, and it is He Who is in control. Just as He creates them however He wills, blesses whomever He wills, dooms whoever He wills, grants good health to whomever He wills, decrees sickness for whomever He wills, supports whomever He wills, and forsakes whomever He wills, in like manner He rules over His slaves however He wills. Therefore He permits whatever He wills, forbids whatever He wills, allows whatever He wills, and proscribes whatever He wills, for when Allah decrees [a thing], none can reverse His decree.""(Tafsir Ibn Kathir\xa0 1/387).\nIt says in Tafsir al-Wasit – Majma‘ al-Buhuth (6/1102): This is an elaboration on the fact that He, may He be glorified, is one and unique in His divinity and majestic in His Lordship, and in the fact that He questions His slaves about what they do, but He is not to be questioned by them about what He does to them. The great scholar az-Zamakhshari said, commenting on this verse: As it is the case that usually subjects do not question kings about their actions or the way in which they run the affairs of their kingdoms, out of respect and awe, despite the fact that kings are susceptible to error, mistakes and all kinds of mischief, by the same token it is more appropriate that the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, their Creator and Provider, is not to be questioned about what He does, especially when it is known and well established that everything He does is rational and based on wisdom, so it is not possible for Him to make mistakes or do anything abhorrent. End quote.\nAs for people, they will be questioned, because they are His slaves and are obliged to obey Him and act in accordance with His laws which He prescribed for them on the lips of His Messengers, and because of what He has given them of sound reason, which enables them to distinguish truth from falsehood, good from evil, and benefit from harm.\nAmong those of His slaves whom He will question are those whom people associate with Him, such as the Messiah and the angels; so how can those whom they worshipped be deserving of that worship when they too will be questioned by the One God, may He be glorified and exalted? End quote.\nConclusion:\nAllah, may He be exalted, may be asked for the purpose of learning with humility, or He may be asked for the purpose of seeking guidance and knowledge, but He is not to be questioned by way of objection or disapproval of anything that He does, may He be glorified.\nThe question of the angels was a question that was aimed at learning, for they were aware of the rights of their Lord, and they glorified and praised Him, for they are the ones who do not disobey Allah in what He commands them, and they do as they are commanded.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/314889/the-angels-questioned-allah-in-order-to-find-out-and-learn
