363929,"can I be obedient to anyone or especially to my parents' request on something which I know will harm them? Let's say my mother asks me to bring her medicine that will stop her headache. But I know and anyone who studies these subjects a little bit knows that these products contain chemicals and other substances which are dangerous to the body. Similarly, if my mother asks me to bring her processed foods which contain sugar and other substances. How do I have to handle the situation? I feel like I know that these things that they ask me finally will cause them cancer, type 2 diabetes, high blood sugar, and other damages. What should I do?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nObedience to parents is obligatory in all permissible matters that are beneficial to them and do not cause harm to the child.\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: ""It is incumbent upon a person to obey his parents in matters other than sin, even if they (the parents) are sinful, and this is the apparent meaning of Ahmad\'s statement; this is in matters that are beneficial to them and not harmful. If it is difficult for him but does not harm him, it is obligatory, otherwise, it is not."" End quote from ""Al-Fatawa Al-Kubra"" (5/381).\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar stated regarding the definition of disobedience (`uquq): ""It refers to the occurrence of something that causes the parent to be hurt by their child, whether by word or deed, except in polytheism or sin, unless the parent is being unreasonable."" End quote from Fath Al-Bari (10/406).\nSecondly:\nManufactured medicines are not free from side effects that result from them. The principle of dealing with them is to weigh the benefits and harms. If their benefits and interests prevail, the harm is tolerated. If the harm prevails, they must be avoided; because one of the principles of Shari`ah is that ""harm is not removed by harm.""\nAnd if the benefit and harm are equal, this is a matter for consideration and Ijtihad.\nThe reference in this is to the doctors.\nMedicines – as is known – are not licensed for sale in pharmacies except after permission from the competent authorities, which means that they have undergone trials that prove their benefits are greater than the side effects they may cause, but these effects may increase for some individuals, so the doctor orders them to refrain from this medicine, and these are individual cases.\nTherefore, it is permissible to take medicines that contain chemical substances if the benefit is predominant, and this is the reality, as well as consuming manufactured foods that contain sugar or colors or preservatives, due to the predominance of their benefit, despite the presence of harm in them, but their harm is tolerable in light of their benefit.\nWe do not know of anyone from the scholars who has prohibited the consumption of what has been mentioned, so beware of prohibiting what Allah has permitted, and of speaking about Allah without knowledge. If medicines were to be completely abandoned due to their side effects, it would be necessary to eliminate most of them and leave people suffering from pain and the compounded effects resulting from the continuation and aggravation of the disease.\nIn conclusion:\nIf your parents order you to bring medicine prescribed for them by a doctor, then hasten to bring it, or if they order you to bring food containing sugar, then comply with their order; for they only command you with what is permissible, and they are hurt by your disobedience to them in that.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/363929/obedience-to-parents-in-bringing-them-medication
143056,Why do we recite Dhuhr and Asr prayer in low voice when it is clearly mentioned in the Quran the following?,"[""Praise be to Allah.Why are Dhuhr and `Asr prayers silent?\nIt was decreed that recitation in Dhuhr and `Asr should be done silently because the time of these prayers is during the day, and at that time a person's mind may be preoccupied with a lot of thoughts, as he is busy with his work or trade or manufacturing.\xa0\nIf the recitation were to be done out loud, his mind would be distracted and he would not listen attentively to the Imam’s recitation; he would not listen to it or devote his attention to it; rather other things would come to mind and distract him. So he was commanded to recite to himself so that his recitation will make him think and ponder.\xa0\nIt is well known that if people pray in congregation for Dhuhr or `Asr prayer, they should not recite out loud, because then they would distract one another. So both the Imam and those praying behind him are enjoined to recite silently.\xa0\nWhy are Fajr, Maghrib,\xa0 and `Isha prayers recited aloud?\nBut with regard to the prayers that are offered during the night , in most cases people are free from distractions so the Imam is enjoined to recite out loud, so that others may benefit from his recitation.\xa0\nRecitation in Qiyam Al-Layl and Tahajjud\nWith regard to the verse which reads: “Do not recite your prayers too loudly or silently, but seek a way between” (Al-Isra’ 17:110), it applies only to Qiyam Al-Layl and Tahajjud.\xa0\nIf a person is praying and there are people around him who are listening to his recitation and others who are asleep, then he should not recite so loudly as not to disturb those who are sleeping or so quietly as to cause those who are listening to him to miss out on any benefit; rather he should recite at a moderate volume, enough to be heard but not so loud as to disturb those who are asleep.\xa0\nIt also states in the verse that the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to recite out loud and the polytheists heard him and revealed the Quran and the one who had bought it, so he was forbidden to recite out loud and he began to recite silently, but then the members of his household and those who were listening to him missed out on the benefit, so he was enjoined to recite at a moderate volume.\xa0\nFor more details, please refer to the following answers: 26268 , 224152 , 197414 , 67618 , 114369 .\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/143056/why-are-dhuhr-and-asr-prayers-silent
386966,"I am married with 6 kids and live in Australia. My kids were praying 5 times a day but recently my oldest son left Islam and the rest have gone to praying 2 - 3 times a day. I have been telling my wife about making Hijrah but she refuses because of the fear of money and health. I have become weak in my eman coz my surroundings are full kafir with no Muslim friends or family to socialize with. She won\'t even move to a city with a bigger Muslim population coz of kids\' schooling. she refuses to come to an agreement. The only option I have been given is to take all the kids but the kids don\'t want to do anything without their mother. She tells me it\'s too late to make hijrah. Given my circumstances, can I make hijrah without my family as I don\'t see any hope being here any longer? Will I be accountable for making hijrah without my family?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThere is no doubt that the situation your children have ended up in is the harsh and heavy price that families pay as a result of living in non-Muslim countries, whether in the West or the East, which ultimately leads to the children becoming westernized or easternized, or following whatever their desires dictate, in a direction far from the Religion of Allah and His pleasure; except for those whom my Lord has mercy upon; and they are few.\nFor benefit, please see the answer to question no. 52893 .\nSecondly:\nWhat you are considering, migrating to a Muslim country and leaving your family and children behind, is not the ideal solution; because it involves neglecting the trust and responsibility of raising children, which is a significant matter.\nFrom `Abdullah ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: ""Each of you is a shepherd and is responsible for his flock: the ruler who governs the people is a shepherd and is responsible for them, a man is a shepherd over the members of his household and is responsible for them, a woman is a shepherd over her husband\'s house and children and is responsible for them, and a slave is a shepherd over his master\'s property and is responsible for it. So, all of you are shepherds and each of you is responsible for his flock."" Narrated by Al-Bukhari (2554) and Muslim (1829).\nAnd from Ma`qil ibn Yasar, who said: I heard the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) saying: ""There is no servant whom Allah has given responsibility over a flock, and he does not protect them with sincere advice, except that he will not find the fragrance of Paradise."" Narrated by Al-Bukhari (7150) and Muslim (142).\nTherefore, your staying with your family, advising them, striving in their upbringing and guidance, falls under the reform mentioned in the words of Allah (translation of the meaning):\n{I only intend reform as much as I am able. And my success is not but through Allāh. Upon Him I have relied, and to Him I return.} Hud (88).\nA Muslim sometimes faces situations in life where he is between two goods and chooses the better of them, or between two evils and chooses the lesser of them.\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n""The perfection of \'piety (scrupulousness)\' is for a person to know the better of two goods and the worse of two evils, and to know that the Shari`ah is built upon achieving and perfecting benefits, and eliminating and minimizing harms. Otherwise, one who does not weigh the benefits and harms of an action or inaction according to the Shari`ah might neglect obligations and commit prohibitions."" End quote from ""Majmu` al-Fatawa"" (10/512).\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n""The intelligent person should know that reason and Shari`ah mandate achieving and perfecting benefits and eliminating and minimizing harms. When an intelligent person faces a matter in which he sees both a benefit and a harm, he is obliged to do two things: a matter of knowledge and a matter of action. The matter of knowledge is to seek to understand which is more predominant between the two sides of benefit and harm. Once it becomes clear to him which is more predominant, he is obliged to choose what is better for him."" End quote from ""Al-Da\' wa Al-Dawa\'"" (p. 491).\nIn conclusion:\nThe first thing you should do, if you are unable to reform them in your place and they do not agree to move with you to a better country, is to try to get custody of the younger ones, whom you can take care of, control, and reform, and bring them back to the path of their Religion as much as possible and within your capacity. Move with them to a Muslim country, where you can live among (Muslim) people and where you can reform their Religion.\nIf you are unable to do so, then move with them to another region, in the midst of a Muslim community, where you can be stronger in establishing your Religion for yourself and reforming your children as much as you can.\nHowever, in any case, we see that your leaving your children behind - if you are unable to migrate with them - leaving them in the hands of your wife, whose condition you have described, is a kind of neglecting the trust; and the better thing to do, if you are unable to move with them, is to stay with them as a guide, educator, and advisor, striving to reform them and yourself, and your wife as much as you can; until Allah provides relief and a way out for you and them, and enables you to improve them and guide them, or they grow up, and your authority over them ceases, and you are unable to return them or reform anything from them; then at that time, you are on your own; and every soul is held in pledge for what it has earned.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/386966/he-fears-for-his-kids-in-non-muslims-lands
44696,"Did Prophet Muhammed (saw) apply surma (kohl) to his eyes? And are there any Hadiths that narrate this? In the USA kohl is banned as it causes lead poisoning (as they say). Can this be true? because I would like to apply it as well, as I suffer from poor vision.","['Praise be to Allah.In a number of Hadiths it is narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used kohl and commanded others to do so. For example it is narrated in the Musannaf of Ibn Abu Shaybah (may Allah have mercy on him), from the Hadith of Anas (may Allah be pleased with him), that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to apply kohl to his right eye three times, and to his left eye twice. This Hadith was classed as authentic by Al-Albani in As-Silsilah As-Sahihah no. 633. And it was proven in Sunan An-Nasa’i (5113) and Sunan Abu Dawud (3837) and elsewhere, from the Hadith of Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The best of your kohl is ithmid (antimony), for it makes the vision clear and makes the hair\xa0 grow.”\xa0\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Kohl protects the health of the eyes and gives strength and clarity of vision, and cleanses the eye of bad substances. In addition to that some types of kohl also serve as an adornment and if it is applied before going to bed this is even better, and ithmid is more efficacious than other types of kohl.” (Zad Al-Ma`ad, 4/281)\xa0\nIt says in Al-Mughni: “It is recommended to use kohl an odd number of times.” (Al-Mughni, 1/106)\nIt says in Al-Majmu`: “With regard to using kohl an odd number of times, there is a difference of scholarly opinion. It was said that it should be applied an odd number of times to one eye and an even number of times to the other, so that the total number will be odd. The correct view of the scholars who examined this issue is that it should be applied an odd number of times to each eye. Based on this, the Sunnah is to apply it three times to each eye.” (Al-Majmu` 1/334)\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthyamin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Some eye doctors say that kohl is harmful to the eyes and they advise not using it. What do you say to them?\xa0\nHe replied:\xa0\n“Ithmid (antimony) is known to be very good for the eyes. I do not know anything about other types of kohl. Trustworthy doctors are the ones whom we should consult on this matter.\xa0\nIt was said of Zarqa’ Al-Yamamah, who could see as far as three days, that when she was killed, they saw that all the veins of her eyes bore traces of this ithmid.” (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, vol. 17; Chapter on medical treatment and visiting the sick)\xa0\nFrom the above it is known that kohl is good and is not harmful to the eyes, rather it is beneficial. But there may be some kinds of modern, manufactured kohl that contain some chemical ingredients which may cause physical damage and remove some of the benefits of kohl. Hence people nowadays should look for pure kohl and not regard every kind of kohl available nowadays as beneficial.\nFor more details, please refer to the following answers: 67897 , 34552 , 103345 , 32556 , 118089 , 22922 , and 144957 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/44696/is-kohl-beneficial-to-the-eyes
