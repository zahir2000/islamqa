363652,"Her husband said to her that if she talks about her past, she is automatically divorced when she talks about it. He also said that whenever she would talk about her past, she is divorced one time, if she talks about it the second time, she would be the second divorced, and if she talks about it the third time, she is divorced the third time. They both didn't know about conditional divorce. She took permission from her husband and talk about her past many times with him. After she learned about conditional divorce, he asked her husband about that. Her husband said to her that he put the condition on specific past things, not all things. He told her that by saying "" you are divorced when you talk about your past"" he meant specific past things not all. Her husband said to her that she didn't break the condition because she didn't talk about what past things he meant. Can she trust her husband?. Did conditional divorce occurred?. ( note they didn't consummate the marriage). Plz, brother gives her a fatwa. ( her country's people follow the school of Hanafi). If it possible please brother give a reference so she would have no doubt","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIf the husband made the divorce dependent upon a condition and that condition was not met, then the divorce does not count as such.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf the husband connected the divorce to a particular time or to a specific condition, and made it dependent on that, it does not come into effect unless that condition is met or that time comes. This is the view of Ibn ‘Abbas, ‘Ata’, Jabir ibn Zayd, an-Nakha‘i, Abu Hashim (i.e., Yahya ibn Dinar), ath-Thawri, ash-Shafa‘i, Abu ‘Ubayd and ashab ar-ra’y.""(Al-Mughni\xa0 10/410).\nIf the divorcing husband uttered general words and said: I meant it to be specific, that is to be accepted from him, because general words may often be used to refer to specific meanings, and his intention makes specific what is general in wording and restricts that which is open-ended, as was stated by Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) and others.\nSee: at-Turuq al-Hukmiyyah fi’s-Siyasah ash-Shar ‘iyyah by Ibn al-Qayyim (2/803).\nAl-Bahuti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf in his heart he intended to exempt one of his wives from the general statements of divorce, such as if he said that his wives were divorced, but he intended to exclude So-and-so from that, then this exemption is valid and she is not divorced, because his saying “My wives are divorced” is a general statement, and it could be used to refer to some of what he mentioned, because using a general phrase to refer to something specific is something that is commonly accepted in ordinary speech.""(Ar-Rawd al-Murbi‘\xa0 6/531).\nHe also said (6/574, 575).\nIf someone says to his wife: “If I start talking to you, then you are divorced,” then she starts to speak, his oath becomes no longer applicable, because she spoke to him first and he did not speak to her first… unless what he meant was if he was the first to speak to her in some other situation. If that was what he meant, then it is to be understood according to what he meant and intended. End quote.\nBased on that, so long as the husband connected his words to specific things in the past, then he is to be believed with regard to what he said about his intention, and that is to be accepted from him. Thus the condition should be based on his intention, and you said that the wife did not speak about the things that the husband meant that she should not talk about, so no divorce takes place.\nThirdly:\nIf the man connected the divorce of his wife to a specific matter, as mentioned in the question and the like, then he has no right to retract the conditions he specified or to give her permission to do that thing. Rather if she does it, then he has broken his oath.\nAl-Bahuti (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The man who stipulated the condition for divorce of his wife has no right to cancel that condition, because cancelling it means that it is no longer applicable, but what happened cannot be deemed to no longer be applicable. So if the thing that was stipulated in order for divorce to occur happens, which is described as the condition, then she is divorced because that condition was met, and if it does not happen, then she is not divorced.""(Kashshaf al-Qina‘\xa0 12/297).\nSee also the answer to question no. 105438 .\nFourthly:\nIf it so happened that the wife spoke about what her husband meant with regard to her past, then most of the scholars say that the divorce counts as such, and the divorce is repeated every time she speaks of that, because the husband uttered the words “every time”, which is indicative of repetition.\nBut if that happened before the marriage was consummated, she is completely divorced by one talaq (divorce), and no other talaq counts after that.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah favoured the view that a conditional divorce counts as such if the husband intended that it should count, when that condition is met.\nBut if the husband’s intention was to prevent his wife from talking about a specific matter, then this comes under the ruling on oaths, and it does not count as a divorce, but the husband must offer expiation for breaking an oath (kaffarat yameen) if his wife goes against him.\nThis has been explained previously in the answer to question no. 229507 .\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about a woman who visits her family a great deal, and her husband said to her: “If you go to your family again, then you are divorced.” He said: She started to cry and urged me to change that, and I felt sorry for her, so I tried to find a way to re-interpret what I had said, and I told her: If you go to your family without my permission, then you are divorced, and now I give you permission to go.\nHe said: But I am not comfortable about that, because I did not ask any scholar about it; rather we carried on with our marital life as it had been.\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) replied:\nBefore answering this question, I would like to offer some advice. How often some Muslims do things which require us to give them some advice about those matters. I would like to say:\nAny action that a person does when he does not know the Islamic ruling concerning it, he is taking a risk by doing it. What the believer should do, when he wants to do some deed – whether it is an act of worship or some interaction with other people – is not to do anything until he finds out the Islamic rulings regarding it, so that he will be acting on the basis of knowledge, especially with regard to such serious matters as marriage and divorce.\nThe fact that a man does not realise what he has done until after he has been stricken with something which he may think is because of his infraction means that it is not appropriate for a believer or one who is prudent to do that thing. When that happened, this brother should have asked us, before trying to interpret things for himself on the basis of ignorance. I ask Allah to turn in mercy to us and to him.\nWith regard to the answer to his specific question, I say:\nIf, when this man said to his wife, “If you go to your family, then you are divorced,” he intended to threaten her and prevent her from going to her family, then this is regarded as coming under the ruling on oaths, and he may change his mind and offer expiation for breaking an oath (kaffarat yamin), which is freeing a slave, or feeding or clothing ten poor persons. If he cannot afford that, then he must fast for three days.\nBut if what he meant by saying “If you go to your family, then you are divorced” was divorce, and the idea that he had in mind was that she would be divorced if she disobeyed him and went against his wishes, and he does not want her to remain his wife, then in that case the divorce counts as such if she went to her family.\nHe cannot change this condition, meaning that he cannot add another condition to it or cancel it completely. So he cannot say the last thing he said: which was “If you go to your family without my permission, then you are divorced.” This does not count for anything, because by stipulating a condition the first time, the ruling became binding, which is that the divorce that was dependent upon this action of the wife would come into effect if she did that action. So he cannot add anything to it or subtract anything from it, or cancel it altogether.\nBased on that, if she went to her family, then she is divorced as a result of going to her family. If the divorce was revocable (first or second talaq), then he can take her back so long as her ‘iddah has not yet ended.\nYes, if he intended from the outset, that “if you go to your family, then you are divorced,” and he meant “without permission from me,” this intention makes the general statement specific, so if she went out with his permission, there is no blame on either of them.""(Fatawa Nur ‘ala ad-Darb\xa021/2).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/363652/is-it-valid-for-the-husband-to-retract-a-conditional-divorce-or-limit-it-after-uttering-it-by-stating-his-intention
493375,"If two people agree on the sale and purchase of a house and on a time for payment, then the purchaser delays payment, so he makes an agreement with the seller that he will pay off the value in gold, is that valid? What is the ruling on penalty clauses in a contract for the sale and purchase of land?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIf the purchaser delays payment of the price, and makes an agreement with the seller that he will pay off the amount in gold, that may be done in one of two ways:\n-1-\xa0The first way is paying the balance in gold immediately. There is nothing wrong with that if it is based on the price of gold on the day that the payment is to be made, or less than that. This is regarded as an exchange between gold and what the man owes in Egyptian pounds, and making an exchange for what one owes is like immediately paying for what you have purchased.\nThe basic principle regarding that is the report narrated by Ahmad (6239), Abu Dawud (3354), an-Nasa’i (4582), at-Tirmidhi (1242) and Ibn Majah (2262) from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: I used to sell camels for dinars [i.e to be paid at a later date] and accept dirhams, and I would sell them for dirhams and accept dinars. I asked the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) about that and he said: “There is nothing wrong with you accepting payment based on the current price, so long as you do not part when there is something still outstanding between you.” \xa0\nThe hadith was classed as sahih by some of the scholars, such as an-Nawawi and Ahmad Shakir. Others classed it as sahih on the basis that it is the words of Ibn ‘Umar, not the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), including al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar and al-Albani. See: Irwa’ al-Ghalil (5/173).\nIt is only prohibited to charge more than the current price of gold, so that the seller will not make a profit on something that he was never liable for.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is permissible to exchange one of the two currencies (gold and silver) for the other, in the case of purchasing or paying what one owes, according to most of the scholars.\nEnd quote from al-Mughni (4/37); he quoted as evidence the hadith of Ibn ‘Umar.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: What he must do is pay back what you loaned him in dollars, because this is the nature of the loan that you gave him.\nBut despite that, if you both agreed that he would give you Egyptian pounds, there is nothing wrong with that. Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I used to sell camels in al-Baqi‘ – or an-Naqi‘ – for dirhams, but we would accept the payment in dinars; and we would sell for dinars but accept the payment in dirhams. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There is nothing wrong with you accepting payment based on the current price, so long as you do not part when there is something still outstanding between you.” This is selling currency for currency of a different kind, so it is more akin to selling gold for silver.\nSo if you and he have agreed that he will give you Egyptian pounds instead of dollars, on condition that you do not take more in pounds than the equivalent at the time of the exchange, there is nothing wrong with that.\nFor example, if 2000 dollars is equivalent to 2800 pounds, it is not permissible for you to take 3000 pounds from him, but it is permissible for you to take 2800 pounds. And it is permissible for you to take only 2000 dollars from him, meaning that you take the current price or less, and do not take more, because if you take more, then you will have made a profit on something for which you were never liable, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade making a profit on something for which you were never liable. But if you take less, this is like taking some of what is due to you and letting him off regarding the rest, and there is nothing wrong with that.""(Fatawa Islamiyyah (2/414).\n-2-\xa0The second way is where he does not give him gold at present; rather they both agree on gold to be given later on, based on the price of gold on the day of the missed payment or at the current price on the day the agreement was made. This is haram, because it is a delayed exchange, as you are exchanging what you are owed of pounds for gold to be delivered later on. This is riba (usury), because it is stipulated that when exchanging currency for gold, or vice versa, the exchange must be done immediately, on the spot, because of the report narrated by Muslim (1588) from Abu Hurayrah, that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Dinar for dinar with no difference between them and dirham for dirham with no difference between them.”\nAnd it was narrated that ‘Ubadah ibn as-Samit (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Gold for gold, silver for silver, wheat for wheat, barley for barley, dates for dates, salt for salt, like for like, same for same, hand to hand. But if these commodities differ, then sell as you like, as long as it is hand to hand.” Narrated by Muslim (1587).\nCurrencies come under the same rulings as gold and silver, so any exchange must be hand to hand.\nBased on that, the buyer still owes pounds, and it is not permissible to make an agreement that he owes gold of whatever price.\nThe solution in this case, so that the seller’s rights will not be affected, is for him to cancel the deal, take back the house and give back the instalments that the purchaser had paid to him.\nThe scholars have stated that it is permissible for the seller to cancel the deal if the purchaser is in financial difficulty or is taking too long to pay.\nIt says in al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (32/136): Ibn Taymiyah said that if the purchaser is in financial difficulty or is taking too long to pay, the seller may cancel the deal so as to ward off the harm to which dispute may lead. He said in al-Insaf: This is the correct view. End quote.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said: If the seller knows that the purchaser is in financial difficulty, then he has no choice. For example, if a man sells an item to someone thinking that he is rich, then he finds out that he is in financial difficulty, he has the right to cancel the deal, because allowing more time to pay could be detrimental to his own interests.\nBut if he sold this item to someone already knowing that he was in financial difficulty, he has no option to cancel, because he entered into the transaction fully aware [of the purchaser’s situation].""(Ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘\xa0 8/364).\nHe also said: If it turns out that the purchaser is the kind to take too long to pay, then the seller may cancel the deal, because some of those who take too long to pay may cause more trouble than the poor, for it may be that Allah will bless the poor man and he will pay what he owes, whereas if taking too long to pay is a person’s usual habit, then it will be very difficult to get him to pay it off. The correct view is that the seller may cancel the deal in order to protect his wealth.\nAnother benefit [of being allowed to cancel the deal], in addition to protecting the seller’s wealth, is that it will serve as a deterrent to the one who takes too long to pay, because if such a person knows that if he takes too long to pay, the deal will be cancelled, he will shape up and will not take too long to pay in the future.""(Ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘ (8/364).\nSecondly:\nIt is permissible to stipulate penalty clauses in financial transactions, except in contracts in which there is a commitment to pay off a debt. It is not permissible, for example, to stipulate that the one who purchases land for payment to be made later or by instalments must pay something in addition to the price if he delays payment, because this extra payment is in addition to the original amount of the debt, and that is blatant riba.\nWith regard to duties and obligations other than the debt, it is permissible to stipulate a penalty regarding them, such as if it is stipulated that the one who cancels the deal must pay some money, or if the contractor delays carrying out the work, he must pay such and such for each day. For more details regarding that, please see the answers to questions no. 112090 and 354831 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/493375/the-purchaser-delayed-payment-is-it-permissible-to-make-an-agreement-with-him-that-he-will-pay-the-outstanding-balance-in-gold
