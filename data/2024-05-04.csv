If not, so is there any name of Allah which means Existing?  is مَوْجُود an urdu, persian or arabic word! If it is an arabic word so why it is not mentioned in Quran rather وَجَدَ is mentioned in Quran which means \""Found\"" but مَوْجُود is not mentioned?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe Name of Allah, Al-Qayyum, appears in verses of the Quran, including Allah\'s\xa0statement (translation of the meaning): {Allah - there is no deity except Him, the Ever-Living,\xa0the Self-Sustaining.\xa0Neither drowsiness overtakes Him nor sleep. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Who is it that can intercede with Him except by His permission? He knows what is [presently] before them and what will be after them,\xa0and they encompass not a thing of His knowledge except for what He wills. His Kursi\xa0extends over the heavens and the earth, and their preservation tires Him not. And He is the Most High,\xa0the Most Great.} (Al-Baqarah: 255),\xa0and His statement (translation of the meaning):\xa0{Alif, Lam, Mim.\xa0Allāh - there is no deity except Him, the Ever-Living, the Self-Sustaining.} (Al `Imran: 1-2), and His statement (translation of the meaning): {And [all] faces will be humbled before the Ever-Living, the Self-Sustaining.\xa0And he will have failed who carries injustice.} (Taha: 111).\nAllah has combined in these verses two of His names, Exalted and Praised be He, which are Al-Hayy (the Ever-Living) and Al-Qayyum (the Sustainer of [all] existence), ""for they encompass all the attributes of perfection. Al-Hayy is the One with perfect life, which includes all the attributes of Allah\'s Essence: such as Knowledge, Might, Power, Will, Greatness, Majesty, and other sacred\xa0attributes of His Essence.\nAl-Qayyum is the One with perfect self-subsistence and it has two meanings:\nThe first meaning: He is the One who is self-subsisting, His attributes are magnificent, and He is independent of all His creation.\nThe second meaning: He is the One by Whom the earth and the heavens and all their creatures subsist. He is the One Who brought them into existence, sustains them, and prepared them for everything that ensures their survival, rectitude, and stability.\nHe is rich beyond need of them in every way, and they are the ones in need of Him in every way.

Al-Wahidi says: ""And His (Exalted be He) statement {Al-Qayyum} Al-Qayyum linguistically\xa0is an intensive form of Al-Qa\'im (the One who stands/exists), and its pattern is Fa`yul, and its root is: Qaywum, but when the \'ya\' and \'waw\' came together, and the preceding is a sukun, they were made into a shaddah of \'ya\', and it is not permissible to be on (Fa`ul), because if it were so, it would have been Qawwman.\nIt has three dialects: Qayum, Qayyam, and Qayyim.\n... As for its meaning: Mujahid said: Al-Qayyum: the One Who stands (exists) over everything, and its interpretation: that He stands by managing the affairs of creation, in their creation and their sustenance. And Ad-Dahhak said: Al-Qayyum: the One Whose existence is perpetual.\nAbu `Ubaidah: He is the One Who does not cease. Due to the uprightness of His attribute of existence, where change is not permissible in any way.\nAnd it is said: It means the Knower of affairs, from their saying: So-and-So stands by this book, meaning: He is knowledgeable about it,"" End quote.\nAt-Tafsir Al-Basit"" (4/ 347 - 348)"".\nAt-Tibi said: ""(Al-Qayyum) .. its meaning is the One Who stands (exists) by Himself and sustains others, and this is absolutely and generally only correct for Allah, the Exalted, for His self-subsistence does not depend in any way on others, and the subsistence of everything is by Him; as the existence and continuity of things cannot be conceived except by His existence,"" End quote.\n""""Sharh Al-Mishkah"" by At-Tibi: (6/ 1803).\nAmong those who stated that the name of Allah, Al-Qayyum, conveys the meaning of existence is ""Ibn Abi Al-`Izz Al-Hanafi,"" who said (may Allah have mercy on him): ""And from it: that He is Al-Qayyum Who does not sleep, as He is uniquely free from sleep and slumber, unlike His creation, for they sleep. And in this is an indication that the negation of anthropomorphism is not meant to negate the attributes, but rather He, Exalted be He, is described with the attributes of perfection, due to the perfection of His Essence.\nSo, the Ever-Living with an everlasting life does not resemble the living with a transient life, and for this reason, the worldly life is enjoyment, amusement, and play, and indeed, the Hereafter is the true life. Thus, the worldly life is like sleep, and the life of the Hereafter is like wakefulness.\nIt is not said: So this life of the Hereafter is perfect, and it is for the creature: because we say: The Ever-Living Whose life is from the attributes of His Essence that are inherent to it, He is the One Who granted the creature that perpetual life, so it is lasting by Allah\'s making it last, not that permanence is an inherent attribute of it by itself, unlike the life of the Lord, Exalted is He. And likewise, all His other attributes, so the attributes of the Creator are as befits Him, and the attributes of the creature are as befits it.\nKnow that these two names, I mean: the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of [all] existence, are mentioned together in the Quran in three Surahs as previously mentioned, and they are among the greatest names of Allah, to the extent that it was said: They are the Greatest name, for they encompass the affirmation of the attributes of perfection in the most complete and truthful manner, and Al-Qayyum indicates the meaning of Eternality and Everlastingness that the term Al-Qadim (the Ancient) does not indicate.\nAnd it also indicates His existence by Himself, which is the meaning of His being necessarily existent.\nAl-Qayyum is more eloquent than Al-Qayyam because the \'waw\' is stronger than the \'alif\', and it implies His standing/existing\xa0by Himself, by the agreement of the interpreters and the linguists, and it is known by necessity. And does it imply His sustaining others and His standing over them? There are two opinions, the most correct of which is: that it does imply that. And it implies the permanence of His standing/existence and the perfection of His standing/existence, due to the intensification in it, for He, Exalted be He, does not fade nor does He wane, for the fading one has certainly ceased, meaning: He does not disappear, nor diminish, nor perish, nor become non-existent, rather He is the Everlasting, the Remaining, who has always been and will always be, described with the attributes of perfection. The conjunction with the Ever-Living necessitates all other attributes of perfection, and indicates their permanence and continuity, and the absence of deficiency and non-existence from them eternally and perpetually. And for this reason, His statement (translation of the meaning): {Allah - there is no deity except Him, the Ever-Living,\xa0the Self-Sustaining.} [Al-Baqarah: 255] is the greatest verse in the Quran, as it has been established in the authentic [narrations] from the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him),"" End quote.\n""Shark At-Tahawiyyah"" (1/ 90 - 91).\nSecondly:\nIt has been mentioned in several answers that it is permissible to describe Allah, the Exalted, as (Existing), and that the existence of Allah is known from the religion by necessity, and it is an attribute of Allah by the consensus of the Muslims, so it is reported about Him and (He is) described with it, but it is not one of His Beautiful Names (Al-Asma\' Al-Husna).\nShaykh Al-Islam (may Allah have mercy on him) said: ""And He, Exalted be He, is Ancient and\xa0\xa0necessarily existent, the Lord of everything and its Sovereign, He is the Creator and all else is created,"" End quote.\n""Clarification of the Confusion of the Jahmiyyah"" (1/304).\nHe also said: ""For Allah truly exists, and the servant truly exists, and this is not like that,"" End quote.\n""Majmu` Al-Fatawa"" (5/198).\nIt is a word and meaning in Arabic, as is known from the books of language, and although the phrase ""Allah\xa0Exists"" is not from the speech of the ancient Arabs, nor from their known poetry or prose; but it is common on the tongues of the scholars.\nIt is used in the context of Allah with two meanings: affirming Him, Exalted be He, and negating His non-existence, eternally and perpetually.\nAnd affirming knowledge of Him also, so whoever seeks Him, finds Him, and knows Him, Exalted be He.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/393714/allahs-name-al-qayyum-as-proof-of-his-existence
105356,How should the sick person purify himself and pray? I hope you will explain that in detail.,"['Praise be to Allah.How sick person\xa0make Wudu\n\nThe sick person has the same obligations as a healthy person with regard to purification with water from minor and major impurity, so he should do Wudu in the case of minor impurity and Ghusl in the case of major impurity .\nBefore doing Wudu, it is essential to clean oneself with water (Istinja’) or with stones or whatever takes their place, after urinating or defecating.\n\nWhen cleaning oneself with stones, it is essential to use three clean stones. It is not permissible to clean oneself with dung, bones or food, or anything that is respectable. The best is to clean oneself with stones and the like, such as tissue and so on, then to follow that with water, because the stones remove the impurity itself and the water purifies the place, so that is best.\xa0\nOne has the choice between cleaning oneself with water or with stones and the like. If he wants to limit it to just one of the two, then water is better, because it purifies the place and it removes the impurity itself and its traces, so it is more effective in cleaning. If he limits himself to stones, then three stones are sufficient if the place becomes clean after that; if that is not sufficient then he may add a fourth or a fifth, until he has cleaned the place, but it is better to stick to an odd number.\xa0\nIt is not permissible to clean oneself with the right hand, but if the left-hand is cut off, or it is broken or diseased and the like, then he may clean himself with his right hand on the basis of necessity, and there is nothing wrong with that.\xa0\n\nIf the sick person cannot do Wudu with water because he is unable to, or because he is afraid that it will make his sickness worse or delay his recovery, then he should do Tayammum . Tayammum means striking his hands on pure dust once, then wiping his face with the inside of his fingers and palms.\n\nIt is permissible to do Tayammum using anything pure on which there is dust, even if it is not the ground, such as if the dust can fly off a wall or the like, it is permissible to use it for Tayammum. If he remains in a state of purity from the first Tayammum, he may pray with it, as is the case with Wudu, even if that is several prayers, and he does not have to renew his Tayammum, because it is an alternative to water, and the alternative comes under the same ruling as the thing it replaces.\xa0\nTayammum is invalidated by everything which invalidates Wudu, and it becomes invalidated as soon as one becomes able to use water or water becomes available, if it was not available.\xa0\n\nIf the sickness is minor, and there is no fear that using water will cause harm or cause severe sickness or delay recovery or increase the pain or cause anything harmful, such as headaches, toothache and the like, or the patient can use warm water and will not be harmed by it -- in these cases it is not permissible to do Tayammum, because it is permitted in order to ward off harm, but there is no harm in these cases, and because he can find water, so he is obliged to use it.\nIf it is too difficult for the sick person to do Wudu or Tayammum himself , someone else should do Wudu or Tayammum for him, and that is acceptable.\nIf a person has wounds or ulcers or broken limbs or any sickness in which using water would harm him, and he becomes Junub, it is permissible for him to do Tayammum. If he is able to wash the sound parts of his body, he must do that and do Tayammum for the rest.\nIf a person has a wound in one of the parts of the body that are washed during Wudu, if washing it with water is too difficult for him or will harm him, he may wipe it with water instead of washing the injured part, according to the normal sequence of Wudu. If it is too difficult for him to wipe it or if doing so will harm him, he may do Tayammum for it, and that is acceptable.\nFor the one who is wearing a dressing -- which means that there is a bad break in one of his limbs and it is wrapped up or the like -- he may wipe over it with water and that is sufficient, even if he was not in a state of purity when he put it on.\nWhen the sick person wants to pray, he must strive to make sure that his body, clothes and the place where he wants to pray are free of impurities, but if he cannot do that, he should pray as he is, and there is no blame on him.\nIf the sick person is affected by urinary incontinence and has not recovered with treatment, then he must clean himself (Istinja’) and do Wudu for every prayer after the time for it begins, and he must wash off whatever has got onto his body or clothes, or put on clean clothes for prayer if it is not too difficult for him to do so, otherwise he is pardoned, but he should take precautions to prevent the spread of urine on his clothes or body or the place of his prayer, by putting a cloth over the head of the penis.\n\nHow sick people offer prayer\n\nThe sick person must pray standing as much as he can.\nIf he cannot stand, then he may pray sitting, but it is better for him to sit cross-legged at the times when one normally stands during prayer.\nIf he is unable to pray sitting, he may pray lying on his side facing towards the Qiblah. It is recommended for him to lie on his right side.\nIf he is unable to pray on his side, he may pray lying on his back with his feet towards the Qiblah.\n\n\nIf a person is able to stand but he is unable to bow or prostrate, then standing is not waived in his case; rather he should pray standing, and lean forward for rukoo’, then sit and lean forward for sujood.\nIf there is some sickness in his eye, and a trustworthy doctor has told him, “if you pray lying on your back then it will heal, otherwise it will not,” then he may pray lying on his back.\nIf he is unable to bow and prostrate, he may lean forward for them, and he should lean lower for prostration than for bowing.\nIf he is unable to prostrate only, then he should bow and lean forward for prostration.\nIf he cannot bend his back, he should bend his neck, and if his back is bent so that it is as if he is bowing, then when he wants to bow he should lean forward a little, and make his face as near to the ground as he can when prostrating.\nIf he cannot tilt his head forward, he should say takbeer and recite Quran, and intend in his heart the standing, bowing, rising, prostration, rising, sitting between the two prostrations and sitting to recite the tashahhud, and he should recite all the prescribed Adhkar. As for what some sick people do of gesturing with the finger, there is no basis for it.\nIf the sick person becomes able, during his prayer, to do something that he was unable to do, such as standing, sitting, bowing, prostrating or leaning forward, he should start to do that and continue from what he has already done of his prayer.\nIf the sick person or anyone else sleeps and misses a prayer, or he forgets it, he must pray it when he wakes up from his sleep or when he remembers it, and it is not permissible for him to leave it until the time for the same prayer begins (the next day) and then pray it.\nIt is not permissible to stop praying under any circumstances, rather the accountable person must be keen to pray in all circumstances, whether he is healthy or sick, because it is the pillar of the faith and the most important obligation after the twin testimony of faith. So it is not permissible for the Muslim to fail to offer an obligatory prayer until the time for it has ended, even if he is sick, so long as he is of sound mind. Rather he must offer it at the proper time according to what he is able to do on the basis of the details mentioned above. As for what some sick people do of delaying prayers until they recover from their sickness , this is something that is not permitted and there is no basis for it in sharee’ah.\nIf it is too hard for the sick person to offer every prayer on time, then he may join Dhuhr and `Asr , and Maghrib and `Isha’, at the time of the earlier or later prayer, according to what is easy for him. If he wishes he may join `Asr with Dhuhr at the time of Dhuhr, or if he wishes he may delay Dhuhr and join it with `Asr; if he wishes he may join `Isha’ with Maghrib at the time of Maghrib, or he may delay Maghrib and join it with `Isha’.\n\nAs for Fajr, it cannot be joined with the prayer before it or after it, because its time is separate from the times of the prayers that come before and after it.\xa0\n(Shaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn `Abd-Allah ibn Baz, Shaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz Aal Ash-Shaykh, Shaykh `Abdullah ibn Ghadyan, Shaykh Salih Al-Fawzan, Shaykh Bakr Abu Zayd)']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/105356/can-i-pray-without-wudu-if-im-sick
13436,I would like to know. Due to masturbation I broke my hymen. Does this makes me a zaniya. Do i have to be punished with hundred lashes or is there any other punishment for this in our religion. And if there is please let me know and I also want to know can I marry a chaste person after indulging in masturbation so many times. Please answer in accordance with Quran and Sunnah.,"['Praise be to Allah.Is masturbation prohibited?\nThe masturbation is prohibited , as we have explained in the answer to question no.\xa0329 . You have to repent from this action and give it up , and regret what you have done , and resolve not to go back to it.\xa0\nThere are many punishments for the sinner in this world, let alone the punishment that he deserves in the Hereafter. We have already mentioned some of these punishments in the answer to question no.\xa023425 .\xa0\nSo hasten to repent sincerely before you are no longer able to do so, and before you feel regret at the time when regret will be to no avail.\xa0\nIf Allah honours you by enabling you to repent, you will be forgiven for this sin, and it will be as if it never happened. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The one who repents is like the one who did not sin.” (Narrated by Ibn Majah; classed as good by Al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah, 3427)\xa0\nPunishment for Masturbation in Islam\nBreaking the hymen as a result of masturbation is not Zina, and no Hadd (fixed prescribed punishment) or expiation is required.\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about masturbation and he replied:\xa0\nWith regard to masturbation, the basic ruling is that it is prohibited according to the majority of scholars, and the one who does it should be given a Ta`zir punishment (punishments that are not fixed in Islam and are decided by the ruler), but it is not like Zina. And Allah knows best.” (Al-Fatawa Al-Kubra, 3/439)\xa0\nIf it is obvious that the hymen has been broken as a result of masturbation, then you have to tell your fiancé what happened to you, without giving any details that may cause you embarrassment. It is sufficient for him to know that this happened without any fornication, because the hymen may be broken because of exercise, being beaten, falling or being sick.\xa0\nYou will never be exposed if you repent to Allah and are sincere in your repentance, for Allah is the Concealer and loves concealment.\nFor more details, please refer to the following answers: 37673 , 127290 , 826 , and 2571 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13436/punishment-for-masturbation-in-islam
388957,"when the quran states that mankind and jinn cannot bring something like the Quran for even 3 verses, what is the explanation for Surah Jinn which quotes Jinn for 15 verses?","['Praise be to Allah.The Quran is the Speech of Allah, spoken by Him with His letters and meanings, as He, the Exalted, said (translation of the meaning): {And if any one of the polytheists seeks your protection, then grant him protection so that he may hear the Words of Allāh [i.e., the Quran]. Then deliver him to his place of safety. That is because they are a people who do not know.}\xa0(At-Tawbah:6).\nIn the Quran, there are statements of various peoples that Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, has mentioned, including the believers like the prophets and the truthful, and the disbelievers, like Pharaoh and Qarun, and the hypocrites, as well as the angels, the jinn, the birds like the hoopoe, the ants, and others.\nThe purpose of mentioning these statements is to convey the meaning and not necessarily the exact wording. Sometimes the conveyed message is the exact wording, and sometimes it is the meaning, especially if it is impossible for it to be the exact wording, such as when the speaker is not speaking in Arabic. This has been explicitly stated by more than one of the scholars:\nZain Ad-Din Ar-Razi Al-Hanafi said in ""Questions and Answers on the Oddities of the Verses of Revelation"" (p. 144): ""If it is asked: How did Allah, the Exalted, narrate here the speech of the sorcerers who believed and of Pharaoh (translation of the meaning): {They said, \'We believe in the Lord of the worlds\'} to the saying of Allah: {And cause us to die as Muslims}, then narrated this meaning in Surah Taha and Surah Ash-Shu`ara with additions and omissions in the words attributed to them, when this event only occurred once, so how did their expression differ in it?\nWe say: The answer to this is that they spoke in their language, not in Arabic, and Allah, the Exalted, narrated that from them in Arabic several times, for a wisdom that necessitated repetition and reiteration, which we will explain in Surah Ash-Shu`ara, Allah willing. So, at one time He narrated it matching their wording in the translation, taking care of the wording, and after that, He narrated it by meaning, following the custom of the Arabs in varying speech and differing in their styles; so as not to bore if it was merely repetitive."" End quote.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in ""At-Tis`iniyyah"" (2/464): ""Indeed, the letters and sounds that Moses heard were Hebrew, and those that Allah mentioned about him in the Quran were Arabic. If speech were merely letters and sounds, there would be no commonality at all between the speech that Moses heard and that which Allah mentioned that he heard. Thus, reporting that he heard these sounds, which he did not hear, would be a lie.\nLikewise, all those whom Allah narrated in the Quran that they spoke from the previous nations who spoke languages other than Arabic, they spoke in their languages, and Allah narrated that in the language in which the Quran was revealed, which is Arabic. And the Speech of Allah is truth. If their speech was just letters and sounds, and the letters and sounds they said are not like these, then it would not be possible to narrate from them at all. Rather, their speech was letters and meanings, so Allah narrated that from them in another language, and the letters follow the meanings, and the meanings are the main intended purpose, as the speech of all creatures is translated."" End quote.\nAt-Tahir said: ""The meaning of the statement here is: to convey their intention to those they want to reach among their kind, in the manner in which they understand each other,"" At-Tahrir wat-Tanwir (29/220).\nAnd he said: ""This is narrated from the speech of the jinn,"" At-Tahrir wat-Tanwir (29/222).\nIn summary, what this ignorant objector mentioned only demonstrates his ignorance, narrow-mindedness, and poor understanding.\nIf Allah\'s narration of the speech of the jinn or humans, whether believers or disbelievers, in His Book, meant that those whom Allah narrated from them said ""Quran,"" then that would mean that all these humans, and the jinn, had brought forth a Quran from themselves, and then Allah transmitted this Quran in ""His Quran""; then He challenged them to produce something like it.\nThis could not be from the weakest of people in intellect; rather, it is only imagined and found problematic by someone who is ignorant, who does not know the places of argument, and the aspects of speech.\nAnd it is astonishing that anyone would believe such nonsense, be disturbed by it, and think there is a real problem!!\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/388957/quranic-challenge-to-the-jinn
212022,“Part of honoring the deceased is to bury him”– does the word deceased include even animals because I buried an animal of mine when I heard this Hadith?,"['Praise be to Allah.Is ‘Honouring the deceased means burying him’ a Hadith?\n“Honouring the deceased means burying him” is not a Hadith; rather these are the words of one of the jurists. (See Mukhtasar Khalil by Al-Kharashi, 2/91)\xa0\nAs-Sakhkhawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Maqasid Al-Hasanah (p. 141):\xa0\n“I did not find the Hadith “Honouring the deceased means burying him ” in any report attributed to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Rather it was narrated by Ibn Abu Ad-Dunya in his Kitab Al-Mawt, via Ayyub As-Sakhtiyani. He said: ‘It was said that a sign of honouring the deceased on the part of his family is their hastening to bury him.’”\xa0\nBut the meaning is correct and is in accordance with the Sunnah.\xa0\nShould animals be buried when they die?\nWe do not say concerning an animal, when it dies, that part of honouring it is burying it, as we say about human beings. But if burying an animal will ward off harm from the Muslims, then it is prescribed to do so, because burying it in that case comes under the heading of removing something harmful from the road used by the Muslims.\xa0\nIf the Muslims will be harmed by an animal when it dies and bothered by its smell, then it is obligatory to bury it or take it far away from the highways and byways used by the people. Hence it is prescribed to bury it, in order to ward off harm from the Muslims, not just because it has died.\xa0\nAl-Bukhari (1492) and Muslim (363) narrated that Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: A sheep was given in charity to a freed slave woman of Maymunah, but it died. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) passed by it and said: “Why don’t you take its hide and tan it, and make use of it?” They said: It is dead, O Messenger of Allah (i.e., it died of natural causes and was not slaughtered properly). He said: “It is only prohibited to eat it.”\xa0\nSo he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) encouraged them to make use of its hide, and he did not tell them to bury it.\xa0\nThe scholars of the Standing Committee were asked about vermin and animals and so on; should they be buried, or left unburied on the ground?\xa0\nThey replied:\xa0\n“The matter is broad in scope, because there is no text in Shari`ah to indicate that it is prescribed to bury them or to forbid doing so. But it is preferable to bury them so that they will not harm or bother anyone.” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 8/444-445)\xa0\nFor more details, please refer to the following answers: 11437 , 14404 , 146155 , and 119652 .\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/212022/should-animals-be-buried-when-they-die
