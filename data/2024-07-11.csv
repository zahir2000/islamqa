292782,"I read that hydrogenated oils are detrimental to human health, and they are found in many foods. What is the ruling on eating these foods, if it is proven that they are detrimental to health?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nHydrogenation is a chemical process in which hydrogen is added to another substance.\nThis refers to a substance the molecules of which contain particles of hydrogen, but it can absorb more particles thereof, so it is called unsaturated.""(Al-Mawsu‘ah al-‘Arabiyyah al-‘Alamiyyah).\nHydrogenation of oils refers to a process by means of which liquid oils that are found in plants and various foods are transformed into solid fats by the addition of hydrogen.\nFresh, natural plant oils are heated in large containers until they reach a temperature of 400°C, then hydrogen gas is pumped into them under high pressure, until the unsaturated oils become saturated with particles of hydrogen gas. Other metal elements, such as aluminum and nickel, are added to speed up the process (catalysts).\nCompanies like to produce hydrogenated oils for a number of reasons, which are all aimed at increasing profits:\n1. Extending the shelf life of goods, as\xa0hydrogenation is a process that preserves food.\n2. Making food more palatable.\n3. Increasing profits by selling more goods and reducing waste.\nGlobal health agencies have warned against excessive consumption of this type of oil, because it has long-term impacts on health if it is consumed excessively.\nThe harm that it leads to includes:\n\nObesity\nRaising levels of bad cholesterol (low-density lipoprotein (LDL))\nHardening of the arteries (arteriosclerosis) and heart disease\nDigestive problems\nDegenerative diseases\n\nHydrogenated oils are found in many processed foods, including the following:\n\nFats and margarines\nFrozen vegetables\nCanned foods\nBaked goods and starchy foods\nReady-made pastries\nFried foods\nSynthetic milk or nondairy coffee creamer\n\nSecondly:\nThe basic principle is that life is to be protected and it is haram to consume anything that is clearly harmful or most likely to cause harm, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And do not kill yourselves [or one another]}\xa0[An-Nisa’ 4:29].\nAnd the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There should be neither harm nor reciprocating harm.” Narrated by Ahmad, Ibn Majah (2341); classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah.\nSo if it is proven that some food will clearly or most likely cause immediate harm, it is haram to consume the amount that will lead to such harm.\nBut these oils are used in a certain ratio that varies from one type of food to another, and the harm does not appear immediately. Perhaps many people consume them but are not harmed, because they exercise or burn it off by means of physical activity. Hence we have not come across anyone who forbids consuming foods that contain these oils. But they should be avoided as much as possible, and there are sufficient beneficial and permissible foods so that we have no need of those foods.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/292782/is-it-haram-to-eat-foods-containing-hydrogenated-oils
42574,One of my neighbours told me that the Qiblah towards which I was praying was wrong and was not in accordance with the Qiblah of the neighbouring mosque.,"['Praise be to Allah.Facing the Qiblah in prayer: Essential?\nFacing the Qiblah is one of the conditions of prayer being valid . Every worshipper has to make sure he faces the Qiblah in his prayer, and strive to make sure he is facing in the right direction, whether by means of natural signs or using a compass , if he is able to do that, or by asking trustworthy people in that place who know in which direction the Qiblah is.\xa0\nWhat happens if you pray in the wrong direction?\nIt seems most likely in the case that you describe that the deviation from the Qiblah was very slight. This slight deviation is something that can happen when a person who lives in that area is a little confused and people do not pay attention to this slight difference in direction .\xa0\nIf that is the case, i.e., if the deviation from the Qiblah was slight, then it does not matter and it does not invalidate the prayer, because those who are far away from the Ka`bah have to face in its general direction; they do not have to face precisely in that direction.\xa0\nAt-Tirmidhi (342) and Ibn Majah (1011) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whatever is between the east and the west is the Qiblah.” (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Al-Irwa’)\xa0\nAs-San`ani (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Subul As-Salam (1/260). This hadith indicates that what is required is to face in that direction, and not towards the precise location of the Ka`bah when one cannot see it.\xa0\nFurther evidence to this effect is to be seen in the report narrated by Al-Bukhari (144) and Muslim (264) from Abu Ayyub (may Allah be pleased with him) who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If you need to relieve yourself, then do not face the Qiblah or turn your back towards it, whether you are urinating or defecating, rather face to the east or to the west.”\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Sharh Al-`Umdah:\xa0\n“This is stating that facing any direction other than the east or the west means that one is either facing the Qiblah or turning one’s back towards it. This was addressed to the people of Madinah and everyone who was in the same direction (in relation to Makkah), because this was the consensus of the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them). `\nUmar said: Whatever is between the east and the west is the Qiblah except at the House.\xa0 And it was narrated that `Uthman (may Allah be pleased with him) said: How can a man make a mistake in his prayer when whatever is between the east and the west is the Qiblah, so long he does not turn towards the east deliberately.\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Thus we know that the matter is broad in scope. So if we see a person praying in a direction that is slightly off from the Qiblah, that does not matter, because he is facing in its general direction, and this is what he is obliged to do.” (Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti`, 2/273)\nBut if the deviation from the direction of the Qiblah was very great , so that you were not praying in the direction of the Qiblah at all, such as if you were praying towards the east when the Qiblah is towards the west or the north, for example, so long as you based your action on the words of someone who you know attaches great importance to the prayer and you thought that they knew better about the direction of the Qiblah, then you do not have to do anything, and the prayers which you offered are still valid, even if you faced the wrong direction when you prayed, because if a person tries his best to get it right, he has done what is required of him, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“So keep your duty to Allah and fear Him as much as you can.”\xa0[At-Taghabun 64:16]\nIt says in Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah (6/314): “If a worshipper does his best to figure out the direction of the Qiblah and prays, then he finds out that he was mistaken, his prayer is still valid.”\xa0\nIn Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) (10/421) it says:\xa0\n“If a believer does his best to figure out the direction of the Qiblah, when he is in the desert or is in a city in which he is not sure where the Qiblah is, and he prays on that basis, then he finds out that he prayed in a direction other than the Qiblah, then he should continue to pray according to his latest estimate, if he believes that it is more correct than his first estimate. His first prayer is still valid because he did his best to work out the Qiblah.”\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/42574/accidentally-prayed-in-the-wrong-direction
438695,"What is the ruling on using a hosepipe in which some dead mice were found, and the smell still remains after cleaning it?","['Praise be to Allah.If the mice died in the hosepipe, and something came out of them, or any part of them disintegrated, then the hosepipe has become impure (najis). If it is washed with pure water, or liquid other than water – according to the scholarly view that liquids other than water are sufficient to remove impurity – in such a way that there is no trace of the impurity left, such as taste, colour or smell, then it becomes pure (tahir).\nIf it is difficult to remove the smell after washing the hosepipe thoroughly and removing the substance of the impurity, then it is deemed to be pure.\nIs it necessary to remove the smell by using something other than water, such as detergents?\nThere is a difference of scholarly opinion regarding that.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Majmu‘ (2/594): If the smell alone remains and is difficult to remove, such as the smell of wine, the urine of a person affected by birsam [a kind of tumour] and some types of excrement.\nThere are two views, the more sound of which is that it becomes pure…\nIf the colour and the smell remain, then it does not become pure, according to the correct view, but ar-Rafa‘i narrated a different view concerning it.\nThe author of al-Tatimmah said: If the impurity cannot be removed with water only, but it can be removed by using potash and the like, that must be done.\nMoreover, whatever we deem to have been purified in this manner, even if the colour or smell remains, is pure in a real sense. This is the correct view which is held by the majority.\nAnother view is also mentioned in at-Tatimmah, which is that it is still impure, but it may be overlooked, and there is nothing to worry about. End quote.\nAl-Hattab said in Mawahib al-Jalil (1/163), in a comment on the view of Khalil: Once the taste has gone away, it does not matter if any colour or smell remains, if it is difficult to remove them.\nIf the taste remains, then the impurity has not been removed, because the fact that the taste remains indicates that the impurity is still present. Therefore the taste must be removed, even if it is difficult.\nIn other words, the place where the impurity was becomes pure thereby, provided that the taste of the impurity is removed. It is not stipulated that the colour or smell should be removed, if that is too difficult. But if it is not too difficult to remove them, that place does not become pure if either of them remains.\nIf the colour remains, that is more serious than if the smell remains.\nIt says in al-Jawahir: If the taste remains after the substance has disappeared, as seen by the naked eye, then that place is still impure, because the fact that the taste is still there indicates that the impurity is still there.\nThe same ruling applies if the colour or smell remains and it can be removed with water.\nBut if it is difficult to remove it, it may be overlooked, and the place is deemed to be pure.\nHe narrated it in adh-Dhakhirah and added: The smell may also be overlooked in the case of cleaning oneself after relieving oneself (istinja’), if it is too difficult to remove it from the hand or from the place.\nNote…\n-2- What matters with regard to removing it is removing it with water, as may be understood from the words quoted above from al-Jawahir, and it is easy to remove it with water. What may be understood from this is that if it is possible to remove the colour or smell with something other than water, that is not obligatory, and this is indeed the case. Ibn al-‘Arabi and Ibn al-Haajib also said something similar.\nIf it is possible to remove the colour and smell with potash or soap, then what appears to be the case is that it is not obligatory. Ash-Shafa‘i had a different opinion regarding that.\nIn the hadith of Khawlah bint Yasar regarding blood that is difficult to remove it says: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Water is sufficient for you, and it does not matter if its trace remains.” Narrated by Ahmad and Abu Dawud.\nSmell may be regarded as being like colour, when it is difficult to remove either. End quote.\nIt says in Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah (6/210): If you washed the impurity that is on your clothes or body, and removed its substance, then you prayed, your prayer is valid, and so is the prayer of those who prayed behind you. It does not matter if any of its smell remains, so long as the substance of the impurity has disappeared.\nShaykh ‘Abdullah ibn Ghadyan, Shaykh ‘Abd ar-Razzaq ‘Afifi, Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn ‘Abdillah ibn Baz.

108860,"I am a young woman who is about to get married, but I suffer from the problem of having a small chest. Is it permissible for me to use creams that help to enlarge the breasts?","['Praise be to Allah.Ruling on breast implants in Islam\nIf the aim in enlarging the breasts is to increase beauty, that is not permissible, because it is changing the creation of Allah. If the breasts are so small as to cause you embarrassment and distress, then there is nothing wrong with enlarging them in ways that will not cause you harm, such as using creams and so on.\xa0\nTreating that with creams is easier than having surgery which involves anaesthesia or uncovering the `Awrah in the event that there is no specialised female doctor available.\xa0\nThe balance between beautification and removing faults\nWhat we have mentioned about differentiating between beautification and removing faults is the general guideline with regard to cosmetic procedures. Please see the answer to question no.\xa047694 .\xa0\nThere follow some of the comments of scholars on this issue:\xa0\nThe scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas were asked:\xa0\nI am a young man, eighteen years old. Four years ago my breast became prominent and that was accompanied by some pain. After a while, the pain went away, praise be to Allah, but the prominence remained. This prominence of my breast is obvious even under clothing. I asked the specialist about that and he said that this can easily be removed by means of cosmetic surgery . Is it permissible to have this surgery? Please note that this problem causes me embarrassment in front of other people.\xa0\nThey replied:\xa0\n“It is permissible for you to have cosmetic surgery to remove this prominence if it is thought most likely that the surgery will be successful and that the harms will not outweigh or be equal to the benefits.\xa0\nAnd Allah is the Source of strength. May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.” (`Abd Al-`Aziz ibn `Abdullah ibn Baz, `Abd Ar-Razzaq `Afifi, `Abdullah ibn Ghadyan, `Abdullah ibn Qa`ud, Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 25/62)\xa0\nThey were also asked (25/59): one of my colleagues had gotten married, praise be to Allah, but he came to me and said that his wife wants to have cosmetic surgery on her face and breasts, because her nose is large and wide, and she wants to reduce it by means of the easy methods that modern science has developed. Is there any doubt about this surgery or is there any sin involved? Please note that not doing it may lead to psychological distress because this fault appears so prominently on her face.\xa0\nThey replied:\n“If the situation is as described, and there is the hope that the surgery will be successful and will not lead to a greater or equal harm, then it is permissible to do it in order to achieve the desired purpose, otherwise it is not permissible.\xa0\nAnd Allah is the Source of strength. May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.” (`Abd Al-`Aziz ibn `Abdullah ibn Baz, `Abd Ar-Razzaq `Afifi, `Abdullah ibn Ghadyan, `Abdullah ibn Qa`ud)\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about some cosmetic procedures such as straightening the nose, liposuction, breast reduction or enhancement, and so on – what is the ruling on these procedures? What are the guidelines, may Allah bless and reward you and benefit others through you.\xa0\nHe replied:\xa0\n“With regard to the beautification that you mentioned, beautification is of two types. The first type is done to remove faults and the second type is done to increase beauty. The first type – removing faults – is permissible; if a person’s nose is bent, it is permissible for him to have surgery to straighten it, because this is removing a fault. The nose is not normal, rather it is bent, so he wants to straighten it. The same applies to a man who has a squint; this is undoubtedly a fault, so if he wants to have surgery to correct the fault, it is permissible and there is no reason why he should not, because this is removing a fault. If a man’s nose is cut off due to an accident, can he have a prosthetic nose installed?\xa0 An incident of this type occurred at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The nose of one of the Companions was cut off in battle and the man had a nose of silver made, but the silver tarnished and developed an unpleasant smell, so the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) gave him permission to have a nose made of gold, so he did that. Hence we say: is it for beautification or to remove a fault? Removing a fault is permissible. The same applies if the lip is cleft (harelip); it is permissible to join the two sides because this is removing a fault.\xa0\nWith regard to the second type, which is increasing beauty, this is what is not permissible. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed women who file their teeth for beauty, i.e., they file them and make gaps between them for the purpose of beautification. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed that, and he cursed women who put on hair extensions by adding hair to their short hair and so on.\xa0\nIt remains for us to examine whether an operation to enhance or reduce the breast is permissible or not. This is a kind of beautification, unless the woman who has small breasts wants to increase them so that they can hold more milk, i.e., if her breast is too small\xa0 and cannot hold enough milk to satisfy for her child. In that case we may say that there is nothing wrong with it. But for the purpose of beautification it is not permissible. This is the guideline with regard to cosmetic surgery. Cosmetic surgery is of two types: the first is removing faults and there is nothing wrong with that; the second is increasing beauty and that is not permissible.” (Al-Liqa’ Ash-Shahri, 50/8)\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/108860/are-breast-implants-prohibited-in-islam
