111930,"I am pregnant, and I ask Allah to bless me with a righteous child. I would like to know whether there are any righteous deeds that I can do when I am pregnant?","['Praise be to Allah.Perhaps the most important righteous deed that a pregnant woman can do and pay attention to is learning useful methods of raising children, reading trustworthy books about child-rearing, and listening to specialist people of knowledge who are known to be sincere. That is because giving a child a good upbringing is the most important duty that parents can do for their children, and it cannot be matched by accumulating wealth, buying what they need or anything else, to the extent that a wise person said:\nThe best thing that parents can leave for their children is a praiseworthy attitude, good manners and righteous friends.\nThis was quoted by Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr in Bahjat al-Majalis (p. 18). Something similar was also narrated in a mursal hadith. See: al-Silsilah al-Da‘ifah (no. 1121).\nNo one should think that instilling good manners and a good attitude is something easy; rather this refers to a set of manners and attitudes that a person cannot attain except through experience, care and discipline. If the parents rely on the child learning about good manners and good attitudes by himself, then they are being careless and negligent towards their children.\nAl-Mawardi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nYou should understand that the child is born with some characteristics and manners, so the praiseworthy and pleasing characteristics need to be polished and refined, because the praiseworthy characteristics have opposites which could be strengthened through whims and desires. If the parent fails to discipline the child and leaves the development of manners and attitudes to the child’s reason, in the hope that he will naturally adhere to good characteristics and manners, and he gives up striving, he will end up a remorseful loser and the child will grow up with no manners or discipline, behaving like ignorant people. That is because good manners are acquired through experience or learned from customs that are regarded as good, and each community will vary in that regard. That is not something that can be attained through reason or letting the child behave according to his nature so that he can learn through experience and pain. And it cannot be learned through experience in dealing with others, then letting the child’s reason decide about these issues. If reason were sufficient to learn about good manners and attitudes, then the Prophets of Allah, may He be exalted, would have had no need for revealed texts, and it would have been sufficient for them to rely on their reason. It was narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that he said: “I have been sent to perfect noble characteristics.”(Adab al-Dunya wa’l-Din\xa0 p. 286).\nThat – undoubtedly – is what is referred to in the verse in which Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{O you who have believed, protect yourselves and your families from a Fire whose fuel is people and stones}[Al-Tahrim 66:6].\nIf parents had sufficient awareness of this matter, and they realised how serious the issue of raising a child, disciplining him and teaching him good manners is, the entire condition of the ummah could be changed completely and would become better and more sound, by Allah’s leave.\nWe also advise the pregnant woman to adhere to religious duties, uphold regular prayer, and offer a great deal of supplication, asking Allah, may He be exalted, for a righteous child who honours his parents and for well-being in this world and the hereafter, for no one is ever given anything better than well-being. We do not know of any particular act of worship that is recommended in Islamic teachings specifically for the pregnant woman and not for others.\nYou can learn a lot from the book Mas’uliyat al-Ab al-Muslim nahwa al-Walad fi Marhalat al-Tufulah by ‘Adnan Salih Baharith.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/111930/are-there-righteous-deeds-that-a-pregnant-woman-in-particular-can-do
231261,"I am living here in the West. I was wondering what is the extent that [something is pure until proven that it is prohibited] with respect to food, clothing and soap?","['Praise be to Allah.Everything Is Permissible in Islam Until Proven Prohibited\nThe scholars set a rule that says that in principle everything is permissible, and they based this rule on Shar`i evidence.\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“It should be understood that in principle all things, of various types and categories, are generally permissible for human beings, and that they are pure and it is not forbidden for people to handle them and touch them. This is a comprehensive rule that is general in application, and it is an important ruling that is of immense benefit and brings much blessing, and the scholars turned to it when issuing ruling on innumerable actions and issues faced by people. It is based on ten points of evidence – from what I can call to mind of sources of shari‘ah – namely: the Book of Allah, the Sunnah of His Messenger, and following the path of the believers that is mentioned in the verses (interpretation of the meaning): “Obey Allah and obey the Messenger (Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)), and those of you (Muslims) who are in authority” [An-Nisa’ 4:59] and “Verily, your Walee (Protector or Helper) is Allah, His Messenger, and the believers” [Al-Ma’idah 5:55]; in addition to analogy, giving the same rulings to similars situations, rational thinking, and insight.” (Majmu‘ Al-Fatawa, 21/535)\xa0\nThen he (may Allah have mercy on him) quoted the evidence for that, so please refer to the book mentioned above.\nWhat this ruling means is that with regard to everything that is of benefit on earth, and what man may attain thereof and make use of, is permissible so long as there is no evidence to indicate that it is prohibited.\nPermissible and prohibited food and drinks\nWith regard to food , drink, clothing and soap (and cleaning materials), this rule is to be followed with regard to everything except in the presence of Shar`i text that gives a ruling about a certain matter or situation, with the exception of the following:\n\nThings containing any considerably harmful ingredients, because the basic principle with regard to harmful substances is that they are prohibited, and they are not included in the rule that says: “in principle everything is permissible”.\n\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“and do not throw yourselves into destruction.”\xa0[Al-Baqarah 2:195]\n“And do not kill yourselves (nor kill one another). Surely, Allah is Most Merciful to you.”\xa0[An-Nisa’ 4:29]\nAbu Sa‘id Al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There should be neither harming nor reciprocating harm.” Narrated by Al-Hakim (2/57-58). He said: Its chain of narrators is authentic according to the conditions of Muslim. It was also classed as authentic by Al-Albaani in Silsilat Al-Ahaadeeth As-Saheehah (1/498)\nShaykh Muhammad Al-Amin Ash-Shanqiti (may Allah have mercy on him) discussed this issue and said:\n“If it is purely harmful with no benefit at all, then it is prohibited, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There should be neither harming nor reciprocating harm.”\nIf it is beneficial in some ways and harmful in others, then one of three scenarios must apply:\n\nEither the benefit outweighs the harm\nor the converse is true\nor the benefit and harm are equal.\n\nIf the harm outweighs the benefit or is equal to it, then it is not allowed, because of the Hadith, “There should be neither harming nor reciprocating harm,” and because warding off harm takes precedence over achieving interests.\nIf the benefit outweighs the harm, then the most correct view is that it is permissible, because it is a well-established principle that greater benefits take precedence over lesser harms.” (Adwa’ Al-Bayan, 7/793-794)\n\nThe basic principle with regard to meat is that it is prohibited.\n\nThat is because it is not permissible to eat meat unless it is slaughtered in the proper (Islamic) manner, fulfilling all the necessary conditions.\nAl-Khataabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“With regard to anything that is prohibited in principle, it only becomes permissible if it fulfils the necessary conditions and is done in the proper manner, such as intimate relationships, which do not become permissible until after marriage.\xa0\nSimilarly, the meat of sheep does not become permissible unless it is slaughtered in the proper manner. If there is any doubt concerning the fulfilment of these conditions, and whether they were met for certain in the manner that indicates that it has become permissible, then the original principle remains in effect and the meat is prohibited.” (Ma‘alim As-Sunan, 3/57)\nHowever, in order to prove that it is permissible, it is sufficient to know that the one who slaughtered it was a Muslim or one of the People of the Book (a Jew or Christian). After that it is not necessary to ascertain the method of slaughter for each animal.\nBased on that, with regard to meat that is available in a Muslim or Christian country, it is deemed to be permissible, unless it is proven that it was slaughtered in a way that is contrary to Islamic rulings, such as strangling or electric shock, or that the name of Allah was not mentioned over it, and so on.\nWith regard to products for which there is no Shar`i evidence that they are prohibited, or the list of ingredients does not include any components that are prohibited or are harmful, then we rule that it is permissible and pure, and that basic principle is not altered for mere doubts or unproven talk.\nYet, if prohibited ingredients are included in some food , is it prohibited to consume it altogether? This is subject to further detailed discussion, as has been explained in fatwa no.\xa0114129 .\nTo sum up, if the prohibited substance is still present in its original form, then it is prohibited to consume it. However, if it has been transformed into another substance by means of interactions or manufacturing processes, and the first prohibited substance is no longer present in its original form, then the more correct scholarly view is that it is permissible to consume it.\nPermissible and prohibited clothing\xa0\nWith regard to clothing, it comes under the rule that “in principle everything is permissible”. The basic principle concerning it is that it is permissible, except what is excluded by Islamic rulings, such as silk which is prohibited for men, and some animal skins that cannot be purified by means of tanning.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/231261/everything-is-permissible-in-islam-until-proven-prohibited
119722,"How sound is the nasheed that is attributed to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), “Tala‘a al-Badru ‘alayna”, and is it permissible to sing it?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe singing of this nasheed, of which the meanings are sound, is mentioned in the books of Sirah (the Prophet’s biography) and in some books of hadith. As for the report that refers to that, it is what was narrated by ‘Ubaydullah ibn Muhammad ibn ‘A’ishah (d. 228 AH – may Allah have mercy on him), who said:\nWhen the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came to Madinah, the women, boys and young girls started to sing:\n“Tala‘a al-badru ‘alayna, min thaniyyat al-wada‘\nWajaba ash-shukru ‘alayna, ma da‘a Lillahi da‘.\n(The full moon has risen upon us, from Thaniyyat al-Wada‘ (lit. the mountain pass of farewell).\nWe must give thanks, every time the caller calls to Allah).”\nThis was narrated by Abu’l-Hasan al-Khala‘i in al-Fawa’id (2/59), and al-Bayhaqi in Dala’il al-Nubuwwah (no. 752, 2019). In Fath al-Bari (7/261), al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar attributed it to Abu Sa‘id in Sharaf al-Mustafa. All of them narrated it via the great and trustworthy scholar of hadith Abu Khalifah al-Fadl ibn al-Habbab (d. 305). See his biography in Siyar A‘lam an-Nubala’ (14/7), narrated from Ibn ‘A’ishah.\nThis is a da‘if (weak) isnad, in which there is a large interruption. Ibn ‘A’ishah died late, and he was one of the shaykhs of Imam Ahmad and Abu Dawud, so how could he narrate an incident from the life of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) without an isnad?\nHence al-Hafiz al-‘Iraqi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is a problematic report.""(Takhrij al-Ihya’\xa0 1/571).\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is a problematic isnad.""(Fath al-Bari\xa0 2/262).\nShaykh al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This is a da‘if (weak) isnad. Its narrators are trustworthy, but it is problematic because three or more narrators are missing from its isnad. That is because this Ibn ‘A’ishah is one of the shaykhs of Ahmad, and he narrated it as a mursal report… So the whole story is not proven.""(As-Silsilah ad-Da‘ifah\xa0 2/63).\nThe great scholar Ibn al-Qayyim has explained the problem with the story which says that that happened when the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came from Makkah to Madinah, as he said: There is something clearly wrong with the story, because Thaniyyat al-Wada‘ is in the direction of Syria [that is, on the northern side of Madinah] and one who is coming from Makkah to Madinah will not see it or pass through it, unless he carries on towards Syria.""(Zad al-Ma‘ad\xa0 3/551).\nHence al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Perhaps that incident happened when he came back from the campaign to Tabook.(Fath al-Bari\xa0 7/262).\nBut this rejection of the story on this basis is not to be accepted, because it is well known to the narrators of this story that it happened when the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came from Makkah to Madinah, as Imam al-Bayhaqi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Our scholars mentioned this in the context of his arrival in Madinah from Makkah, and did not say that it happened when he came to Madinah through Thaniyyat al-Wada‘ on his return from Tabuk.""(Dala’il an-Nubuwwah).\nHowever, many historians have stated that Thaniyyat al-Wada‘ is in the direction of Makkah, and that there may have been a different thaniyyah, with the same name, in the direction of Syria.\nOthers stated that when the Prophet (blessings and place of Allah be upon him) entered Madinah, he passed by the houses of the Ansar, and even passed by Banu Sa‘idah, whose land was in the northern part of Madinah, near Thaniyyat al-Wada‘, so he did not enter the centre of Madinah except from that direction, until he reached the place where he halted.\nSee: Mu‘jam al-Buldan by Yaqut al-Hamawi (2/86); Tarh at-Tathrib by al-‘Iraqi (7/239-240); Subul al-Huda wa’r-Rashad by as-Salihi ash-Shami (3/277); and al-Athar al-Muqtafa li Qissat Hijrat al-Mustafa by Abu Turab az-Zahiri (p. 155-162).\nSecondly:\nThe weakness of the isnad of these lines of verse does not mean that it is not permissible to quote them, narrate the story, or sing them as a nasheed, because the meaning is sound and beautiful, and it is very famous among the Muslims. Nothing in the story is attributed to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), such that we should be strict about its isnad; rather these are the words of the Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them).\nMost of the scholars are of the view that we may be lenient and easy-going with regard to the reports of the Sirah, and stories and words of the Sahabah and Tabi‘in on which no issue of creed (‘aqidah) or rulings on halal and haram are based. It says in Sharh ‘Ilal at-Tirmidhi (1/327) by al-Hafiz Ibn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him): Sufyan ath-Thawri (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nKnowledge of what is halal and haram should only be taken from prominent figures who are well-known for their knowledge, for they know which reports are sound and which are less so. With regard to other matters, there is nothing wrong with learning them from other shaykhs.\nIbn Abi Hatim said: My father told us: ‘Abdah said:\nIt was said to Ibn al-Mubarak – when he narrated the report from a man – it was said that this man is not reliable. He said: It is fine to narrate such matters – or such things – from him.\nI said to ‘Abdah: Such as what things? He said: Matters such as manners and attitude, exhortation, or asceticism.\nIbn Ma‘in said, regarding Musa ibn ‘Uyaynah: You may accept of his reports that which could soften the heart.\nIbn ‘Uyaynah said: Do not accept reports from Baqiyah – the name of one of the reporters – that speak of Sunnah matters, but you may accept from him reports that speak of reward and so on.\nAhmad said regarding Ibn Ishaq: You may accept from him reports about military campaigns (maghazi) and the like.\nIbn Ma‘in said regarding Ziyad al-Baka’i: There is nothing wrong with accepting his reports about military campaigns, but not about anything else. End quote.\nUndoubtedly these lines of verse are among the matters in which it is most appropriate to be easy-going and lenient about narrating them.\nDr. Akram Diya’ al-‘Umari said:\nAs for stipulating conditions like those of hadith in order to verify historical reports that do not speak about matters of creed or halal and haram, that is too extreme and could lead to some serious problems, because the historical reports that were compiled by the historians among our earlier generations were not dealt with as hadiths were dealt with; rather they were lenient regarding them. If we reject their approach, then the gaps in our history would form a huge vacuum, which would lead to confusion, loss, troubles and alienation. But that does not mean that we should abandon the methods of the hadith scholars when critiquing the isnads of historical reports, for those methods are a means of finding out which of two contradictory reports is more likely to be sound. They are also the best help in deciding to accept or reject some reports that are very problematic, or odd reports that do not fit the general framework of our ummah’s history. But we should be flexible when referring to the standards, taking into consideration the fact that reports from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) are different from historical reports, and that the former were given a great deal of care and attention that enabled the scholars to prove them to be good when measured against very strict standards.(Dirasat Tarikhiyyah\xa0 p. 27).\nIn conclusion, there is nothing wrong with singing these lines of verse, enjoying them, memorising them and teaching them to children, even if they are not proven via sound (sahih) isnads. That is because, when it comes to events such as this, it is sufficient that reports of them are circulated and are very well known among knowledgeable people. Moreover there is nothing in the story to attribute these lines of verse to any particular individual among the Sahabah; rather they are attributed to the women, boys and young girls, which makes the matter more flexible.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/119722/the-nasheed-talaa-al-badru-alayna
131590,There is a man upon whom Allah has bestowed the blessing of wealth. How should he handle it? How should he put this wealth to work? How can he protect it and increase it without incurring the wrath of Allah?,"['Praise be to Allah.What Islam teaches about wealth\nWealth may be a blessing if it is used for purposes that are pleasing to Allah, and to help one obey Allah. It may be a calamity if it is used for evil purposes, or if it makes one proud and arrogant, or it distracts him from obeying and remembering Allah.\nHence there are warnings about the temptation of wealth, because it usually causes one to transgress and forget (the Bestower), and there are few who fulfill the rights due to Allah, may He be Exalted, concerning wealth.\xa0\nAllah, may He be Exalted, says, explaining that tests may come in the form of good things and blessings, just as they may come in the form of bad things and calamities (interpretation of the meaning):\n“and We shall make a trial of you with evil and with good, and to Us you will be returned”\xa0[Al-Anbiya’ 21:35]\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “By Allah, it is not poverty that I fear for you, rather what I fear for you is that worldly riches may be given to you as it was given to those who came before you, and you will compete to attain (more of) it with one another as those before competed with one another, and you will be destroyed as they were destroyed.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 4015, and Muslim, 2961)\nMuslim (2742) narrated from Abu Sa‘id Al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “This world is sweet and green, and Allah will make you successive generations therein, so beware how you act. Be at your guard regarding this world and be at your guard regarding women, for the first trial among the Children of Israel had to do with women.”\nWhoever, Allah, may He be Exalted, enables to earn wealth from permissible sources, and spends it in appropriate ways, and strives to use it in doing acts of obedience and acts that bring one closer to Allah, then in his case wealth is a blessing, and he deserves to be envied for it (in a good way), as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “How good lawful wealth is for a righteous man.” (Narrated by Ahmad (17096); classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Saheeh Al-Adab Al-Mufrad (299)\nHe (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) also said: “There is no cause for envy except in two cases: a man to whom Allah gives wealth and enables him to spend it in support of the truth, and a man to whom Allah gives knowledge and he rules based on it and teaches it.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhaari, 73, and Muslim, 816)\nHow should money be spent in Islam?\nThe ways of spending wealth in a good manner are many and include: building mosques , giving charity , sponsoring orphans , and helping the sick and needy.\xa0\nThey also include bringing happiness to one’s family, children and relatives; using it to perform Hajj and `Umrah repeatedly; establishing schools for teaching Quran memorisation and teaching knowledge; giving loans to the needy; allowing more time for debtors who are in difficulty to pay off their debts; contributing to charitable projects that will benefit the Muslims, such as constructive satellite channels, beneficial websites, and other ways of doing good, the number of which no one knows except Allah.\nWhat matters is that the donor should understand that his real wealth is that which he gives for the sake of Allah, because he will find its good consequences after he dies.\xa0\nAs for the wealth that he keeps, it is not his wealth in the true sense of the word; rather it is the wealth of his heirs. This meaning is what was narrated by Al-Bukhari (6442) from ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ood (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “For which of you is the wealth of his heir dearer to him than his own wealth?” They said: O Messenger of Allah, there is no one among us but his wealth is dearer to him. He said: “Verily his (real) wealth is that which he sends on ahead, and the wealth of his heir is that which he keeps back.”\nHow to increase your wealth in Islam\nWith regard to ways of making one’s wealth work and grow , this is a matter concerning which one should consult specialists, but we can give you some general guidelines concerning that, which include the following:\xa0\n\nAsking and enquiring about the permissibility of the transaction or investment method before starting it.\nAvoiding putting one’s wealth in Riba-based banks and not being deceived by those who issue Fatwas stating that doing so is permissible, because Riba is one of the causes of divine wrath and loss of blessings , and the one who engages in it is in a state of war with Allah and His Messenger.\nAvoiding dubious matters.\nUnderstanding the danger that ill-gotten wealth poses to oneself, one’s family and one’s offspring.\nBeing prudent and careful, and not being deceived by schemes that claim to bring quick profits, without studying and examining them.\nBeing careful to avoid wasting this blessing by entrusting it to those who should not be trusted with it.\nLooking for honesty, trustworthiness and transparency, and avoiding deceit and secrecy.\xa0\n\nThese are among the means of attaining blessing , making a profit and earning reward, as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If they [the two parties to a transaction] are honest and disclose any defects, their transaction will be blessed, but if they lie and conceal defects, the blessing of their transaction will be erased.” \xa0(Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 2097, and Muslim, 1532)\nWe ask Allah to bless your wealth, and to enable you to make it grow and use it in ways that please Him.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/131590/wealth-in-islam
