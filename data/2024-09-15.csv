157114,What is the ruling on standing at the graveside after the burial and offering supplication for the deceased?,"['Praise be to Allah.Offering supplication for the deceased after the burial is Sunnah, because of the report narrated by Abu Dawud from `Uthman ibn `Affan (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: When the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) had finished burying a deceased person, he would stand over him and say: “Pray for forgiveness for your brother, and ask that he be made steadfast, for he is being questioned now.” (Al-Albani classed it as authentic in Sahih Abu Dawud)\nAsh-Shawkani (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This hadith indicates that it is prescribed to pray for forgiveness for the deceased when the burial is finished, and to ask that he be made steadfast, because he is being questioned at that time. (End quote from Nayl Al-Awtar, 4/110).\nIbn Al-Mundhir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The majority of scholars said that offering supplication is prescribed. Al-Ajurri and others said: It is recommended to stand [at the graveside] for a short while after the burial and offer supplication for the deceased… At-Tirmidhi said: Standing at the graveside and praying for the deceased at the time of burial is an extra supplication for the deceased after offering the funeral prayer for him, because the prayer of a congregation of Muslims is like a gathering for his sake, like people who have gathered at the door of the king, interceding for him. Standing at the graveside and asking that the deceased be made steadfast is like extra support for those who want to intercede for him, for that is the time when the deceased is tested, for he is now facing the terrifying moment in the grave and the questioning of the two angels. (End quote from Hashiyat Ar-Rawd by Ibn Al-Qasim, 3/124).\nIt says in Al-Mawsu`at Al-Fiqhiyyah (4/41): Praying for forgiveness is a verbal act of worship which it is valid to do for the deceased… Following the burial, it is recommended for a group of people to stand and pray for forgiveness for the deceased, for at that moment he is being questioned by Munkar and Nakir… This was stated by the majority of jurists. (End quote)\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Offering supplication for the deceased after the burial, asking that he be made steadfast and be forgiven, is Sunnah. (End quote from Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 13/205).\nShaykh ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Standing at the graveside after the burial and offering supplication for the deceased is Sunnah, because when the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) had finished burying the deceased, he stood at the graveside and said: “Pray for forgiveness for your brother, and ask that he be made steadfast, for right now he is being questioned.” (End quote from Liqa Al-Bab Al-Maftuh, no. 118).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/157114/offering-supplication-for-the-deceased-after-the-burial-is-sunnah
141473,"I am reading Fatwa 11796 , regarding the sleeves and searched for this hadith but couldn’t find the relevant hadith. But as a contradiction, I found this hadith:","[""Praise be to Allah.Can we pray with folded sleeves?\nRolling or tucking up a garment – whether that means rolling up the sleeves and baring the arms or rolling or tucking up the hem and baring the lower legs — is all disliked according to the majority of scholars.\xa0\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“The scholars unanimously agreed that it is not permissible to pray with one's sleeves or garment rolled up and the like, or with one's hair braided or with one's hair wrapped up beneath the turban and so on. All of that is not permissible according to the consensus of the scholars, and it is disliked in the sense of being discouraged and not proper. If a person prays like that, he has done something wrong but his prayer is valid.” (End quote from Sharh Muslim, 209)\xa0\nIn Fat-h Al-Qadir (1/418), which is a Hanafi book, it says:\xa0\nIt is also disliked to pray with the sleeves rolled up, baring the forearms. End quote.\xa0\nIn Tuhfat Al-Muhtaj (2/162), which is a Shaf `i book, it says:\xa0\n“It is disliked to wrap or tie his hair or roll or tuck up his garment, such as rolling up his sleeves or tucking up his hem, even if he only did that in order to work, or he is offering the funeral prayer, because of the Hadith the soundness of which is agreed upon, “I have been commanded to prostrate on seven bones, and not to roll or tuck up my garment or hair.” The reason why that is not allowed when prostrating is that it is contrary to proper focus and humility.” (End quote)\nIn Kashshaf Al-Qina` (1/373), which is a Hanbali book, it says:\xa0\n“It is disliked to roll or tuck up one’s garment. Some of the scholars mentioned the reason for this prohibition as being that the hair and so on prostrate with a person and it is disliked to roll up the sleeves. This was stated in Al-Ri`ayah, for the mentioned reason above. If he does that – i.e., tucks up the hair and rolls up his garment and so on, because of some work that he was doing before the prayer, it is disliked for him to leave them like that, because of what is stated above, and because of the Hadith of Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which he saw `Abdullah ibn Al-Harith praying with his hair braided at the back. He stood up and undid his braid. When `Abdullah had finished praying, he came to Ibn `Abbas and said: What have you to do with my head? He said: I heard the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “The likeness of such a one is that of a person who prays when he is tied up.” (Narrated by Muslim)\nBut the Malikis only regard that as disliked in the case of one who does that for the prayer. But if that is how he was before he prayed, or he did that for the purpose of work, then it is not disliked for him. The majority of scholars — as stated above — are of the view that it is disliked in all cases.\xa0\nIn Sharh Mukhtasar Khalil by Al-Kharashi (1/250), which is a Maliki book, it says:\xa0\n“It is disliked for one who is praying to roll up his sleeves or wrap them around his arm (if they are wide), because that is a kind of distraction from proper focus (Khushu `). That applies if he did that in order to pray. But if that is how he dresses or it was for the purpose of work, then the time for prayer came and he prayed like that, then it is not disliked for him, as was stated by Ibn Yunus, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “I have been commanded to prostrate on seven parts and not to tuck up my hair or garment.” And he said that the prohibition on that only applies if one does that deliberately before praying.” (End quote from Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah, 12/34)\xa0\nExamining the Hadith of Abu Juhayfah about rolling or tucking up one’s garment\nWith regard to the Hadith mentioned in the question, which is the Hadith of Abu Juhayfah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said:\nI saw Bilal bring out an iron-tipped spear and set it up, and the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came out wearing a suit that was rolled or tucked up. He prayed two Rak`ahs, facing the spear, and I saw people and animals passing in front of the spear. This is narrated by Al-Bukhari (5768) in a chapter entitled: Rolling or tucking up one’s garment . He also narrated a longer version (376) and it was also narrated by Muslim (503).\xa0\nImam An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Rolled or tucked up means that it came to mid-calf or thereabouts, as he said in the previous report: It is as if I can see the whiteness of his shins. (End quote from Sharh Muslim, 4/220-221)\nThis Hadith does not contradict what is mentioned above, and we can answer that in many ways, such as the following:\xa0\n\nIt may be understood that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) tucked up his garment to show that it is permissible, and that does not contradict its being disliked, because it is possible that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did some things that are disliked in order to show that they do not reach the level of being prohibited; rather they are disliked only; therefore that action is not disliked in his case (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\xa0\n\n\nIt may be that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came out to his companions with his garment tucked up as it says in the Hadith, then when he wanted to pray, he let it down and got ready to pray, but the narrator did not mention that and did not mention anything to indicate that this was not so either.\xa0\n\n\nThe rolling or tucking up mentioned here does not refer to the sleeves, and it does not refer to rolling up the sleeves, as is the view of the author, because rolling or tucking up does not apply only to the sleeves; rather it may also refer to tucking up the hem of the garment and so on. It says in Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah (12/32): “Rolling or tucking up may mean rolling or tucking up the Izar (lower garment or waist wrapper) or Thawb (garment).”\xa0\nAnd this is what is referred to here, i.e., tucking up the garment so that the calf or shin is uncovered. This is what is mentioned in the Hadiths, as in the report narrated by Al-Bukhari (3566): The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came out and it is as if I [the narrator] can see the whiteness of his shins – i.e., because he tucked up his garment and they became visible. Hence when Al-Bukhari narrated the Hadith in a chapter entitled Rolling or tucking up the garment, Al-Hafidh Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said, commenting on the chapter heading: This means lifting up the lower part of the garment. Then he said: From this it may be understood that the prohibition on tucking up the garment when praying applies to something other than the hem of the garment. It is possible that this happened coincidently or that it was during a journey, which is the situation in which the garment may be rolled up.” (End quote from Fat-h Al-Bari, 10/256)\n\nThere are other scholarly views, but perhaps what we have mentioned here is the strongest and most correct of these views.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/141473/can-we-pray-with-folded-sleeves
21694,"What are the definitions of imitating the west? Does everything that is modern and new and has come to us from the west imply imitation of them? In other words, when can we say that something is prohibited because it is an imitation of the Non-Muslims?.","['Praise be to Allah.The concept of imitation in Islam\nIt was narrated that Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Whoever imitates a people is one of them.’” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, Al-Libas, 3512. Al-Albani said in Sahih Abu Dawud, (it is) sound and authentic. No. 3401).\xa0\nAl-Munawi and Al-`Alqami\xa0 (may Allah have mercy on them) said: i.e., dressing as they dress , following their way of life in clothes and some of the things they do.\nAl-Qari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: i.e., whoever imitates the Non-Muslims , such as in how one dresses, etc., or imitates the evil and immoral people, or the Sufis or the righteous, is one of the people whom he imitates, whether they are good or bad.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\nIs it permissible to imitate non-Muslims?\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in As-Sirat Al-Mustaqim: Imam Ahmad and others quoted this Hadith as evidence. This Hadith at the very least implies that it is prohibited to imitate them , as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0{… And if any amongst you takes them [Jews and Christians] as Awliya’ [friends, helpers]), then surely, he is one of them…} [Al-Ma’idah 5:51]\nThis is similar to the view of `Abdullah ibn `Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: “Whoever settles in the land of the polytheists and celebrates their Nawroz (new year) and Mahrajan (festival) and imitates them until he dies will be gathered with them on the Day of Resurrection.” This may be interpreted as referring to absolute imitation which implies disbelief and as meaning that imitation in part is therefore prohibited; or it may be interpreted as meaning that he is one of them to the extent that he imitates them, whether it is in ideas of disbelief, sin or partaking in a ritual. It was narrated from Ibn `Umar that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade imitating the non-Arabs and said, “Whoever imitates a people is one of them.”\xa0\nThis was also mentioned by Al-Qadi Abu Ya`la (may Allah have mercy on him). This was quoted by more than one of the scholars to show that it is disliked to imitate forms of dress of the non-Muslims which are not known among the Muslims. (End quote from `Awn Al-Ma`bud Sharh Sunan Abu Dawud)\xa0\nCategories of imitating Non-Muslims\xa0\nImitating the Non-Muslims falls into two categories:\xa0\nImitation that is prohibited and imitation that is permitted:\xa0\n\nThe first type is imitation that is prohibited: this means knowingly doing things that are unique characteristics of the religion of the Non-Muslims and that have not been referred to in our religion. This is prohibited and it may be a major sin; in some cases a person may even become a disbeliever by doing that, according to the evidence, whether a person does that because he agrees with the Non-Muslims, or because of his whims and desires, or because of some specious arguments which make him feel that doing it will bring him benefit in this world and the next. If it is asked, is the one who does that out of ignorance a sinner, such as one who celebrates Christmas? The answer is that the one who is ignorant is not a sinner because he was unaware, but he has to be told, and if he persists he becomes a sinner.\xa0\n\n\nThe second type is imitation that is permissible. This means doing something which is not originally taken from the Non-Muslims, but the Non-Muslims do it too. This does not involve a prohibition on resembling them, but one may miss out on the benefits of differing from them.\xa0\n\nConditions of imitating Non-Muslims\xa0\nImitating or resembling the People of the Book (Jews and Christians) and others with regard to worldly matters is permissible only when the following conditions are met:\xa0\n\nThat should not be any of their traditions or rituals by which they are distinguished.\nThat should not be part of their religion. A matter can be proven to be part of their religion though a trustworthy source, such as a verse of the Quran or a Hadith of His Messenger, or via well-established reports, such as the prostration of greeting which was permitted to the previous nations.\nThat should not be anything in Islam which refers specifically to that matter. If there is a specific reference in Islam, either approving or disapproving of it, then we must follow what our religion says about it.\nThis resemblance should not lead to going against any of the commands of Shari`ah.\nThat should not involve celebrating any of their festivals.\nThe resemblance should be only according to what is needed, and no more.\xa0(See Al-Sunan wal-Athar fil-Nahy `an At-Tashabbuh bil-Kuffar by Suhayl Hasan, p. 58-59)']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21694/guidelines-on-imitating-non-muslims

138451,"What is the ruling on sex change operations (gender reassignment surgery) in the case of necessity? For example, if a child is born and has genitalia that does not match his gender, and it is possible to surgically reconstruct it? What is the ruling if this child grows up and becomes transgendered, and thus cannot get married, and this is on the basis of medical evidence on which the doctors agree, but social standards reject this surgery, and this sex-change operation is for the sake of medical treatment?","['Praise be to Allah.The Immutable Creation of Allah\n\xa0It is not possible for anyone, no matter who he is, to change the creation of Allah , may He be Exalted, from male to female or vice versa. Whoever Allah, may He be Exalted, has created as a male can never become a female who menstruates and gives birth!\xa0\nYes, the doctors may tamper with him to satisfy his perversion so that he will think that he has become a woman, but he will never be truly female and will live in a state of anxiety and worry, which may lead him to commit suicide.\xa0\nFollowing the Devil in Changing the Creation of Allah\xa0\nWhat a person may feel in his mind and heart, that he is of a gender other than what he appears to be to us does not give him an excuse to change his gender ; rather it comes under the heading of following the devil in changing the creation of Allah – outwardly but not truly – and those feelings do not make it permissible for him to undergo surgery or take medicines and hormones to change his outward appearance. Rather he must be content with the decree of Allah, may He be Exalted, and treat his case on the basis of faith and obedience to Allah. It is not permissible for him to make himself appear outwardly to be of a gender other than his real gender with which Allah created him, otherwise he will be committing a major sin; if this person is really female then she will be masculinised and if he is really male then he will be effeminate.\xa0\nIs sex correction surgery allowed in Islam?\nThe surgery that is permissible in such cases is if a person was originally created male or female, but his genital organs are hidden. In that case it is permissible to do surgery in order to make those organs appear, and to give him or her medicine or hormones to strengthen the characteristics with which Allah originally created him or her.\xa0\nBut in the case of one who was created with both female and male genitalia – this is what is called ambiguous intersex – it is not permissible to be hasty in removing one and making the other more apparent. Rather we should wait until it is known what Allah, may He be Exalted, will decree for this individual, which may become apparent after some time has passed.\xa0\nFor a more detailed discussion on intersex, please see the answer to question no.\xa0114670 \xa0\nIs It Prohibited to Change Your Gender?\nThere follows a detailed fatwa from the scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas, who were asked about a case similar to what is mentioned in the question.\xa0\nThey replied:\xa0\n\nFirstly: Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {To Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He creates what He wills. He bestows female (offspring) upon whom He wills, and bestows male (offspring) upon whom He wills. Or He bestows both males and females, and He renders barren whom He wills. Verily, He is the All-Knower and is Able to do all things.} [Ash-Shura 42:49]. So the Muslim must accept and be content with whatever Allah creates and decrees.\xa0\n\nIn your case, if you are as you mentioned, that you are certain of your masculinity and that you can play the male role efficiently, even if you have not actually engaged in any sexual activity with any person, then you must preserve your masculinity and accept that which Allah has granted to you of virtue and a favourable situation. .\xa0\n\nSecondly: once your masculinity is proven and established, then having surgery to turn into a female – as you think – is changing the creation of Allah, and is an expression of discontent on your part with what Allah has chosen for you, even if we assume that the surgery is going to be successful and lead to what you want of becoming female. But there is no way that it can be successful, for both males and females have their own, distinct faculties and physical makeup, the development and characteristics of which are decreed only by Allah, may He be Exalted, and are not just the penis of the male or the vaginal opening of the female. Rather the man has a complete, integrated system comprising the testicles and other organs, each of which has a special function and characteristics, and produces specific secretions and so on. Likewise the woman has a uterus and other connected parts that work in harmony with it, and each part has its own function and characteristics, and produces specific secretions and so on. Among all of them there are connections and harmony over which none of His creation have any power of estimation, creation, control, management or preservation. Rather all of that is under the control of Allah, the All-Knowing, Most Wise, Most High, Almighty, Most Kind and All-Aware.\xa0\n\nTherefore the surgery that you want to do is a kind of tampering and striving for something in which there is no benefit. In fact it may be dangerous; if it does not lead to death, then at the very least it will lead to taking away that which Allah has given you without you attaining what you want, and you will still be affected by what you have mentioned of psychological problems that you want to get rid of by means of this surgery that is bound to fail.\xa0\n\nThirdly: if your masculinity is not established, and you only think that you are a man because of what you see in your body of outward masculine appearance, in contrast to what you feel in yourself of having feminine characteristics and an inclination towards males and being sexually attracted to them, then you should examine your situation and not go ahead with the surgery that you have mentioned. You should consult experienced specialist doctors. If they determine that you are male in outward appearance but are in fact female, then you may submit yourself to their treatment, so that they can bring out your femininity by doing surgery. But that will not in fact be a sex change from male to female, because this will not be up to them; rather it will be bringing out your true nature and removing what is in your body, and what you feel deep inside you of confusion and ambiguity. But if nothing is clear to the experts, then do not take the risk of undergoing this surgery; be content with the decree of Allah and be patient with what has befallen you, seeking to please your Lord and protecting yourself against the possible consequences of doing an operation without guidance and insight concerning your condition. Turn to Allah and beseech Him to relieve you of what you are facing, and to heal you from your psychological problems, for control of all things is in His hand, may He be Glorified, and He is able to do all things.
