127933,"In the hadith “No one of you believes until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself,” is what is meant that the person is a disbeliever – even if he believes in the Qur’an and Sunnah – until he loves his brothers? Or is what is meant that his faith is not complete? I hope you can explain.","['Praise be to Allah.With regard to the negation of faith in Quranic verses and Hadiths, sometimes what is meant is that the person is not a believer at all, so the person is a disbeliever, and sometimes what is meant is that the person does not have complete faith; thus he is basically a believer, so he is not a disbeliever, but he is lacking in faith.\nThe Hadith asked about is of the second type.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhat it means is that his faith is not complete, otherwise one who has not attained this characteristic is still basically a believer. (End quote from Sharh Muslim, 2/16)\nAl-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhat is meant is that his faith has not reached the perfect level until, in addition to his being a Muslim, people are safe from his harm, he wants good for them and he is sincere towards all of them in his dealings with them. (End quote from Al-Mufhim lima Ashkala min Talkhis Sahih Muslim, 1/224).\nHe also said:\nThat is: his faith is not complete, because the one who deceives a Muslim and is not sincere towards him is committing a major sin, but he does not become a disbeliever as a result, as we have explained more than once.\nBased on that, what the Hadith means is that the one who is described as having perfect faith is the one who is sincere in his dealings with people, so he wants for them what he wants for himself and dislikes for them what he dislikes for himself. (End quote from Al-Mufhim, 1/227).\nWhat indicates that what is meant by the negation of faith in this Hadith is negation of complete faith is the fact that the version of this Hadith narrated by Ibn Hibban says: “No one can attain true faith until he loves for people what he loves for himself of good.” (Al-Albani classed it as authentic in Sahih At-Targhib, 1780).\nAl-Hafidh Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhat is meant by the negation of faith is that the person has not attained complete faith…\nIbn Hibban stated – based on a report of Ibn Abu `Adiy from Husayn Al-Mu`allim – that in the Hadith “No one can attain true faith,” what is meant by “true faith” is complete faith, which means that the one who does not attain this characteristic does not become a disbeliever. (End quote from Fat-h Al-Bari, 1/57).\nIbn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“No one can attain true faith until he loves for people what he loves for himself of good” – this version explains the meaning of the version that is narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim, and demonstrates that what is meant by the negation of faith is that the individual has not attained true or ultimate faith. Faith is often negated because it is lacking some of its essential or obligatory parts, as when the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “No adulterer is a believer at the time when he is committing adultery; no thief is a believer at the time when he is stealing; no drinker of wine is a believer at the time when he is drinking it” and “He does not believe, whose neighbour is not safe from his evil conduct.” (End quote from Jami` Al-`Ulum wal-Hikam, 120)\nWhat is meant by the negation of faith here is the lack of complete faith that is obligatory. So the one who does not love for his brother what he loves for himself is falling short in the faith that is required of him and is committing something that is prohibited, for which he deserves punishment.\nAl-Hafidh Ibn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhen the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said that the one who does not love for his brother what he loves for himself does not truly believe, this indicates that this is one of the characteristics of faith and, in fact, is one of the obligations thereof, for faith cannot be negated unless one of its obligations is not being met, as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said elsewhere: “No adulterer is a believer at the time when he is committing adultery…” Rather a man can only love for his brother what he loves for himself when he is free of envy, rancour, deceit and resentment, and that is something that is obligatory.

228366,"What is the ruling on listening to Surat Al-Mulk, which will save one from the punishment of the grave, before going to sleep, for one who does not know how to read the Quran? Will the reward for that be equal to the reward of one who recites it?","['Praise be to Allah.Virtues of Surat Al-Mulk\nConcerning the virtue of Surat Al-Mulk , it was narrated by At-Tirmidhi (2891) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There is a Surah of the Quran, thirty verses long, which will intercede for a man until he is forgiven. It is the Surah [which begins with the words] ‘Tabaarak alladhi bi yadihi’l-mulk… (Blessed is He in whose hand is dominion…).’” (Classed as sound by Shaykh Al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) in Sahih Sunan At-Tirmidhi)\nAt-Tirmidhi also narrated from Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would not go to sleep until he had recited “Alif, Lam, Mim. [This is] the revelation of the Book” [Surat As-Sajdah ] and “Tabarak alladhi bi yadihi’l-mulk… (Blessed is He in whose hand is dominion…)” [Surat Al-Mulk] (Classed as authentic by Shaykh Al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him))\nAn-Nasa’i (10479) narrated that Ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “Whoever recites ‘Tabarak alladhi bi yadihi’l-mulk… (Blessed is He in whose hand is dominion…)’ [Surat Al-Mulk] every night, Allah will protect him [mana‘ahu] thereby from the punishment of the grave. At the time of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), we used to call it Al-maani‘ah (the protector). It is a Surah in the Book of Allah which, whoever recites it every night, he will have done a great deal and done well.” (Classed as sound by Shaykh Al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) in Sahih At-Targhib wat-Tarhib.)\nThe point – as is the apparent meaning of the Hadiths – is that the virtue mentioned is only attained by the one who recites that Surah.\nWill you be rewarded for listening to Surat Al-Mulk before sleeping?\nWith regard to simply listening, without reading, the one who does that is not regarded as reciting or reading Surat Al-Mulk , even though listening to it is a prescribed act of worship and is something that is required. But he will not necessarily attain the same reward and virtue as the one who reads it. We do not know of any evidence to suggest any basis for regarding the acts as equal.\nBased on that, whoever wants to attain the virtue mentioned in the Hadiths has to read the Surah; it is not sufficient simply to listen to it.\nIf he cannot read it, then he can repeat after the reciter, especially since it is easy to listen via various means. There are recorded recitations that allow the listener to repeat after the reciter. If he is able to do that, then that is better, in sha Allah, and by doing that he will actually have read or recited it, and perhaps he will attain a greater reward for his patience in putting up with the hardship involved in that.\nWhoever is not able to do any of that, or it is too difficult for him, so he only listens to what he is able to, then we hope that he will not be deprived of the reward of one who reads or recites, or the virtues narrated about reciting such Surahs, if he does what he is able to.\nFor more details, please refer to the following answers: 72591 , 75894 , 90186 , and 2241\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/228366/ruling-on-listening-to-surat-al-mulk-before-sleeping
157114,What is the ruling on standing at the graveside after the burial and offering supplication for the deceased?,"['Praise be to Allah.Offering supplication for the deceased after the burial is Sunnah, because of the report narrated by Abu Dawud from `Uthman ibn `Affan (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: When the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) had finished burying a deceased person, he would stand over him and say: “Pray for forgiveness for your brother, and ask that he be made steadfast, for he is being questioned now.” (Al-Albani classed it as authentic in Sahih Abu Dawud)\nAsh-Shawkani (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This hadith indicates that it is prescribed to pray for forgiveness for the deceased when the burial is finished, and to ask that he be made steadfast, because he is being questioned at that time. (End quote from Nayl Al-Awtar, 4/110).\nIbn Al-Mundhir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The majority of scholars said that offering supplication is prescribed. Al-Ajurri and others said: It is recommended to stand [at the graveside] for a short while after the burial and offer supplication for the deceased… At-Tirmidhi said: Standing at the graveside and praying for the deceased at the time of burial is an extra supplication for the deceased after offering the funeral prayer for him, because the prayer of a congregation of Muslims is like a gathering for his sake, like people who have gathered at the door of the king, interceding for him. Standing at the graveside and asking that the deceased be made steadfast is like extra support for those who want to intercede for him, for that is the time when the deceased is tested, for he is now facing the terrifying moment in the grave and the questioning of the two angels. (End quote from Hashiyat Ar-Rawd by Ibn Al-Qasim, 3/124).\nIt says in Al-Mawsu`at Al-Fiqhiyyah (4/41): Praying for forgiveness is a verbal act of worship which it is valid to do for the deceased… Following the burial, it is recommended for a group of people to stand and pray for forgiveness for the deceased, for at that moment he is being questioned by Munkar and Nakir… This was stated by the majority of jurists.

141473,"I am reading Fatwa 11796 , regarding the sleeves and searched for this hadith but couldn’t find the relevant hadith. But as a contradiction, I found this hadith:","[""Praise be to Allah.Can we pray with folded sleeves?\nRolling or tucking up a garment – whether that means rolling up the sleeves and baring the arms or rolling or tucking up the hem and baring the lower legs — is all disliked according to the majority of scholars.\xa0\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“The scholars unanimously agreed that it is not permissible to pray with one's sleeves or garment rolled up and the like, or with one's hair braided or with one's hair wrapped up beneath the turban and so on. All of that is not permissible according to the consensus of the scholars, and it is disliked in the sense of being discouraged and not proper. If a person prays like that, he has done something wrong but his prayer is valid.” (End quote from Sharh Muslim, 209)\xa0\nIn Fat-h Al-Qadir (1/418), which is a Hanafi book, it says:\xa0\nIt is also disliked to pray with the sleeves rolled up, baring the forearms. End quote.\xa0\nIn Tuhfat Al-Muhtaj (2/162), which is a Shaf `i book, it says:\xa0\n“It is disliked to wrap or tie his hair or roll or tuck up his garment, such as rolling up his sleeves or tucking up his hem, even if he only did that in order to work, or he is offering the funeral prayer, because of the Hadith the soundness of which is agreed upon, “I have been commanded to prostrate on seven bones, and not to roll or tuck up my garment or hair.” The reason why that is not allowed when prostrating is that it is contrary to proper focus and humility.” (End quote)\nIn Kashshaf Al-Qina` (1/373), which is a Hanbali book, it says:\xa0\n“It is disliked to roll or tuck up one’s garment. Some of the scholars mentioned the reason for this prohibition as being that the hair and so on prostrate with a person and it is disliked to roll up the sleeves. This was stated in Al-Ri`ayah, for the mentioned reason above. If he does that – i.e., tucks up the hair and rolls up his garment and so on, because of some work that he was doing before the prayer, it is disliked for him to leave them like that, because of what is stated above, and because of the Hadith of Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which he saw `Abdullah ibn Al-Harith praying with his hair braided at the back. He stood up and undid his braid. When `Abdullah had finished praying, he came to Ibn `Abbas and said: What have you to do with my head? He said: I heard the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “The likeness of such a one is that of a person who prays when he is tied up.” (Narrated by Muslim)\nBut the Malikis only regard that as disliked in the case of one who does that for the prayer. But if that is how he was before he prayed, or he did that for the purpose of work, then it is not disliked for him. The majority of scholars — as stated above — are of the view that it is disliked in all cases.\xa0\nIn Sharh Mukhtasar Khalil by Al-Kharashi (1/250), which is a Maliki book, it says:\xa0\n“It is disliked for one who is praying to roll up his sleeves or wrap them around his arm (if they are wide), because that is a kind of distraction from proper focus (Khushu `). That applies if he did that in order to pray. But if that is how he dresses or it was for the purpose of work, then the time for prayer came and he prayed like that, then it is not disliked for him, as was stated by Ibn Yunus, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “I have been commanded to prostrate on seven parts and not to tuck up my hair or garment.” And he said that the prohibition on that only applies if one does that deliberately before praying.” (End quote from Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah, 12/34)\xa0\nExamining the Hadith of Abu Juhayfah about rolling or tucking up one’s garment\nWith regard to the Hadith mentioned in the question, which is the Hadith of Abu Juhayfah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said:\nI saw Bilal bring out an iron-tipped spear and set it up, and the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came out wearing a suit that was rolled or tucked up. He prayed two Rak`ahs, facing the spear, and I saw people and animals passing in front of the spear. This is narrated by Al-Bukhari (5768) in a chapter entitled: Rolling or tucking up one’s garment . He also narrated a longer version (376) and it was also narrated by Muslim (503).\xa0\nImam An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Rolled or tucked up means that it came to mid-calf or thereabouts, as he said in the previous report: It is as if I can see the whiteness of his shins. (End quote from Sharh Muslim, 4/220-221)\nThis Hadith does not contradict what is mentioned above, and we can answer that in many ways, such as the following:\xa0\n\nIt may be understood that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) tucked up his garment to show that it is permissible, and that does not contradict its being disliked, because it is possible that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did some things that are disliked in order to show that they do not reach the level of being prohibited; rather they are disliked only; therefore that action is not disliked in his case (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\xa0\n\n\nIt may be that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came out to his companions with his garment tucked up as it says in the Hadith, then when he wanted to pray, he let it down and got ready to pray, but the narrator did not mention that and did not mention anything to indicate that this was not so either.\xa0\n\n\nThe rolling or tucking up mentioned here does not refer to the sleeves, and it does not refer to rolling up the sleeves, as is the view of the author, because rolling or tucking up does not apply only to the sleeves; rather it may also refer to tucking up the hem of the garment and so on. It says in Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah (12/32): “Rolling or tucking up may mean rolling or tucking up the Izar (lower garment or waist wrapper) or Thawb (garment).”\xa0\nAnd this is what is referred to here, i.e., tucking up the garment so that the calf or shin is uncovered. This is what is mentioned in the Hadiths, as in the report narrated by Al-Bukhari (3566): The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came out and it is as if I [the narrator] can see the whiteness of his shins – i.e., because he tucked up his garment and they became visible. Hence when Al-Bukhari narrated the Hadith in a chapter entitled Rolling or tucking up the garment, Al-Hafidh Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said, commenting on the chapter heading: This means lifting up the lower part of the garment. Then he said: From this it may be understood that the prohibition on tucking up the garment when praying applies to something other than the hem of the garment. It is possible that this happened coincidently or that it was during a journey, which is the situation in which the garment may be rolled up.” (End quote from Fat-h Al-Bari, 10/256)\n\nThere are other scholarly views, but perhaps what we have mentioned here is the strongest and most correct of these views.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/141473/can-we-pray-with-folded-sleeves
21694,"What are the definitions of imitating the west? Does everything that is modern and new and has come to us from the west imply imitation of them? In other words, when can we say that something is prohibited because it is an imitation of the Non-Muslims?.","['Praise be to Allah.The concept of imitation in Islam\nIt was narrated that Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Whoever imitates a people is one of them.’” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, Al-Libas, 3512. Al-Albani said in Sahih Abu Dawud, (it is) sound and authentic. No. 3401).\xa0\nAl-Munawi and Al-`Alqami\xa0 (may Allah have mercy on them) said: i.e., dressing as they dress , following their way of life in clothes and some of the things they do.\nAl-Qari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: i.e., whoever imitates the Non-Muslims , such as in how one dresses, etc., or imitates the evil and immoral people, or the Sufis or the righteous, is one of the people whom he imitates, whether they are good or bad.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\nIs it permissible to imitate non-Muslims?\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in As-Sirat Al-Mustaqim: Imam Ahmad and others quoted this Hadith as evidence. This Hadith at the very least implies that it is prohibited to imitate them , as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0{… And if any amongst you takes them [Jews and Christians] as Awliya’ [friends, helpers]), then surely, he is one of them…} [Al-Ma’idah 5:51]\nThis is similar to the view of `Abdullah ibn `Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: “Whoever settles in the land of the polytheists and celebrates their Nawroz (new year) and Mahrajan (festival) and imitates them until he dies will be gathered with them on the Day of Resurrection.” This may be interpreted as referring to absolute imitation which implies disbelief and as meaning that imitation in part is therefore prohibited; or it may be interpreted as meaning that he is one of them to the extent that he imitates them, whether it is in ideas of disbelief, sin or partaking in a ritual. It was narrated from Ibn `Umar that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade imitating the non-Arabs and said, “Whoever imitates a people is one of them.”\xa0\nThis was also mentioned by Al-Qadi Abu Ya`la (may Allah have mercy on him). This was quoted by more than one of the scholars to show that it is disliked to imitate forms of dress of the non-Muslims which are not known among the Muslims. (End quote from `Awn Al-Ma`bud Sharh Sunan Abu Dawud)\xa0\nCategories of imitating Non-Muslims\xa0\nImitating the Non-Muslims falls into two categories:\xa0\nImitation that is prohibited and imitation that is permitted:\xa0\n\nThe first type is imitation that is prohibited: this means knowingly doing things that are unique characteristics of the religion of the Non-Muslims and that have not been referred to in our religion. This is prohibited and it may be a major sin; in some cases a person may even become a disbeliever by doing that, according to the evidence, whether a person does that because he agrees with the Non-Muslims, or because of his whims and desires, or because of some specious arguments which make him feel that doing it will bring him benefit in this world and the next. If it is asked, is the one who does that out of ignorance a sinner, such as one who celebrates Christmas? The answer is that the one who is ignorant is not a sinner because he was unaware, but he has to be told, and if he persists he becomes a sinner.\xa0\n\n\nThe second type is imitation that is permissible. This means doing something which is not originally taken from the Non-Muslims, but the Non-Muslims do it too. This does not involve a prohibition on resembling them, but one may miss out on the benefits of differing from them.\xa0\n\nConditions of imitating Non-Muslims\xa0\nImitating or resembling the People of the Book (Jews and Christians) and others with regard to worldly matters is permissible only when the following conditions are met:\xa0\n\nThat should not be any of their traditions or rituals by which they are distinguished.\nThat should not be part of their religion. A matter can be proven to be part of their religion though a trustworthy source, such as a verse of the Quran or a Hadith of His Messenger, or via well-established reports, such as the prostration of greeting which was permitted to the previous nations.\nThat should not be anything in Islam which refers specifically to that matter. If there is a specific reference in Islam, either approving or disapproving of it, then we must follow what our religion says about it.\nThis resemblance should not lead to going against any of the commands of Shari`ah.\nThat should not involve celebrating any of their festivals.\nThe resemblance should be only according to what is needed, and no more.\xa0(See Al-Sunan wal-Athar fil-Nahy `an At-Tashabbuh bil-Kuffar by Suhayl Hasan, p. 58-59)']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21694/guidelines-on-imitating-non-muslims
