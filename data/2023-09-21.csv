305491,"Nowadays, Many Android/ios Apps such as E-Wallets offer cashbacks for using their App, Customers can use these apps as per their need,for instance,","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThere is nothing wrong with using the e-wallet for transferring money or buying things, but it is essential to ascertain that the exchange will take place immediately – meaning that the money will reach the seller’s account at the time of purchase – if the customer is going to buy gold, silver or currencies, because it is stipulated that the exchange must take place immediately when buying these things.\nSecondly:\nWhat may be understood from the question is that the purchaser will get cashback from the apps that provide the e-wallet.\nIf what is meant is that the app obtains discounts from sellers for the users of the app, there is nothing wrong with that.\nBut if the app gives the users cash or gifts, in order to encourage them to use the app and deposit money in it, or they announce that whoever loads credit of 200 rupees, for example, will get 50 rupees cashback, this is an unlawful type of gift.\nThat is because putting money in the e-wallet is regarded as a loan to the organisation that provides the app, and it is not permissible to accept gifts in return for a loan, because of the report narrated by Ibn Majah from Yahya ibn Abi Ishaq, who said: I asked Anas ibn Malik about a man among us who gives his brother a loan, then (the borrower) gives him a gift. He said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If any one of you borrows something then he gives (the lender) a gift or gives him a ride on his mount, he should not accept the gift or the ride, unless they used to treat each other in that manner beforehand.” Classed as hasan by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah in al-Fatawa al-Kubra (6/159).\nAl-Bukhari narrated in his Sahih (3814) that Abu Burdah said: I came to Madinah, where I met ‘Abdullah ibn Salam. He said to me: You are living in a land in which riba is prevalent, so if someone owes you something and he gives you a gift of a load of straw, or a load of barley, or a load of foodstuff, do not accept it, for it is riba.\nIt says in al-Ma‘ayir ash-Shar‘iyyah, p. 325: It is not permissible for the borrower to give a specific gift to the lender or to benefit him in any way during the loan period, if that is because of the loan, meaning that that was not something habitual between them before the loan. End quote.\nIt says in Qararat al-Hay’ah ash-Shar‘iyyah li Masraf ar-Rajihi (1/542), statement no. 355 regarding the distribution of specific gifts, such as bishts and watches to customers with current accounts, credit cards or insurance:\nIt is not permissible to give specific gifts, especially to holders of current accounts or some of them, because that comes under the heading of prohibited forms of loans that bring benefits.

421269,When did Adam accept the trust? Was that before he ate the fruit? Or was it when he was on earth? Or do we not know about that?,"['Praise be to Allah.Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Indeed, we offered the Trust to the heavens and the earth and the mountains, and they declined to bear it and feared it; but man [undertook to] bear it. Indeed, he was unjust and ignorant}\xa0[Al-Ahzab 33:72].\nIbn Jarir at-Tabari said in his Tafsir (20/337): the view that is most likely to be correct is the view of those who said that what is meant by the trust in this context is all types of trust in terms of religion, and trusts between people. That is because Allah did not specify any particular type of trusts when He said {we offered the Trust}. End quote.\nIbn Kathir said regarding the difference of opinions among the commentators of the earlier generations regarding the meaning of the trust: All these views do not contradict one another; rather they are agreed on tracing the meaning back to accountability and accepting the commands and prohibitions with their condition, which is that if man undertakes that he will be rewarded and if he neglects it he will be punished. And man accepted that despite his weakness, ignorance and wrongdoing, except those whom Allah helps and guides. And Allah is the one Whose help we seek.End quote from his Tafsir (3/522).\nSecondly:\nWith regard to when Adam took on the trust, it is only narrated from Ibn ‘Abbas in his commentary on the verse (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Indeed, we offered the Trust to the heavens and the earth and the mountains, and they declined to bear it and feared it; but man [undertook to] bear it. Indeed, he was unjust and ignorant}\n[Al-Ahzab 33:72] that he said:\nIt was offered to Adam, and Allah said: Take it with all that it entails; if you obey you will be forgiven, and if you disobey I will punish you.\nAdam said: I accept.\nAll it took was the time between ‘Asr and nightfall on that day, before he committed the sin.\xa0Narrated by at-Tabari (20/327).\nThus it becomes clear that Adam took on the trust when he was still in paradise, before he came down to earth and before he ate from the tree from which he had been forbidden to eat.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/421269/what-is-meant-by-the-trust-which-adam-took-upon-himself-and-when-did-that-happen
