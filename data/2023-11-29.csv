147291,"I know a woman who was in an accident and fell into a coma, which lasted for one month and five days, and for three months she was unable to pray. Please advise us, may Allah reward you with good, what must she do?","['Praise be to Allah.The correct view is that she does not have to make up the missed prayers. If someone has an accident and loses consciousness, then he comes under the same heading as one who is insane or has an intellectual disability, so he does not have to make up missed prayers. If the period of unconsciousness becomes lengthy, then he is more akin to one who is insane or an intellectual disability, so he does not have to make up missed prayers. This is the correct scholarly view. But if the coma only lasted for two or three days, then the person is more like one who was asleep or fainted, so he should make up the missed prayers, as it was narrated from some of the Sahabah that they fell unconscious for a brief period, such as one or two days, so they made up the missed prayers.

190097,"“You pray two Rak`ahs, reciting in each Rak`ah Al-Hamd (i.e., Al-Fatihah) once and At-Tawhid (i.e., Al-Ikhlas) once, making the bowing and prostration lengthy. After finishing the prayer, say: ‘O Most Glorious, O One, O Most Generous, I turn to You by virtue of Muhammad Your Prophet, the Prophet of mercy, (blessings of Allah be upon him and his family); O Muhammad, O Messenger of Allah, I turn by virtue of you to Allah, my Lord and your Lord, the Lord of all things. I ask you, O Allah, to send blessings upon Muhammad and the members of his household, and I ask You for a breath of mercy from You, quick relief, and abundant provision, so that I may put my affairs in order, pay off my debts and support my dependents.’” Is this Hadith authentic?","['Praise be to Allah.Is there a specific Du`a to increase provision?\nIn the authentic Sunnah there is no known prayer specifically for asking for increased provision. The prayer described in the question with this Du`a (supplication) is an innovated prayer; it comes under the heading of prescribing in religion something that Allah has not prescribed, and introducing innovation (Bid`ah) that is prohibited.\xa0\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Ahl As-Sunnah wal-Jama‘ah consider any action or word that is not proven from the Companions to be an innovation (Bid`ah), because if it were something good, they would have done it before us. They did not omit any good attribute but they hastened to do it or attain it.” (Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 7/278-279)\nShaykh Salih Al-Fawzan (may Allah preserve him) said:\xa0\n“The innovations that have been introduced in the area of worship nowadays are many. But the basic principle with regard to acts of worship is Tawqif [i.e., they can only be known through divine Revelation and sound texts of Hadith, with no room for personal opinion], so no acts of worship are prescribed except on the basis of evidence. Anything for which there is no evidence is an innovation (Bid`ah), because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does an action that is not part of this matter of ours will have it rejected.” (Al-Bukhari and Muslim). The acts of worship that are done nowadays for which there is no evidence are very many."" (Kitab At-Tawhid, p. 160 )\nIs it permissible to call upon the Messenger of Allah?\nThe words of the worshipper in this Du`a after this innovated prayer, “I turn to You by virtue of Muhammad Your Prophet , the Prophet of mercy, (blessings of Allah be upon him and his family); O Muhammad, O Messenger of Allah, I turn by virtue of you to Allah…” are words that are not permissible, and come under the heading of innovated Tawassul (means of seeking to draw closer to Allah) that is forbidden.\xa0\nAnyone who calls upon the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) after his death , or who calls upon anyone else among the dead to ward off harm or bring benefits has committed major Shirk (associating partners with Allah) that puts one beyond the pale of Islam, and he has to repent to Allah, may He be Exalted.\xa0\nHow to increase provision in Islam\nThere are some means of increasing provision that are prescribed in Islam, which we shall highlight here, so as to adopt the means that are prescribed and warn against innovations in religion. These include:\xa0\n\nIstighfar (praying for forgiveness): Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n“I said (to them): Ask forgiveness from your Lord; Verily, He is Oft-Forgiving; He will send rain to you in abundance; And give you increase in wealth and children, and bestow on you gardens and bestow on you rivers.”\xa0[Nuh 71:10-12]\xa0\n\nUpholding ties of kinship: Al-Bukhari (2067) and Muslim (2557) narrated from Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever would like his provision to be increased and his life to be extended , should uphold the ties of kinship.”\xa0\n\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“The term ‘His provision to be increased’ means to be expanded and made abundant or, it was said, to be blessed (Barakah).”\n\nGiving a great deal of charity: Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n\n“Say: Truly, my Lord enlarges the provision for whom He wills of His slaves, and (also) restricts (it) for him, and whatsoever you spend of anything (in Allah’s Cause), He will replace it. And He is the Best of providers.”\xa0[Saba’ 34:39]\xa0\nMuslim (2588) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Charity does not decrease wealth.”\xa0\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“The scholars mentioned two meanings of this Hadith, one of which is that (the wealth) will be blessed (as a result of giving charity ) and harm will be warded off from it, so the apparent decrease will be compensated for by means of hidden blessing. This is something that is well known from experience. The second is that even if it appears to be decreased outwardly, there will be compensation for that in the reward that results from it, and it will be increased manifold.”\xa0\n\nBeing mindful of Allah and fearing Him: Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n“And whosoever fears Allah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty). And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine.”\xa0[At-Talaq 65:2-3]\xa0\n\nPerforming Hajj and `Umrah often, following one with the other: At-Tirmidhi (810) narrated that `Abdullah ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Make the Hajj and `Umrah follow each other closely, for they remove poverty and sins as the bellows removes the dross of iron, gold and silver, and an accepted Hajj brings no less a reward than Paradise.” (It was classed as authentic by Al-Albani)\xa0\nDu`a (supplication) : It was narrated by Ibn Majah (925) from Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to say, after he said the Salam at the end of Fajr prayer: “Allahumma inni as’aluka `ilman nafi`an, wa rizqan tayyiban, wa `amalan mutaqabbalan (O Allah, I ask you for beneficial knowledge,\xa0good (lawful) provision, and accepted good deeds).” (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah)\xa0\n\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/190097/how-to-increase-provision
471887,I noticed that many worshippers compete to pray behind the imam in the mosque. Is there any particular virtue in that? Is that virtue only connected to the first row and the right-hand side of the first row?,"['Praise be to Allah.It is narrated that there is a particular virtue in competing to pray in the first row and the next row, and so on, behind the imam.\nAl-Bukhari (615) and Muslim (437) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If the people knew what there is (of reward) in the call and the first row, and they could find no other way than drawing lots, then they would draw lots. If they know what there is (of reward) in coming early to prayer, they would compete for it. If they knew what there is (of reward) in ‘Isha’ and Fajr prayer, they would come to them even if they had to crawl.”\nMuslim (438) narrated from Abu Sa‘id al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) saw some of his companions going towards the back (of the mosque). He said to them: “Come forward and follow me (in the prayer), and let those who are behind you follow you, for people will keep moving to the back until Allah puts them back (from great reward or high status).”\nRegarding the virtue of being close to the imam on Friday in particular, there is a report narrated by Samurah ibn Jundub, according to which the Prophet of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Attend the reminder (the khutbah) and come close to the imam, for if a man continues to distance himself, his admittance to Paradise will be delayed, even if he enters it.” Narrated by Abu Dawud (1108). Shaykh al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Its isnad is sahih. Al-Hakim said: It is sahih according to the conditions of Muslim, and al-Dhahabi agreed with him. End quote from Sahih Sunan Abi Dawud (Gharras edn., 4/271).\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWith regard to Jumu‘ah prayer and other prayers, the people should fill the gaps in the first row, then the next row, and so on, as it was narrated in al-Sahihayn that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Why do you not stand in rows as the angels stand in rows before their Lord?” They said: How do the angels stand in rows before their Lord? He said: “They complete the first rows and leave no gaps in the rows.” So no one should fill gaps in the back rows when there are still gaps in the front rows, and no rows should be formed in the streets and stores when there is still space inside the mosque… Rather if the rows in the mosque have been filled and there is no more space, then they may form rows outside the mosque, and if there are no large gaps between the rows and they form rows in the streets and marketplaces, then their prayer is valid…""(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa\xa023/209-210).\nThe scholars regarded it as recommended (mustahabb) to stand on the right-hand side of the row. Among the evidence they quoted for that is the report narrated by Imam Muslim (709) from al-Bara’, who said: When we prayed behind the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), we liked to be on his right so that his face would turn towards us. And I heard him say: “O Lord, save me from Your punishment on the Day when You resurrect or gather Your slaves.”\nThey also regarded it is recommended to be close to the imam, as is mentioned in the hadith of Abu Mas‘ud, who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to touch our shoulders when we were praying and he would say: “Make the rows straight and do not differ, lest your hearts differ. Let those who are adults and mature in thinking be closest to me, then those who come after them, then those who come after them.” \xa0Narrated by Muslim (432).\nIbn al-Jawzi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: He only enjoined that for three reasons, the first of which is preferring them to be in the first row. Secondly, it was so that they might understand what movement he was doing; and thirdly, because he might need them to remind him if he made an error, or he might need them to take over and lead the prayer if something happened to him. By giving preference to them, this teaches those who have less knowledge to show good manners and keep away from that place. And his words “then those who come after them” refer to those who are lower in status.""(Kashf al-Mushkil\xa0 1/327).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIs the right-hand side best in all cases, meaning the right-hand side of any row, or if the space on the right is far away from the imam, is the left-hand side better if the space is closer to the imam?\nThe answer is: the right-hand side is better if the space is closer to the imam, and the evidence for that is the fact that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not say: Complete the right, then the next right, and so on. Rather he said: “Complete the first row, then the next, and so on.” Hence we say regarding the first and second rows that the first row is better than the second, even if one can stand in line with the imam in the second row, and the space in the first row is at the very end of the row, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) enjoined us to complete the first row, then the next, and so on. As for the right-hand side, he did not say: Complete the right then the next right, and so on. If the right-hand side was better in all cases, he would have said: Complete the right then the next right, and so on. Based on that, we say: If spaces on the right and left are of a similar distance from the imam, then the space on the right-hand side is better. If spaces on the right and the left are equally distant from the imam, then the space on right-hand side is better. But if the space on the right is further away from the imam, then the space on the left-hand side is better, because it is closer to the imam, and being close to the imam is something desirable according to Islamic teachings.""(Liqa’ al-Bab al-Maftuh\xa0 215/10).\nSummary:\nCompeting to be in the first rows and to be close to the imam is something recommended (mustahabb), and the virtue of the first row is greater than that of the second, and the second is better than the third, and so on.\nBeing on the right-hand side of the first row is better than being on the left-hand side of it, but being on the left-hand side of the front row is better than being on the right-hand side of the row behind it. Standing in the back rows when one is able to move forward is blameworthy.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/471887/is-praying-in-the-first-row-is-better-than-praying-in-other-rows
113852,"What is the ruling on making a deposit in an Islamic bank, such as the Faisal Islamic Bank?","['Praise be to Allah.What is a deposit?\nA deposit (Wadi`ah) is something that is left with someone else for safekeeping, without the other person having the authority to dispose of it. This is applicable to the safety deposit boxes that may be found in hotels and elsewhere, and also in some banks.\nWith regard to bank deposits, that is something different, because the bank does not keep the exact money [that you deposit]; rather the bank disposes of it.\nThis is as far as names are concerned.\xa0\nTypes of bank deposits\nWith regard to the rulings, bank deposits are of two types:\n\nThe first type is a non-investment deposit, which is also called a demand deposit account or a current account. How it works is that the customer deposits his money in the bank on the basis that he can withdraw it whenever he wants, without making any profit or gain from the process. There is nothing wrong with this idea, because in a way it is a loan from the customer to the bank. But if the bank is Riba-based, it is not permissible to deposit money in it, because the bank will benefit from this money and use it to support it in its prohibited activities.\n\nHowever, if the customer needs to put his money in the bank for safekeeping, and there is no Islamic bank where he can put his money to keep it safe, then in that case there is nothing wrong with him putting his money in a Riba-based bank .\n\nThe second type is investment deposits, in which the customer puts his money in the bank in return for profits or dividends to be paid at set intervals, as agreed.\n\nForms of investment deposits\nThis type of deposit may take several forms, some of which are permissible and some are prohibited.\n\nOne of the permissible forms is where there is a profit-sharing (Mudharabah) contract between the customer and the bank. In this case, the bank invests the money in permissible projects, in return for a set share of the returns. There are several conditions that are to be met in this case:\n\n\nThe bank should invest the money in permissible enterprises, such as establishing beneficial projects, building houses, and the like. It is not permissible to invest the money in building Riba-based banks or cinemas, or lending with interest to the needy. Based on that, it is essential to know the nature of the investment that the bank will make.\nThere should be no guarantee of the capital. So the bank should not commit to return the capital if the bank incurs loss, so long as there has been no shortcoming on the bank’s part that resulted in the loss.\n\nThat is because, if the capital is guaranteed, then this in reality is a loan contract, and any profit that it brings is regarded as Riba (usury).\n\nThe profit should be defined and agreed upon from the outset, but it should be defined as a percentage of the profit, not of the capital. So one of the two parties should get, for example, one third or one half or 20% of the profits, with the remainder going to the other party. The contract is not valid if the percentages of the profit are not known or defined. The fuqaha’ stated that profit-sharing (mudaarabah) is rendered invalid if the shares of profits are unknown.\n\nProhibited forms of investment\nProhibited forms of investment include the following:\n\nIf the capital is guaranteed, so the customer deposits 100, for example, in order to get interest of 10, along with a guarantee of the one hundred. This is a Riba-based loan, and it is the regular practice in most banks.\n\nIt may be called a deposit, or investment certificates or a savings account , and the returns may be shared periodically, or by drawing lots, as in the case of Class C investment certificates . All of that is prohibited.\xa0\n\nIf the bank invests the money in prohibited projects, such as building cinemas and tourist results, in which evils are widespread and many sins are committed, it is prohibited to invest in this bank in that case, because this comes under the heading of cooperating in sin and transgression.\n\nThis is a brief overview of different types of deposits in banks.\nResolution of Islamic Fiqh Council on bank deposits\nIn a statement of the Islamic Fiqh Council belonging to the OIC (Organization of Islamic Cooperation, formally the Organization of the Islamic Conference) it says the following:\n\nDeposits that may be withdrawn at any time (demand deposit account or current account), whether they are in Islamic banks or Riba-based banks, constitute loans according to the Islamic jurisprudential point of view, as the bank which receives these deposits is entrusted with them (and liable for them), and are required according to Shari`ah to return the money on request.\n\nThe fact that it is a loan is not altered by the fact that the bank is wealthy.\n\nBank deposits may be divided into two types, according to the regular practices of the bank:\n\n\nDeposits on which interest is paid, as is the case in Riba-based banks. These are prohibited Riba-based loans, regardless of whether the type of deposit is a demand deposit account (current account), or a deposit that is made for a set period, or a deposit for which notice must be given for withdrawal, or a savings account.\nDeposits given to banks that are committed to operating in accordance with the rulings of Islamic Shari`ah on the basis of an investment contract, in return for a share of the profit; these deposits are regarded as capital for profit-sharing (Mudharabah) contracts, and are subject to the rulings on profit-sharing (Mudharabah) contracts according to Islamic Fiqh (jurisprudence). These rulings include the impermissibility of the bank guaranteeing the capital (or being liable for it).” (Majallat Majma‘ Al-Fiqh, issue no. 9, part i, p. 931)\n\nIf the Faisal Bank adheres to these guidelines, namely investing the money in permissible projects and not guaranteeing the customer’s capital, and agreeing with the customer on a defined share of the profits, then there is nothing wrong with making investment deposits in this bank, and there is also nothing wrong with opening a current account with it.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/113852/what-types-of-deposits-are-allowed-in-islamic-banks
