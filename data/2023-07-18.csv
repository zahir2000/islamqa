290605,"I had a problem with my grandmother when she was sick. She said to me: “This is my wasiyyah (instructions) to you” in front of my maternal aunt and her daughters. The wasiyyah said: “I do not want to see you when I am alive or when I am dead, not when they wash my body, not when they bury me and not when people gather to offer condolences to the family. I disavow you until the Day of Judgement. I wish that you had died with your mother and that I never laid eyes on you.” What is the ruling on this wasiyyah?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIf you were innocent of this accusation and you did not touch anything of her wealth, then you have nothing to worry about and her claims will not harm you. You should be patient and seek reward with Allah, for Allah has made a promise to those who are patient, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{but give good tidings to the patient\nWho, when disaster strikes them, say, “Indeed we belong to Allah, and indeed to Him we will return.”\nThose are the ones upon whom are blessings from their Lord and mercy. And it is those who are the [rightly] guided}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:155-157].\nSecondly:\nA wasiyyah giving instructions to prevent someone from visiting a person when he is alive or from attending his burial and condolence gathering if he dies is a haram kind of wasiyyah, because of what it includes of calling for severing ties of kinship. Hence it does not have to be carried out.\nIt is not obligatory to carry out any wasiyyah except that which instructs people to do righteous deeds.\nIbn Rushd (may Allah have mercy on him) said: There is no obligation to carry out a wasiyyah except one which gives instructions to do righteous deeds.""(Al-Bayan wa’t-Tahsil\xa0 2/287).\nKhalil said in his Mukhtasar: The wasiyyah is invalid if the person apostatizes or if it gives instructions to commit sin. End quote.\nIt says in Minah al-Jalil (9/512): [The wasiyyah] is invalid if it gives instructions to commit sin, such as if the person bequeaths money to one who will use it to buy wine and drink it, or to kill someone whose life is protected by Islamic law, or to wail for him. End quote.\nThe jurists stipulated that the instructions given in the wasiyyah should not involve sin, as was narrated above from the jurists.\nIt says in al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (43/258), on the topic of conditions regarding instructions given in a wasiyyah:\nThe instructions should not involve sin or anything that is prohibited according to Islamic teachings:\n51. The purpose of giving instructions before death (wasiyyah) is to make up for what the person has missed of righteous deeds during his lifetime, so it is not permissible for the instructions to involve any sin. End quote.\nMoreover, when the jurists speak of wasiyyah, they speak of bequeathing wealth that has value, or whatever comes under the same heading. [See: al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (43/254-258)]. Based on that, this and similar questions do not come under the heading of wasiyyah at all. The purpose behind quoting the words of the jurists here is to highlight that the fact that they stated that it is haram to give any instructions that involve sin indicates that such behaviour is not allowed. Moreover, this kind of instruction does not come under the heading of the wasiyyah that the jurists usually discuss at all, even if there is no sin involved. So how about if the wasiyyah involves sin and an attempt to assert control that serves no purpose for the deceased whatsoever; in fact it comes under the heading of mischief that would lead to more enmity and rancour, and calls for sin and severing ties of kinship, as is quite obvious?\nConclusion:\nThese instructions to prevent someone from attending the funeral of the deceased or praying for him, and the like, do not come under the heading of wasiyyah as it is known in Islamic teachings, which must be carried out. Rather they are more akin to sin and severing ties of kinship, as may be understood from the question. The deceased has no right to do that and there is no interest to be served by it, in addition to what it involves of depriving the deceased of supplication for him and prayers for his forgiveness. All of that is prohibited.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/290605/a-haram-wasiyyah-instructions-given-by-one-who-is-dying
258651,"Will the Muslim be rewarded for reciting dhikr without focus of mind (reciting dhikr automatically)? Will he be rewarded for that, such as reciting tahlil (La ilaha illa Allah) or istighfar (Astaghfirullah), but without focus of mind? Will he receive the reward in full, as mentioned in the hadiths that speak of dhikr?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nWhat the Muslim should do is remember Allah, may He be exalted, properly, so that he will reap the benefits of dhikr and achieve its objectives, which cannot be achieved unless the verbal dhikr is accompanied by dhikr in the heart, for it is not sufficient for the person to simply move his lips and tongue in dhikr.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{The believers are only those who, when Allah is mentioned, their hearts become fearful, and when His verses are recited to them, it increases them in faith; and upon their Lord they rely}\xa0[al-Anfal 8:2].\nThe benefits of dhikr – namely fear of Allah and increased faith – cannot be attained except through reflection and contemplation.\nShaykh ‘Abd ar-Rahman as-Sa‘di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n{are only those who, when Allah is mentioned, their hearts become fearful} that is, they are filled with fear and awe, and that fear of Allah (st) dictates that they should refrain from that which is prohibited. Fear of Allah (st) is one of the greatest signs that restrain one from committing sin.\n{and when His verses are recited to them, it increases them in faith}, the reason being that they listen to them with presence of mind, contemplating the meaning, and as a result of that their faith increases, because contemplation is one of the actions of the heart, and it is inevitable that they will learn a meaning that they did not know, or they will be reminded of something that they had forgotten, or it will make their hearts inclined towards good and make them long for the reward of their Lord, or will make them fear His punishment, or they will be deterred from sin. All of these are things that increase one in faith.""(Tafsir as-Sa‘di, p. 315).\nBeing content merely to recite dhikr verbally, without reflection in the heart, will not lead to the hoped-for benefits of dhikr as it should be done, and it will be an action that falls short.\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nDhikr with focus and reflection will increase a person’s knowledge of Allah and love of Him; it will make him feel shy before Him and prompt fear of His punishment, and it will make him realise that Allah is constantly watching him, which will deter him from falling short in doing acts of worship or being careless in committing sins and doing bad deeds.\nDhikr that is only verbal will not lead to any of these benefits, and if it does lead to any of that, it will be lacking.""(Al-Wabil as-Sayyib ( p. 221).\nSecondly:\nIf the Muslim falls short and only recites dhikr verbally, will he be rewarded?\nIt was said that yes, he will be rewarded as befits his deed, for moving the tongue with words remembering Allah is a righteous deed with which the tongue is occupied, and it is a verbal act of worship. If he reflects in his heart on what his tongue is uttering, that is good, otherwise his reward will be commensurate with his action.\nHowever, there will inevitably be some sort of reflection in the heart on what he is saying, even if it is not perfect, and he will think of what he is saying to some extent. Hence he will choose a supplication (du‘a’), for example, in one situation, and he will choose istighfar or pure dhikr in other situations, and so on, and Allah has ordained reward for every action.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAl-Qadi ‘Iyad (may Allah have mercy on him) said: dhikr or remembrance of Allah, may He be exalted, is of two types: dhikr in the heart and dhikr on the tongue… As for dhikr on the tongue or purely verbal dhikr, it is the least type of dhikr, but it is still of great value, as mentioned in the hadiths.""(Sharh Sahih Muslim\xa0 17/15).\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf dhikr is recited verbally only, the one who utters it will be rewarded.\nIt is not stipulated that he should focus on the meaning, but it is stipulated that he should not intend its meaning in a wrong way.\nIf, in addition to uttering the words, he focuses on them in his heart, that is better.\nIf, in addition to that, he bears in mind the meaning of the words and what they contain of venerating Allah, may He be exalted, and denying that He has any shortcomings, that is even better.""(Fath al-Bari\xa0 11/209).\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWith regard to dhikr, people are at four levels:\n\nDhikr in the heart and on the tongue; this is what is enjoined.\nDhikr in the heart only. If the person is unable to speak, that is fine, but if he is able to speak, then he has failed to do what is better.\nDhikr on the tongue only. In this case the person is keeping his tongue moist with the remembrance of Allah, as is mentioned in the story of the person in whom the angels found nothing good to his credit except that he kept moving his tongue in remembrance of Allah. Allah, may He be exalted, says (in the hadith qudsi): “I am with My slave so long as he remembers Me and his lips move in remembrance of Me.”\nWhen there is neither kind of dhikr. This is the state of the losers.""(Majmu‘ Fatawa\xa010/566).\n\nFor more information, please see the answers to questions no. 72826 and 235993 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/258651/ruling-on-reciting-dhikr-without-focus-of-mind-and-reflection
