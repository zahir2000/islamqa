166106,How can I differentiate between maniy (semen) and madhiy (prostatic fluid)? Is it by smell?,"['Praise be to Allah.There are three basic differences between semen and prostatic fluid. They are:\n1.. Semen is emitted forcefully, whereas prostatic fluid is not emitted forcefully, and the individual may not feel that it is emitted.\n2.. Semen is a white, thick fluid, which smells like palm tree pollen or dough, whereas prostatic fluid is a thin, clear, sticky fluid that has no smell.\n3.. Emission of semen is followed by loss of desire, whereas the emission of prostatic fluid is not followed by loss of desire.\nAn-Nawawi said in al-Majmu‘ (2/141):\nEach of these three is sufficient on its own to determine that it is semen, and it is not stipulated that all three characteristics be present. If none of these characteristics is present, then it is not semen. End quote.\nIt says in Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah (4/138):\nManiy (semen) is a thick white liquid that is emitted from the penis with feelings of pleasure. After it is emitted, the individual feels tired. Semen is pure (tahir) according to the correct scholarly view, but it is recommended (mustahabb) to clean it off one’s garment by washing or scratching it. Emitting semen makes ghusl obligatory, whether it happens as a result of intercourse or a wet dream. If it is emitted without feelings of pleasure, because of sickness or intense cold, then it does not make ghusl obligatory; rather it becomes obligatory to do wudu only.\nMadhiy (prostatic fluid) is thin, white and sticky. It is emitted from the penis during foreplay with one’s wife, or when thinking about sex, but it is not emitted forcefully and does not lead to tiredness. Prostatic fluid is impure (najis), and if it is emitted the individual must do wudu, wash the penis and testicles, and sprinkle water over where it got onto his body and clothes.\nWadiy is a thin, white fluid that may be emitted from the penis after urinating. It is impure (najis) and makes it obligatory to do wudu.

82907,My wife recently became pregnant for the second time and we want to announce it to everyone. Is it permissible to announce it right away or is there a waiting period of three months before announcing pregnancy? Could you please tell me what the ruling is on that.,"['Praise be to Allah.We ask Allah to bless you with righteous offspring and to bless this child.\xa0\nThere is nothing wrong with telling other people about the pregnancy after you find out about it, and it is not essential to wait until three months have passed. Rather it is permissible to tell others before then, but you should limit that to family and close friends only. This is a general principle which should be paid attention to when telling others of blessings. The news should be given only to those who wish good for you and will rejoice over it, so as to ward off the evil eye and destructive envy.\xa0\nThe evidence for that is the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Be discreet in order to achieve what you want, for everyone who is blessed is envied.” (Narrated by At-Tabarani and Abu Nu`aym; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Al-Jami`, no. 943)\xa0\nFor more details, please refer to the following answers: 82465 , 119767 , 12368 , 7889 , 12287 , and 88734 . \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/82907/when-to-announce-pregnancy-in-islam
257661,"I moved to the USA from Australia to be with my husband, I have been back and forth since 2014. I haven't been very unhappy lately in the marrige due to my rights not being fulfilled, I've seeked many counsilings with the Muslims in the community but my husband keeps violating my rights. I recently asked my husband for a divorce due to my rights constantly being violated in numerous ways but then I found out I am pregnant. My husband isn't able to provide for me or the child and depends on me and his mother to financially support him, we were recently homeless and staying in motels due to the fact that his mother didn't accept our marriage or respect our religious beliefes (she is not Muslim) and my parents had to send me $4000 just to get us off the street and put us in a place with funiture ect...because my husband wasn't able to do what he had to. in the USA I am not able to have any type of Financially easy healthcare which leaves me with very large bills and he expects me to pay all of this on my own. When My husband does have money he worries about himself first before me. I have the option to go back to my parents where myself and the child will be taking care of but that is back in Australia, I've given my husband the option to move to Australia but he doesn't want to leave the USA. Please can you provide any evidence and explanations to the evidence that it is ok for me to stay in Australia with the child due to the fact that he cannot provide for me?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe maintenance of the wife is mandatory upon the husband even if she is wealthy; due to the saying of Allah (translation of the meaning): Let a man of wealth spend from his wealth, and he whose provision is restricted - let him spend from what Allah has given him. Allah does not burden a soul beyond what He has given it. Allah will bring about, after hardship, ease. (At-Talaq 65:7), and His saying (translation of the meaning): But the father of the child shall bear the cost of the mother\'s food and clothing on a reasonable basis. (Al-Baqarah 2:233)\nAnd the saying of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) in his sermon during the Farewell Pilgrimage: “Fear Allah with regard to women, for you have taken them as a trust from Allah and intimacy with them has become permissible to you by the words of Allah. Your right over them is that they should not allow anyone to sit on your furniture whom you dislike; if they do that then hit them but not in a harsh manner. And their right over you is that you should provide for them and clothe them on a reasonable basis.”\xa0 Narrated by Muslim (1218).\nAnd his saying (peace and blessings be upon him) to Hind, the wife of Abu Sufyan: ""Take what is sufficient for you and your child on a reasonable basis."" Narrated by Al-Bukhari (5364).\nThe wife is not obliged to work, and if she does to assist her husband, she is doing good and volunteering.\nThe mandatory maintenance includes accommodation, food, drink, and clothing. It is estimated according to the condition of both spouses. If they are affluent, then she is entitled to the maintenance of the affluent; if they are in hardship, then she is entitled to the maintenance of those in hardship; if they are of moderate means, then she is entitled to the maintenance of those of moderate means; and if one of them is affluent and the other is in hardship, then she is entitled to the maintenance of those of moderate means, whether he is the affluent one or she is.\nThis is the opinion given by the Hanafis, the relied upon opinion among the Malikis, and the opinion of the Hanbalis, reconciling between the texts and considering the circumstances of both sides.\nSee: Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah (5/254).\nSecondly:\nIf the husband is unable to provide maintenance, the wife has the choice to be patient and stay with him, or to choose to leave him according to the majority of Jurists.\nIn Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah (41/66): ""They differed in the case where the husband is in hardship, and his wife is not pleased to stay with him, regarding her right to request separation between her and him, on two opinions:\nThe first opinion: She does not have the right to request separation, and the husband should not prevent her from earning to spend on herself. This was the opinion of Ibn Shubrumah, Hammad ibn Abi Sulayman, `Ata\', Az-Zuhri, Al-Hasan, Ibn Abi Layla, and others, and it is the opinion of the Hanafis...\nThe second opinion: The woman has the right to request separation from her husband due to his inability to provide maintenance, and if he refuses, the judge should separate them.\nThis is the opinion of the Malikis, the more apparent opinion among the Shafi`is, and the correct opinion among the Hanbalis.\nThis separation is considered dissolution (annulment) according to the Shafi`is and Hanbalis, and a revocable divorce according to the Malikis, and this is narrated from `Umar, Abu Hurairah, and Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with them), and it was the opinion of Sa`id ibn Al-Musayyib, Al-Hasan, Ishaq, Abu Thawr, and others.\nThey based this on the words of Allah (translation of the meaning): Then keep them in an acceptable manner or release them with good treatment.\xa0(Al-Baqarah 2:229), for Allah Almighty has commanded to keep the wife in a reasonable manner, or to release her with good treatment, and the husband\'s failure to provide for her negates keeping her in a reasonable manner, so the second option, which is releasing her with good treatment, becomes necessary.\nIt was narrated that `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) wrote to the commanders of the troops who were away from their wives in Madinah, ordering them to return to their wives. They could either divorce them or maintain the marriage, sending them maintenance. And whoever separated from their wives should send maintenance for what had passed.\nIt was narrated from Sa`id ibn Al-Musayyib that Abu Az-Zinad asked him about a man who does not find what to spend on his wife, he said: They should be separated. Abu Az-Zinad said: A Sunnah? He said: A Sunnah.\nAsh-Shafi`i said: And it seems that it is the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him).\nSince dissolution (annulment) is established due to inability to have intercourse, and the harm in it is less, then it is more fitting to be established due to inability to provide maintenance, which the body cannot do without"" End quote.\nThirdly:\nIf the wife chooses dissolution (annulment), then custody of her child is hers until the child reaches seven years of age, unless she travels or marries, then custody moves to the next in line, according to the difference among Jurists.\nThe majority of Jurists have gone to the opinion that the most entitled to custody after the mother is her mother - provided that she is also in the father\'s country. See: ""Al-Mughni"" (8/197), ""Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah"" (15/122).\nSomeome scholars have gone to the opinion that the father takes precedence over the mother\'s mother, and this is the preferred view of Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah and Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on them).The basis for this is the Hadith of `Abdullah ibn `Amr (may Allah be pleased with them) that a woman said: O Messenger of Allah, this son of mine was carried by my womb, suckled from my breast, and took refuge in my lap. His father has divorced me and wants to take him away from me?\nThe Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said to her: ""You are more entitled to him as long as you do not marry."" Narrated by Ahmad (6707) and Abu Dawud (2276), and Al-Albani graded it sound in Sahih Abu Dawud, and Ibn Kathir authenticated it in ""Irshad Al-Faqih"" (2/250).\nAs for the custodian\'s travel, it causes her to lose her right to custody; as it is in the child\'s best interest to be close to his father to see him and be cared for.\nIt is stated in ""Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah Al-Kuwaitiyyah"" (17/308-309):\n""The place of custody is the residence where the father of the custodian lives if the custodian is his mother\n\nand she is still married to him\n,or in her waiting period from a revocable or irrevocable divorce...\n\nIf the mother\'s waiting period is over, then the place of custody is the city where the father of the custodian or his guardian resides, and likewise if the custodian is not the mother, because the father has the right to see the custodian and supervise his upbringing, and this cannot be achieved unless the custodian resides in the city of the father or the guardian.\nThis is a shared view among the schools of thought, and it is what the Hanafis explicitly stated and what is indicated by the expressions of the other schools of thought"" End quote.\nFor benefit, please see the answer to question no. (8189 ).\nFourthly:\nIf the wife chooses to dissolve (annul) the marriage and separate from her husband, it is apparent that she has taken control of her affairs, and she may return to her country and reside where her family lives.\nHowever, if she does not choose dissolution (annulment), then it is not permissible for her to travel or leave the house without the permission of her husband, due to the general evidence indicating the necessity of her staying at home, the obligation of being with her husband, and seeking his permission to leave his house.\nHowever, with the husband\'s inability to provide, some Jurists said that he does not have the right to prevent her from working and earning.\nSee: Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti` (13/493).\nIn conclusion:\nIf the husband is unable to provide the mandatory maintenance, and you - the wife - are content with the continuation of the marriage: then you do not have the right to travel except with his permission and approval, so let there be understanding between you about what is best and most suitable.\nAnd the husband should take the means, seek permissible work, ask Allah Almighty for provision and help, and increase in righteous deeds, for they are among the means of provision, as Allah Almighty said (translation of the meaning): And whoever fears Allah - He will make for him a way out and will provide for him from where he does not expect. And whoever relies upon Allah - then He is sufficient for him. Indeed, Allah will accomplish His purpose. Allah has already set for everything a [decreed] extent.\xa0(At-Talaq 65:2-3).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/257661/moving-child-away-due-to-husbands-inability-to-maintain-them
