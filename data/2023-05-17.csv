257654,"I have a number of questions about a specific topic, namely: interacting with non-Muslims and loving them. Firstly, if the following things are haram: 1. making friends with non-Muslims, 2. loving non-Muslims 3. and similar issues having to do with the way we relate to non-Muslims – then 1. how can a Muslim help non-Muslims to enter Islam? Do not tell me the argument which says that if helping non-Muslims is for the purpose of softening their hearts and calling them to Islam, then that is fine, because I wonder how you can call them to Islam when you are just pretending to befriend them, and you are not sincere in this friendship? I hope that you will not mention this matter as part of the answer. 2. Marriage of a Muslim man to a non-Muslim woman. The question in this case is: isn’t Islam a religion of love and peace? Then how can it be prohibited to love non-Muslims and to deal with non-Muslims as we deal with Muslims? I have many questions, but I feel that the type of questions I want to ask is haram, so I will keep my mouth shut and not ask them. But I hope that you can answer me in a very precise and comprehensive manner. I may sound foolish for asking these questions, but I am trying to learn more and more about my religion.","['Praise be to Allah.I.\nThe Muslim should take measures to increase and strengthen his faith and make him steadfast, because if someone has doubts, that makes it difficult to understand the wisdom behind the shar‘i commands that cannot be dispelled except through questioning. In this case, he must ask, because the shar‘i principle says: that without which an obligatory duty cannot be done is also obligatory. And Allah, may He be exalted, has instructed us to ask people of knowledge, as He, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{So ask those who have knowledge\xa0 if you do not know}\xa0[an-Nahl 16:43].\nFor the Muslim to ask people of knowledge in order to dispel doubts and intrusive thoughts is something praiseworthy. Asking is only blameworthy if it is done for the purpose of showing stubbornness, stirring up doubts or impressing people.\nIbn ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf someone asks for the purpose of understanding, seeking to acquire knowledge and eliminate ignorance, and seeking to understand something he is required by Islam to understand, there is nothing wrong with that, for the remedy for the one who does not know is asking.\nBut if someone asks in order to cause trouble, and he is not seeking to find out and learn, that is not permissible, whether he asks a few questions or many.""(At-Tamhid\xa0 21/292).\nHence we encourage you not to hesitate to ask questions in order to understand what you do not understand of religious matters.\nMay Allah help us and you to learn the truth and adhere steadfastly to it.\nII.\nAllah, may He be exalted, has commanded us to disavow disbelief (kufr) and its people, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{There has already been for you an excellent pattern in Abraham and those with him, when they said to their people, “Indeed, we are disassociated from you and from whatever you worship other than Allah . We have denied you, and there has appeared between us and you animosity and hatred forever until you believe in Allah alone”}\xa0[al-Mumtahanah 60:4]\n{You will not find a people who believe in Allah and the Last Day having affection for those who oppose Allah and His Messenger, even if they were their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their kindred. Those - He has decreed within their hearts faith and supported them with spirit from Him. And We will admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they abide eternally. Allah is pleased with them, and they are pleased with Him - those are the party of Allah. Unquestionably, the party of Allah - they are the successful}\xa0[al-Mujadilah 58:22]\n{O you who have believed, do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies. They are [in fact] allies of one another. And whoever is an ally to them among you - then indeed, he is [one] of them. Indeed, Allah guides not the wrongdoing people}\xa0[al-Ma’idah 5:51].\nAnd He has enjoined us to love faith and take people of faith as allies, as He, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And hold firmly to the rope of Allah all together and do not become divided. And remember the favor of Allah upon you - when you were enemies and He brought your hearts together and you became, by His favor, brothers. And you were on the edge of a pit of the Fire, and He saved you from it. Thus does Allah make clear to you His verses that you may be guided}\xa0[Al ‘Imran 3:103].\nThe Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The strongest bond of faith is loving for the sake of Allah and hating for the sake of Allah.” Narrated by Ahmad (18524); classed as hasan by the commentators on al-Musnad. It was also classed as hasan by al-Albani in Sahih at-Targhib (3030).\nIt was narrated from Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There are three characteristics, whoever attains them has found the sweetness of faith: when Allah and His Messenger are dearer to him than all else, when he loves a man and does not love him except for the sake of Allah, and when he would hate to return to disbelief as he would hate to be thrown into the fire.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (16) and Muslim (43).\nIII.\nWhat is stated above does not mean that there cannot be some kind of love or affection for some reason between a Muslim and an individual disbeliever, either because of ties through kinship or marriage, or because of some kindness or favour, and the like, whilst still disavowing his religion and being opposed to him in that regard.\nAllah, may He be exalted, affirmed the love of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) for his paternal uncle Abu Talib, even though he was a disbeliever. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Indeed, [O Muhammad], you do not guide whomever you love}\xa0[al-Qasas 28:56].\nThat love was something natural that stemmed from ties of kinship.\nAllah has permitted marriage to kitabi [Jewish or Christian] women, even though marriage leads to love between the spouses, as He, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{He created for you from yourselves mates that you may find tranquillity in them; and He placed between you affection and mercy}\xa0[ar-Rum 30:21].\nThis love is something natural and instinctive, like love of food, drink, clothing and the like; it does not rule out religious enmity in the presence of a natural type of love, because these two things stem from different causes.\nThe analogy for that is medicine: the patient may both love and hate the medicine, which he loves in one way [because it alleviates his symptoms] and hates in another way [because it is bitter and unpleasant].\nSee the answers to questions no. 256706 and 154606 .\nIV.\nOnce we understand that it is possible to love a specific person because of ties of kinship, or because of his kindness and the like, and at the same time disavow his disbelief or oppose him because of that, the real test comes when there seems to be a contradiction between these two types of love.\nHence Allah warned His believing slaves against giving precedence to this natural kind of love and inclination over love that is based on faith and Islamic teachings.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{O you who have believed, do not take your fathers or your brothers as allies if they have preferred disbelief over belief. And whoever does so among you - then it is those who are the wrongdoers.\nSay, [O Muhammad], “If your fathers, your sons, your brothers, your wives, your clan, wealth which you have obtained, commerce wherein you fear decline, and dwellings with which you are pleased are more beloved to you than Allah and His Messenger and jihad in His cause, then wait until Allah brings about His decree (of punishment). And Allah does not guide the defiantly disobedient people”}\xa0[at-Tawbah 9:23-24].\nShaykh as-Sa‘di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n{O you who have believed} , act in accordance with the requirements of your faith, by taking as allies those who adhere to it and regarding as enemies those who do not do so\n{do not take your fathers or your brothers as allies} they are the closest of people to you, so it is even more appropriate that you should not take as allies other people {if they have preferred disbelief over belief} that is, they willingly choose disbelief over faith.\n{And whoever does so among you - then it is those who are the wrongdoers} because they have transgressed and disobeyed Allah, by taking His enemies as allies. The basis of alliance is love and support; by taking them as allies, this implies giving precedence to obeying them over obedience to Allah and giving precedence to loving them over loving Allah and His Messenger.\nThe reason why they are wrongdoers is that love of Allah and His Messenger should be given precedence over love of all others, and everything else should be secondary to them. Hence Allah says:\n{Say, [O Muhammad], “If your fathers} and, by the same token, mothers\n{your sons, your brothers} in lineage and kinship\n{your wives, your clan} that is, your relatives in general\n{wealth which you have obtained} that is, that you have earned and toiled for. This is singled out for mention because people are more attached to it and more careful with it than wealth that comes to them without effort or striving.\n{commerce wherein you fear decline} that is, you fear that the prices of goods will drop or that they will be lost. This includes all kinds of trade and earnings, such as trade goods, vessels, weapons, furniture, grains, farmland, livestock and so on.\n{dwellings with which you are pleased} because of their beauty and adornment, and because they suit your desires\nIf these things {are more beloved to you than Allah and His Messenger and jihad in His cause}, then you are transgressors and wrongdoers.\n{then wait} and watch out for that which will befall you of punishment\n{until Allah brings about His decree (of punishment)} which cannot be put back\n{And Allah does not guide the defiantly disobedient people} that is, those who fail to obey Him and give precedence to any of the things mentioned above over love of Allah.\nThis verse provides the greatest evidence for the obligation to love Allah and His Messenger, and to give them precedence over love of anything else. It also provides evidence for the stern warning and certain wrath for the one to whom any of these things is dearer than Allah and His Messenger, and jihad in His cause.\nThe sign of that is that if a person is presented with two options, one of which is loved by Allah and His Messenger, but he has no inclination towards it, and the other option is something that he loves and desires, but it will cause him to miss out on or will detract from the thing that is loved by Allah and His Messenger, if he gives precedence to that which he himself desires over that which Allah loves, this indicates that he is a wrongdoer who is not doing what he should do.""(Taysir al-Karim al-Mannan\xa0 332).\nV.\nDisavowing and resenting the disbeliever is not because of his lineage, homeland, colour or image; rather it is because of the disbelief that he follows and his opposition to the religion of Allah.\nThere is no contradiction between that and loving for him to be guided; rather this is how all the Messengers and believing slaves of Allah were with their people. They disavowed what their people believed in of associating others with Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, and for theirbeing far away from His religion and rejecting His Messengers. At the same time, they loved for them to be guided and enter the religion of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted.\nIt was narrated from Ibn ‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “O Allah, support Islam with the dearer of these two men to You: Abu Jahl or ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab.” And the dearer of them to Him was ‘Umar. This is a hasan sahih gharib hadith narrated from Ibn ‘Umar. It was narrated by at-Tirmidhi (3681) and classed as sahih by al-Albani.\n‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: It is as if I can see the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), telling the story of one of the Prophets who was beaten by his people, causing him to bleed, and he wiped the blood from his face, saying: “O Allah forgive my people, for they do not know.”\nNarrated by al-Bukhari (3477) and Muslim (1792).\nThink about the following story; you will see how enmity on the basis of religion, even on the part of a disbeliever, may turn into love on the basis of faith when the disbeliever enters the religion of Allah and gives up the disbelief that he has been following:\nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said:\nThe Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) sent some cavalry towards Najd, and they captured a man of Banu Hanifah who was called Thumamah ibn Uthal, the leader of the people of Yamamah. They tied him to one of the pillars of the mosque, then the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came out to him and said: “What do you have to say, O Thumamah?”\nHe said: I shall say something good, O Muhammad. If you kill me, you will kill one who has shed blood, and if you show me kindness, you will be showing kindness to one who is grateful, and if you want money, then ask, and you will be given whatever you want.\nHe was left alone until the next day, then he said: “What do you have to say, O Thumamah?”\nHe said: What I said to you: if you show me kindness, you will be showing kindness to one who is grateful. [The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)] left him alone until the next day, then he said: “What do you have to say, O Thumamah?”\nHe said: I say what I already said to you.\n[The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)] said: “Let Thumamah go.”\nSo he went to some date palms that were near the mosque, and washed himself (ghusl), then he entered the mosque and said: I bear witness that there is no god worthy of worship except Allah and I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.\nO Muhammad, by Allah, there was no face on earth that was more hateful to me than your face, but now your face has become the dearest of all faces to me.\nBy Allah, there was no religion that was more hateful to me than your religion, but now your religion has become the dearest of all religions to me.\nBy Allah, there was no city on earth that was more hateful to me than your city, but now your city has become the dearest of all cities to me.\nYour cavalry seized me when I was intending to do ‘umrah. What do you think? The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) gave him glad tidings and told him to do ‘umrah...\nNarrated by al-Bukhari (4372) and Muslim (1764).\nIV.\nIt should be noted and affirmed that combining these two matters – namely disavowal of shirk and its people, and showing compassion towards people for the sake of Allah, loving for them to believe and striving to bring them all to the religion of Allah – is one of the main reasons why this ummah is described as being the best, for which Allah praises them.\nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said regarding the verse {You are the best nation produced [as an example] for mankind} [Al ‘Imran 3:110]:\nThe best of mankind for mankind; you bring them with chains on their necks, then they enter Islam. Narrated by al-Bukhari (4557).\nThink about the story of this believing slave, and what happened to him with his disbelieving people, who rejected and denied the truth, and how he strove to guide them, but they rejected him and what he called them to, until they killed him. Yet despite that, he hoped that the outcome for them would be good and that they would ultimately be guided, even after he died:\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And there came from the farthest end of the city a man, running. He said, “O my people, follow the messengers.\nFollow those who do not ask of you [any] payment, and they are [rightly] guided.\nAnd why should I not worship Him who created me and to whom you will be returned?\nShould I take other than Him [false] deities [while], if the Most Merciful intends for me some adversity, their intercession will not avail me at all, nor can they save me?\nIndeed, I would then be in manifest error.\nIndeed, I have believed in your Lord, so listen to me.”\nIt was said, “Enter Paradise.” He said, “I wish my people could know\nOf how my Lord has forgiven me and placed me among the honored”}\xa0[Ya-Sin 36:20-27].\nQatadah said: They started stoning him whilst he was saying: O Allah, guide my people, for they do not know. But they kept stoning him until they caused him to fall to the ground whilst he was saying that, then they killed him; may Allah have mercy on him.\xa0Tafsir Ibn Kathir (6/571).\nThink about what Allah tells us about the believer among the family of Pharaoh, and how he disavowed his people and called them to salvation, despite their disbelief, rejection and denial. His story is told at length in Surat Ghafir, which is also known as Surat al-Mu’min (the Believer).\nIn Sahih al-Bukhari (3231) and Sahih Muslim (1795) it is narrated from ‘Urwah that ‘A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), the wife of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), told him that she said to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him):\nO Messenger of Allah, was there ever a day that was worse for you than the day of Uhud?\nHe said: “I suffered a great deal at the hands of your people, and the worst that I suffered from them was on the day of al-‘Aqabah, when I presented myself to Ibn ‘Abd Ya Lil ibn ‘Abd Kulal, and he did not respond to what I wanted. So I left, so distressed that I did not know in which direction I was heading, and I did not realise where I was until I was in Qarn ath-Tha‘alib, where I lifted my head and saw that a cloud was shading me. I looked and saw therein Jibril, who called me and said: Allah has heard what your people said to you, and how they have responded to you. Allah has sent to you the angel of the mountains, so that you can tell him to do whatever you want to them. Then the angel of the mountains called out to me; he greeted me with salaam, then said: O Muhammad! Then he said: Tell me what you want; if you wish, I will crush them between the two mountains.\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Rather I hope that Allah will bring forth from their loins people who will worship Allah alone, not associating anything with Him.”\nAnd Allah, may He be exalted, said, addressing His Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him):\n{And We have not sent you, [O Muhammad], except as a mercy to the worlds}\xa0[al-Anbiya’ 21:107].\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThis verse tells us that Allah, may He be exalted, has made Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) a mercy to the worlds. In other words, He sent him as a mercy to them all, so whoever accepts this mercy and give thanks for this blessing will be blessed in this world and the hereafter, and whoever rejects it and denies it will be a loser in this world and the hereafter…\nMuslim said in his Sahih: … It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: It was said: O Messenger of Allah, pray against the polytheists. He said: “I was not sent as one who curses; rather I was sent as a mercy.”(Tafsir Ibn Kathir\xa0 5/385).\nPlease see also the answer to question no. 224598 .\nVII.\nWe hope that the answer we have given above is sufficient, as a fair and objective examination of people’s lives, psychology and history indicates that very clearly.\nBut we invite you to reflect on this combination of the two issues that appears at the beginning of Surat al-Mumtahinah: affirmation of the principle of disavowing shirk and its people, and the believers not despairing of the disbelievers being guided and entering the religion of Allah, turning this enmity into love that is based on faith. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{O you who have believed, do not take My enemies and your enemies as allies, extending to them affection while they have disbelieved in what came to you of the truth, having driven out the Prophet and yourselves [only] because you believe in Allah, your Lord. If you have come out for jihad in My cause and seeking means to My approval, [take them not as friends]. You confide to them affection, but I am most knowing of what you have concealed and what you have declared. And whoever does it among you has certainly strayed from the soundness of the way.\nIf they gain dominance over you, they would be to you as enemies and extend against you their hands and their tongues with evil, and they wish you would disbelieve.\nNever will your relatives or your children benefit you; the Day of Resurrection He will judge between you. And Allah, of what you do, is Seeing.\nThere has already been for you an excellent pattern in Abraham and those with him, when they said to their people, “Indeed, we are disassociated from you and from whatever you worship other than Allah. We have denied you, and there has appeared between us and you animosity and hatred forever until you believe in Allah alone” - except for the saying of Abraham to his father, “I will surely ask forgiveness for you, but I have not [power to do] for you anything against Allah. Our Lord, upon You we have relied, and to You we have returned, and to You is the destination.\nOur Lord, make us not [objects of] torment for the disbelievers and forgive us, our Lord. Indeed, it is You who is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.”\nThere has certainly been for you in them an excellent pattern for anyone whose hope is in Allah and the Last Day. And whoever turns away - then indeed, Allah is the Free of need, the Praiseworthy.\nPerhaps Allah will put, between you and those to whom you have been enemies among them, affection. And Allah is competent, and Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.\nAllah does not forbid you from those who do not fight you because of religion and do not expel you from your homes - from being righteous toward them and acting justly toward them. Indeed, Allah loves those who act justly.\nAllah only forbids you from those who fight you because of religion and expel you from your homes and aid in your expulsion - [forbids] that you make allies of them. And whoever makes allies of them, then it is those who are the wrongdoers}\xa0[al-Mumtahinah 60:1-9].\nWe hope that we have been able to answer the issue that has been bothering you. If you have any other questions, or there is anything on your mind that we have not answered here, then please feel free to contact us again and learn more about what we need to know about our religion.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/257654/ruling-on-loving-non-muslims
221753,What is the ruling on using things made from the skins of animals?,"['Praise be to Allah.Animal skins are used to make many things, such as handbags, coats, shoes, belts, and so on.\n“Artificial leather” – whether it is made from petroleum by-products or other materials – is permissible and is pure (tahir), because the basic principle regarding things is that they are pure and permissible.\nAs for things that are made from the skins of animals, the ruling differs according to the animal from whose skin they are made.\nThere are several scenarios when it comes to animal skins:\n1.\xa0If the skin comes from an animal whose meat is permissible to eat, and it was slaughtered in the manner prescribed in Islamic teachings,\nthen this skin is pure according to scholarly consensus, because it was rendered pure by means of proper slaughter, such as the skins of camels, cattle, sheep, deer, rabbits and so on, regardless of whether the skin has been tanned or not.\nIbn Hazm (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The scholars are unanimously agreed that the skin of animals whose meat is permissible to eat, if it is slaughtered in the prescribed manner, is pure and it is permissible to use it and sell it.""(Maratib al-Ijma‘ p. 23).\n2.\xa0If the skin comes from an animal whose meat is permissible to eat, but the animal was not slaughtered in the manner prescribed in Islamic teachings – rather it either died of natural causes or it was slaughtered, but in a way that is not prescribed in Islamic teachings,\nthen in this case the skin is impure (najis), because it is part of an animal that died of natural causes and the like, and such a dead animal is impure, and it can only be purified by means of tanning. Once it has been tanned, it becomes pure.\nTanning means: treating the skin with detergents and antiseptics to remove any stench, rottenness and moisture in it. For that purpose they used to use mimosa flava leaves, galls, shabb plants [a type of fragrant plant], and pomegranate skins…\nIn modern times, tanning is done in large factories using some chemical substances that cleanse the skin and this serves the same purpose. … Tanning may be done using anything that removes the stench and impurities from the skin.\nAll the skins that are used nowadays in handbags, clothing, shoes and so on have been tanned and cleansed of moisture and blood.\nThe fact that animal skins are purified by tanning is indicated by the report narrated by Muslim (366) from Abu’l-Khayr, which states that he asked ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him): We live in the west (al-maghrib) and with us there are Berbers and Magians who bring us a ram that they have slaughtered, but we do not eat their meat. And they bring us skins in which they put fat. Ibn ‘Abbas said: We asked the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) about that and he said: “Its tanning is its purification.”\nAnd Muslim (363) also narrated from Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: A sheep was given in charity to a freed slave woman of Maymunah, but it died. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) passed by it and said: “Why don’t you take its hide and tan it, and make use of it?” They said: It is dead, O Messenger of Allah (i.e., it died of natural causes and was not slaughtered properly). He said: “It is only haram to eat it.”\nThis indicates that the skin of an animal whose meat is permissible to eat [if it is slaughtered properly] that died of natural causes may be purified by tanning.\nIbn Battal (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThis is the view of the majority of scholars and muftis. Ibn al-Qassar stated that the latter is the view of Malik, and it is also the view of Abu Hanifah and ash-Shafa‘i.""(Sharh Sahih al-Bukhari\xa0 5/441).\n3.If it is the skin of a carnivore, such as the skin of a lion, tiger, leopard, wolf, bear, jackal or weasel,\nthe skins of these animals are impure, regardless of whether they were slaughtered, died of natural causes, or were killed, because even if they are slaughtered in the proper manner, they do not become halal or permissible. Therefore they are impure in all circumstances.\nThe scholars differed as to whether tanning makes the skins of these animals pure or not.\nRegardless of whether we say that the skins of these animals become pure through tanning or not, it is not permissible to use them in either case, because of the sahih texts which state that it is not allowed to use them.\nThis is indicated by the report which was narrated from Abu’l-Malih from his father, according to which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade using the skins of carnivores as furnishings. Narrated by at-Tirmidhi (1771); classed as sahih by an-Nawawi and al-Albani.\nAnd it was narrated from al-Miqdam ibn Ma‘di Karib that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade wearing the skins of carnivores and riding on them [by placing them under saddles]. Narrated by Abu Dawud (4131); classed as sahih by al-Albani.\nThese hadiths indicate that it is not permissible to make use of the skins of carnivores at all.\nAt-Tirmidhi said: Some of these scholars among the Companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and others said that they regarded it as disliked (makruh) to use the skins of carnivores even if they have been tanned. This is the view of ‘Abdullah ibn al-Mubarak, Ahmad and Ishaq, and they strictly forbade wearing them and praying in them.""(Sunan at-Tirmidhi 1771).\nOne of the scholars said: The prohibition on the skins of carnivores refers to using them before they are tanned.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This is a weak view, because there is no point in singling out the skins of carnivore for mention in that case; rather that applies equally to all animal skins.""(Al-Majmu‘ Sharh al-Muhadhdhab 1/221).\nThe reason for the prohibition on using these skins is what that involves of pride and arrogance, and because it is resembling the tyrants, and because it is the clothing of those who live a life of luxury and extravagance.\nBased on that, it is not permissible to use them, regardless of whether we say that the skins become pure through tanning or not.\nPlease see the answer to question no. 9022 .\n4.If it is the skin of a non-carnivorous animal whose meat is not permissible to eat, such as the skins of snakes, elephants, donkeys, monkeys, pigs and so on,\nthe skins of these and similar animals are impure, regardless of whether they were slaughtered, died of natural causes, or were killed, because even if they are slaughtered in the proper manner, they do not become halal or permissible. Therefore they are impure in all circumstances.\nBut if these skins are tanned, do they become pure? There is a difference of opinion among the scholars regarding this matter.\nIt was said that tanning purifies all kinds of skins, except the skins of dogs and pigs.\nThis view, as Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said, is the view of the majority of jurists among ahl ar-ra’y [scholars who derive rulings on the basis of analogy] and ahl al-athar [scholars who base rulings on reports] in the Hijaz, Iraq and Syria.""(Al-Istidhkar 5/295).\nThis view is also indicated by the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him: “If the hide is tanned it has become pure” (narrated by Muslim (366)); and “Any hide that is tanned has become pure” (narrated by at-Tirmidhi (1728); classed as sahih by al-Bukhari and at-Tirmidhi).\nThe word ihab (translated here as hide) refers to the skin before it is tanned; it is a general word which refers to all kinds of animal skins.\nExcluded from that are the skins of dogs and pigs, because they are both impure when alive, and if being alive – which is stronger than tanning in terms of purification – does not make them pure, then it is more appropriate to say that tanning does not make them pure.\nTanning removes the cause of impurity, which is moisture and blood.""(Al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah\xa0 20/230).\nDogs and pigs are both impure in and of themselves, meaning that the entire animal with all its parts is impure whether it is alive or dead, so they are not impure because of any blood or moisture that there is in them – as in the case of any other dead animals. Therefore they cannot be purified.""(Al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah 20/230).\nIbn ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), “Any hide that has been tanned has become pure” include all types of animal skins, but the majority of the early generations were unanimously agreed that the skin of a pig is not included in that.""(At-Tamhid\xa0 4/178).\nAnd he (may Allah have mercy on him) also said: With regard to the words “Any hide that has been tanned has become pure”, they refer to all hides, which are all kinds of animal skins, because the wording is general in meaning, and does not refer to anything specific … This is the view of the majority of scholars and muftis, with the exception of the skin of a pig, which is not included in the general meaning of the words “Any hide that has been tanned has become pure”, because it is prohibited in and of itself, whether alive or dead, and its skin is like its flesh. Just as its flesh and skin cannot become pure even if it is slaughtered in the proper manner, tanning also cannot purify its hide.""(Al-Istidhkar\xa0 5/305).\nThe second view is that tanning only purifies the skins of animals whose meat is permissible to eat. As for animals whose meat is not permissible to eat, the skins cannot be purified by tanning. This is the view of al- Awza‘i and it is one view that was narrated from Imam Ahmad. It is also the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) in one of his two views.\nSee: Sharh Sahih Muslim by an-Nawawi (4/54); al-Quru‘ by Ibn Muflih (1/102); Majmu‘ al-Fatawa by Ibn Taymiyah (21/95).\nThis view was also favoured by a number of contemporary scholars, such as Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibrahim, Shaykh Ibn Baz, and Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on them all).\nThey quoted as evidence the hadith of Salamah ibn al-Muhabbiq, according to which the Prophet of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), during the Tabook campaign, called for water that a woman had. She said: I have nothing except what is in a waterskin made from an animal that died of natural causes. He said: “Didn’t you tan it?” She said: Of course. He said: “Then tanning it is the same as slaughtering it.” Narrated by at-Tirmidhi (4245); classed as sahih by ad-Daraqutni, an-Nawawi and al-Albani.\nThus he likened tanning to slaughtering in the prescribed manner, and slaughtering in the prescribed manner is only done in the case of animals whose meat is permissible to eat.""(Al-Mughni by Ibn Qudamah\xa0 1/94).\nAs for making use of things that are made from the skins of animals whose meat is not permissible to eat, there are different scholarly views. Those scholars who think that tanning purifies the skin regard it as permissible to make use of these skins, whereas those who think that tanning does not purify the skins of animals whose meat is not permissible to eat do not regard it as permissible to make use of these skins, or to sit on them or use them in any way.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: What is the guideline on using animal skins or leather; what is halal in that regard and what is haram?\nHe said: It is well known that the leather available in the market is animal skins that have been tanned, and according to many of the scholars, animal skins that have been tanned are pure, even if they come from an animal that is impure.\nThe correct view is that they are not pure if they come from animals that are impure, because that which is impure in and of itself cannot become pure, even if it is washed with the water of the entire sea.\nHowever, if the skin came from an animal that is permissible to eat, but you do not know whether the animal was slaughtered in the proper manner or died in another way, then that should not concern you, because even if the skin came from an animal that died of natural causes and the like, or from an animal that was slaughtered in a manner other than that which is prescribed in Islamic teachings, then if it was tanned, it has become pure, like some kinds of fur coats, which are lined with leather made from the skins of young sheep. We say wear them, and there is no blame on you, even if we assume that they came from animals that died of natural causes and the like, or from animals that were slaughtered in a manner other than that which is prescribed in Islamic teachings, because if they have been tanned, they have become pure.""(Liqa’ al-Bab al-Maftuh).\nSee also the answer to question no. 1695 .\nConclusion:\nThere is nothing wrong with using things made from the skins of animals whose meat is permissible to eat. As for those which are made from the skins of carnivores, it is not permissible to use them at all.\nAs for that which is made from the skins of animals whose meat is not permissible to eat, it is better not to use them, because there is a strong difference of scholarly opinion concerning that.\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Undoubtedly it is permissible to use the tanned skins of dead animals that would \xa0have become permissible to eat if they had been slaughtered in the prescribed manner, such as camels, cattle and sheep, for all purposes, according to the most correct scholarly view.\nAs for the skins of pigs, dogs and other animals that do not become permissible to eat even if they are slaughtered properly, then there is a difference of scholarly opinion as to whether they can be purified through tanning. The most prudent option is to refrain from using them, acting in accordance with the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “Whoever avoids dubious matters will have protected his faith and his honour” and “Leave that which makes you doubt for that which does not make you doubt.”""(Majmu‘ Fatawa Ibn Baz\xa0 6/354).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/221753/what-is-the-ruling-on-using-things-made-from-the-skins-of-animals
