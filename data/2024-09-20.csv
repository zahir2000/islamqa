434462,"What is the benefit of a woman’s emotions, other than the benefit that her children gain from that, and her being merciful and compassionate towards them?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nEmotions, feelings and the compassionate side of humans: all of that is one of the greatest blessings that Allah has bestowed on humankind. Were it not for that, we would be like robots, in which case life would have no meaning, blessings would have no meaning and nothing would have any meaning. You would feel no joy, no happiness, no mercy, no compassion, no sympathy and no care for others; you would not forgive others or overlook their mistakes. In fact, you would not feel any grief or pain, and you would not feel pleased or angry.\nAll these feelings, even grief and anger, play an essential role in the soul of the human being and in his entire life.\nHence the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would get angry if the sacred limits of Allah were transgressed. Were it not for feelings of anger, he would not have been able to do that which reflected his faith (namely his righteous anger in this instance).\nSecondly:\nEmotions make life colourful and give it meaning. Emotions are an essential part of our lives, and from them we acquire some important information about ourselves. They are essential to our survival, because they are what enable us to determine what is safe for others and what is dangerous.\nThe one who reflects on people’s emotions will find that emotions are not all the same. Each emotion has several components which may vary in importance; they are seen in a person’s feelings, behaviour and choice of friends, and also in different social contexts in which emotional responses are provoked.\nThirdly:\nIt seems from the question that you affirm the benefit of a woman’s emotions, through which a mother shows mercy and compassion towards her child, and feels love for him. But this in fact highlights to us the more important matter, which is ignored with regard to the benefit of emotions, for emotions are an essential means of showing mercy and compassion to ourselves, being kind to ourselves and being able to handle our feelings and emotions, so that we will be able to manage our mental state and behaviour properly. All of that will lead a person to develop what he requires of characteristics through which he will become a slave of Allah and closer to Him. There is nothing that Allah has given us but it has a role to play in helping us to become true slaves of Allah.\nHow could we love Allah, if we had no feelings of love?\nHow could we give thanks to Allah, if we had no feelings of gratitude?\nHow could we become angry when the sacred limits of Allah are transgressed, if we had no feelings of anger?\nHow could we show mercy to others, if we had no kind and gentle feelings? For the one who does not show mercy will not be shown mercy.\nAllah has created the woman to have feelings and emotions which balance out the man’s logical and practical approach to life, so that he will find comfort in her despite her gentleness and weakness, when he has power and strength: {It is He Who created you from a single soul, and created from it its mate, so that he might find comfort in her} [Al-A‘raf 7:189].\nIn general, human emotions are an inseparable part of a person’s makeup, which help him to go through the journey of life, worshipping his Lord. Female emotions in particular are part of a woman’s makeup which qualify her to be the gentle breeze that brings comfort to life, so as to show one aspect of servitude to Allah in which various branches of faith are manifested, which do not manifest themselves in this way but you will find that in women.\nThe Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) spoke the truth when he said of Khadijah (may Allah be pleased with her): “I was blessed with her love.” Narrated by Muslim (2435).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/434462/what-is-the-benefit-of-a-womans-emotions
146675,"I pray quickly, i.e., I recite Surat Al-Fatihah and other short Surahs quickly, and my movements during the prayer are also fast. Is this permissible or not?","['Praise be to Allah.Shaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him)\xa0 said:\nSignificance of Measured Recitation in Islam\nThe Sunnah is for the one who is reciting to recite at a measured pace (Tartil) and not to rush, so that he may ponder and think about what he is reciting, whether it is Al-Fatihah or something else. The Sunnah is to ponder, think and recite at a measured pace, not to rush. Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n{And recite the Quran (aloud) in a slow, (pleasant tone and) style.} [Al-Muzzammil 73:4]\xa0\n{(This is) a Book (the Quran) which We have sent down to you, full of blessings, that they may ponder over its Verses, and that men of understanding may remember.} [Sad 38:29]\xa0\nReading so fast that some letters or verses are not pronounced properly is not permissible; rather the worshipper should recite slowly and not be hasty, so that the recitation will be correct and clear, and he can ponder and think about (what he is reciting).\xa0\nIf he omits or changes some of the letters, this is a kind of recitation that is not permissible. Rather he has to recite carefully and at a measured pace, so that the letters and words are pronounced in full.\xa0\nIs praying fast prohibited?\nThe same applies to prayer, he should not rush when bowing or prostrating, or when sitting between the two prostrations, or when standing after bowing. Rather he should move with deliberation and calmly . This is what is required. Moving calmly is an essential obligation; “pecking” and moving hastily in prayer invalidates the prayer.\xa0\nRecommended supplications during prayer\nWe advise the questioner to move carefully and calmly when bowing, and not to rush; he should say Subhana Rabbiya Al-`AdhIim three or more times, and he should say: Subhanaka Allahumma wa bi hamdika, Allahumma ighfir li (Glory be to You, O Allah, and praise; O Allah, forgive me). When he raises his head from bowing he should settle into the standing posture and say: Rabbana wa lakal-hamd, hamdan kathiran tayyiban mubarakan fihi mil’a As-Samawati wa mil’a Al-Ard wa mil’a ma baynahuma wa mil’a ma shi’ta min shay’in ba`d (Our Lord, to You be praise, much good and blessed praise, filling the heavens, filling the earth, filling what is between them and filling whatever You will besides). This is what is best for him.\xa0\nSaying Rabbana wa lakal-hamd is obligatory according to the correct opinion. If he completes it by saying hamdan kathiran tayyiban mubarakan fihi mil’a As-Samawati wa mil’a Al-Ard wa mil’a ma baynahuma wa mil’a ma shi’ta min shay’in ba`d, that is more complete and better.\xa0\nAnd some extra words were narrated from the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “Ahl Ath-thana’ wal-majd, ahaqqu ma qala Al-`abd, wa kulluna laka `abd, la mani` lima a`tayta wa la mu`ti lima mana`ta, wa la yanfa`u dhal-jaddi minka Al-jadd (You are the One Who most deserves praise and glorification, (this is) the soundest thing a slave could say, and we are all Your slaves; none can withhold what You give, and none can give what You withhold, and the good fortune of any fortunate person is to no avail against You). This is perfection of praise.\xa0\nSimilarly when prostrating, he should not rush, and he should prostrate on the seven parts: the forehead, the nose, the hands, the knees and the toes; he should settle in the posture and not rush, and he should say Subhan Rabbi Al-A`la, Subhan Rabbi Al-A`la, Subhan Rabbi Al-A`la, subhanaka Allahumma wa bi hamdika Allahumma ighfir li (Glory be to my Lord Most High. Glory be to my Lord Most High, Glory be to my Lord Most High, Glory be to You, O Allah, and praise, O Allah, forgive me).\xa0\nHe should offer whatever supplication he can, and say: Allahumma ighfir li dhanbi kullahu diqqahu wa jullahu, awwalahu wa akhirahu, `alaniyatahu wa sirrahu (O Allah, forgive me all my sins, small and great, first and last, open and secret). This is a prescribed Du`a.\xa0\nAnd the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The closest a person is to his Lord is when he is prostrating, so offer a lot of Du`a then.” And he said: “As for prostration, strive hard in supplication, because it is more likely that you may receive a response.”\xa0\nThe proper way to prostrate and sit in prayer\nThe believer should not rush when prostrating; rather he has to settle in the position, as this is one of the essential parts of prayer and is necessary. Yet it is prescribed not to pause too long (in any position) and not to rush, and he should offer Du`a whilst prostrating and repeat the words Subhana Rabbiya Al-A`la. What is obligatory is to say it once, but repeating it three or five or seven times is better.\xa0\nBetween the two prostrations he should also settle in the posture and not rush. He should sit up between the two prostrations until every vertebra returns to its place, and he should say, Rabb ighfir li, Rabb ighfir li, Rabb ighfir li, Allahumma ighfir li warhamni wahdini wajburni warzuqni wa `afini (Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me, O Allah forgive me, have mercy on me, guide me, comfort me, grant me provision, and grant me well being).\xa0\nAll of that was narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and the Muslim should follow the example of his Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and do as he did, and he should not be hasty in such matters, for prayer is the foundation of Islam and prayer is an important matter.\xa0\nStriving for excellence in prayer\nSo we advise the questioner to pay attention to this matter and to fear Allah and remember that He is always watching; he should do his prayer at a measured pace, and not rush. Similarly, his recitation should be slow and careful, and not rushed; rather he should recite clearly, pondering and thinking about (what he is reciting), and try to benefit from it. We ask Allah to help and guide us all.

13532,"Is it possible to give the Mushrikun (polytheists, those who associate others with Allah) proof of the oneness of Allah?","[""Praise be to Allah.\nThe entire universe, in the way it is created and the way it is controlled, bears witness to the oneness of Allah :\xa0\n\n{Surely, His is the creation and commandment. Blessed is Allah, the Lord of the `Alamin (mankind, jinn and all that exists)} [Al-A`raf 7:54 – interpretation of the meaning]\xa0\n\nThe creation of the heavens and the earth , the alternation of night and day, the different kinds of inanimate objects, plants and fruits, the creation of humans and animals… all of that indicates that the Almighty Creator is One with no partner or associate:\xa0\n\n{That is Allah, your Lord, the Creator of all things, La ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He). How then are you turning away (from Allah, by worshipping others instead of Him)?} [Ghafir 40:62 – interpretation of the meaning]\n\nThe variety and greatness of these created things, the perfect way in which they are formed, the way in which they are maintained and controlled, all indicate that the Creator is One and that He does as He wills and rules and decides as He wants:\xa0\n\n{Allah is the Creator of all things, and He is the Wakil (Trustee, Disposer of affairs, Guardian) over all things.} [Az-Zumar 39:62 – interpretation of the meaning]\xa0\nAll of the above indicate that this universe has a Creator, that this dominion has a Sovereign, that behind these forms is One Who gives them shape:\xa0\n{He is Allah, the Creator, the Inventor of all things, the Bestower of forms. To Him belong the Best Names.} [Al-Hashr 59:24 – interpretation of the meaning]\xa0\n\nThe soundness of the heavens and the earth , the order of the universe, the harmony among created things, all indicate that the Creator is One, with no partner or associate:\xa0\n\n{Had there been therein (in the heavens and the earth) gods besides Allah, then verily, both would have been ruined. Glorified be Allah, the Lord of the Throne, (High is He) above all that (evil) they associate with Him!} [Al-Anbiya’ 21:22 – interpretation of the meaning]\xa0\n\nThese great created things either created themselves – which is impossible – or man created himself then created them – which is also impossible:\xa0\n\n{Were they created by nothing?

Nay, but they have no firm Belief.} [At-Tur 52:35-36 – interpretation of the meaning]\n\nReason, Revelation and the original state of man (Fitrah ) all indicate that this universe has One Who brought it into being, that these created things have a Creator Who is Ever-Living and Eternal, All-Knowing and All-Aware, Powerful and Almighty, Kind and Most Merciful. He has the Most Beautiful Names and Sublime Attributes and He knows all things. Nothing is beyond His control, and there is nothing like unto Him:\xa0\n\n{And your God is One God (Allah), La ilaha illa Huwa (there is none who has the right to be worshipped but He), the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.} [Al-Baqarah 2:163 – interpretation of the meaning]\xa0\nThe existence of Allah is something that is there is no excuse for not knowing. It is the matter of common sense:\xa0\n{Their Messengers said: What! Can there be a doubt about Allah, the Creator of the heavens and the earth?} [Ibrahim 14:10 – interpretation of the meaning]\xa0\nAllah has created people with the natural instinct (Fitrah) to affirm His Lordship and Oneness, but the devils came to the sons of Adam and caused them to deviate from their religion.\xa0\nAccording to a Hadith Qudsi (a type of prophetic narration), “I created all My slaves as Hanifs (monotheists), but the devils came to them and made them deviate from their religion, and they forbade them that which I had permitted to them.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2865)\xa0\nAmong them are those who deny the existence of Allah, and those who worship the devil, and those who worship man. And there are those who worship the dinar [money], or fire, or genital organs, or animals. And there are some who associate in worship with Him a stone from the earth or a star in the sky.\xa0\nThese things which are worshipped instead of Allah, cannot create or provide; they cannot hear or see, or bring benefits or cause harm. So how can they worship them instead of Allah?\xa0\n{Are many different lords (gods) better or Allah, the One, the Irresistible?} [Yusuf 12:39 – interpretation of the meaning]\xa0\nAllah has condemned those who worship these idols which cannot hear, see or think:\xa0\n{Verily, those whom you call upon besides Allah are slaves like you. So call upon them and let them answer you if you are truthful. Have they feet wherewith they walk? Or have they hands wherewith they hold? Or have they eyes wherewith they see? Or have they ears wherewith they hear?} [Al-A`raf 7:194-195 – interpretation of the meaning]\xa0\n{Say (O Muhammad to mankind): ‘How do you worship besides Allah something which has no power either to harm or benefit you? But it is Allah Who is the All-Hearer, All-Knower} [Al-Ma'idah 5:76 – interpretation of the meaning]\xa0\nHow ignorant man is of his Lord Who created him and provides for him. How he rejects Him and forgets Him, and worships others instead of Him:\xa0\n{Verily, it is not the eyes that grow blind, but it is the hearts which are in the breasts that grow blind.} [Al-Hajj 22:46 – interpretation of the meaning]\xa0\nGlorified be Allah far above that which they associate with Him.
