506779,"I am a driver for female teachers, and I am committed to being present during working hours, and I am very punctual and assiduous in my work. One month, after the first week of the month had passed, one of the teachers asked to switch to another driver, even though I did not do anything wrong.","['Praise be to Allah.If the contract between you states that payment is to be made on a monthly basis, then she must pay for the month in full, because the contract of hire is binding on both parties, and the one who does not make use of the service for which he signed the contract is the one who is at fault for no longer making use of the service, so the fee cannot be waived.\nIt says in al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah al-Kuwaitiyyah (1/253):\nThe basic principle regarding contracts of hire, according to the majority of scholars, is that such contracts are binding, and neither party can unilaterally cancel the contract except for a reason on the basis of which a binding contract may be nullified, such as a defect or problem with the item or service in question, or if it can no longer be made use of.\nThey quoted as evidence for that the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {O you who have believed, fulfill [all] contracts} [al-Ma’idah 5:1]. End quote.\nIbn Qudamah said: A contract of hire or rental is a binding contract, which means that the one who is hiring or renting will pay the fee and will make use of the item or service in question. If he cancels the deal before the end of the contract period, and no longer makes use of the item or service in question by his own choice, the contract is not cancelled and the fee is still owed.…\nAl-Athram said: I said to Abu ‘Abdillah (Imam Ahmad): A man hired a camel, then when he came to Madinah, he said to him: Cancel the deal for me. He said: He has no right to do that, and he must pay the fee.""(Al-Mughni\xa0 8/23).\nIt says in al-Ma‘ayir ash-Shar‘iyyah in the section on hiring and renting: It is permissible to cancel a contract of hire or rental with the agreement of both parties, but neither of them has the right to cancel it [unilaterally] except in the case of unforeseen circumstances.\nMoreover, the one who is renting or hiring has the right to cancel because of a fault or defect that appears in the item being rented or hired, which prevents him from making use of it.""(Al-Ma‘ayir ash-Shar‘iyyah, p. 141).\nIf no unforeseen reason arises that prevents making use of the item, and there is no excuse or reason to cancel the contract, then the contract of hire or rental is binding, so long as the driver – in the case mentioned in the question – made himself available to transport the teacher, and committed himself to that in the customary manner, and there was nothing to prevent her from travelling with him.\nThat is reinforced by the fact that the custom in your country is that once the month has begun, if the user of the service did not withdraw from the contract, then the fee must be paid.\nBased on that, the teacher must pay the month’s fee in full, unless you reach an agreement that she will pay for only one week, or less or more than that, and reaching a deal is better.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/506779/if-someone-who-is-renting-or-hiring-some-facility-or-service-stops-making-use-of-it-with-no-excuse-is-he-obliged-to-pay-the-fee-in-full
145105,Muslim female who has been earning since a few years but recently came to know that Qurbani is wajib on her because she is earning. How can she compensate for all those previous years for which she did not offer sacrifice.,"['Praise be to Allah.Is Ud-hiyah obligatory?\nThe scholars (may Allah have mercy on him) differed with regard to the ruling on Ud-hiyah : is it obligatory or Sunnah Mu’akkadah (a confirmed Sunnah)? The correct view is that Ud-hiyah is Sunnah Mu’akkadah for the one who can afford it, but there is no sin on the one who does not do it.\xa0\nWhat happens if you do not offer Ud-hiyah for rears?\xa0\nIf a person does not offer Ud-hiyah although he can afford to do so, he is missing out on a lot of reward that results from offering the sacrifice, but he is not sinning, and he does not have to make up for what he missed in years past, because Ud-hiyah is Sunnah and the time for it has gone. This is the case if he did not make a vow to offer a sacrifice, in which case it is obligatory for him to fulfil his vow and offer Ud-hiyah .\xa0\nIt says in Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah (34/46): “If a person does not offer a sacrifice before the time has passed, if it was a voluntary sacrifice he should not offer it; rather he has missed the opportunity to offer a sacrifice this year. But if it was a vow, he has to offer a sacrifice and make up for what he was obliged to do.”\xa0\nBased on that, if she wants to offer Ud-hiyah , then from now onwards she has to prepare ahead of time, so that when the next `Eid Al-Adh-ha comes, in sha Allah, she will have prepared her sacrifice beforehand, so she will not have missed the time for Ud-hiyah , as happened in the past.\xa0\nWe ask Allah to help us and you to do that which He loves and which pleases Him, and to accept righteous deeds from us and from you.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/145105/what-happens-if-you-do-not-offer-ud-hiyah-for-years
270696,I am very emotionally disturbed and need your advice to save this marriage. Iv been married for 3 years and over the years my husband has lied to me on numerous times for which I have forgiven him. He even cheated on me by talking to an ex girl he wanted to marry once and asked for forgiveness when I found out and repented. Then last year I developed a sexual condition when I went to the dr she told me it\'s sexually transmitted disease that only gets passed on from sex. I asked my husband after that if he has ever been in illegitimate relationship that might be the cause and he swore on Allah that he hasn\'t been. I didn\'t get myself properly screened and treated thinking he is telling the truth. Just recently I found out from another source that he was in 8 year relationship with another woman before he married me and commited zina during that time. When I confronted him he threw a fit and said he hid it yes because I do not need to know what has happened in his past..to a degree I agree with that but I also discovered he had been in contact with her after we got married so made an excuse to say that\'s because that woman owed him money she needed to contact etc. If a person really repents do they still have the right to contact them and then keep that hidden from the wife? I feel so broken and shattered. I married this man thinking he is religious and been pious. I haven\'t shared this with anyone in family yet I can\'t stomach it. I feel like I cannot trust this man anymore,"['Praise be to Allah.The conditions of repentance are three: regret for past sin, giving up present sin, and resolving not to go back to that sin in the future. One of the signs of this resolve is closing all doors that lead to that sin and barring all means that could lead to it.\nBased on that: it is not permissible for the one who was communicating with a woman in a way that is prohibited according to Islamic teachings to continue communicating with her under any circumstances. Rather what he must do is close every door that could lead to that. For him, this is the first correct step on the way to repentance, if he is serious about repenting and turning to the Lord of the Worlds.\nOur advice to you, if you want to preserve your marriage, is to be patient with your husband and try to help him to close those doors and try to prevent him from communicating with this woman by all possible means. You can give him another chance to repent and mend his ways, and warn him against not being serious about repentance, messing about with it and breaking his promise to the Lord of the Worlds. You should exhort him and warn him about the evil of these filthy things, the impact they have on a person and the negative consequences to which they will lead in his religious and worldly affairs. The person who sincerely cares about himself should be careful, lest he be disgraced in this world and punished in the hereafter, for Allah may grant respite but He does not forget:\n{So whoever does an atom’s weight of good will see it,\nAnd whoever does an atom’s weight of evil will see it}\xa0[az-Zalzalah 99:7-8].\nIf you can sit with him and have a calm discussion, to try to find out the reasons and motives for his communicating with that woman, we hope that that will be good for both of you.\nUndoubtedly whether he is sincere and serious about committing to that will show on him. If he is serious about that, is sincere in his repentance and is keen to protect his marriage, then stay with him and try to protect your marriage too; strive to forget the past and help him against his own nafs and his shaytan with regard to the future.\nBut if it is otherwise, and he goes back to his old ways, starts to mess around, breaks his promises and carries on in that way, then there is nothing good for you in such a man.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/270696/how-can-i-protect-my-marriage-from-collapse
