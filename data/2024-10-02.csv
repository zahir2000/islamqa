302845,Why has Allah appointed certain angels to do tasks when he (s.w.t) can do it himself? Asking out of curiosity,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nOne of the basic principles of faith is belief in the noble angels, and belief that Allah, may He be exalted, has appointed each angel to do a certain task. That includes managing some matters of this universe. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And those who arrange [each] matter}\xa0[Az-Nazi`at 79:5].\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nRegarding the words {And those who arrange [each] matter}, `Ali, Mujahid, `Ata’, Abu Salih, al-Hasan, Qatadah, ar-Rabi` ibn Anas and as-Suddi said: This refers to the angels. Al-Hasan added: They arrange [each] matter from the heaven to the earth; that is, on the command of their Lord, may He be glorified and exalted. There is no difference of scholarly opinion regarding that. (End quote from Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 8/313).\nShaykh ‘Abd ar-Rahman as-Sa‘di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n{And those who arrange [each] matter} are the angels, whom Allah has appointed to arrange many matters in the upper and lower realms, such as rain, plants, trees, winds, seas, foetuses, animals, paradise, hell and so on. (End quote from Tafsir as-Sa‘di, p. 908).\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nEvery movement in the heavens and on earth, including the movement of planets, stars, the sun, the moon, winds, clouds, plants and animals, is initiated by the angels who are appointed in charge of the heavens and the earth, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {And those who arrange [each] matter} [az-Nazi`at 79:5] and {And the [angels] apportioning [each] matter} [adh-Dhariyat 51:4]. These verses refer to the angels, according to those who believe and follow the messengers (peace be upon them)…\nThe Qur’an and Sunnah indicate that there are different types of angels, and that they are appointed in charge of different types of created things. Allah, may He be glorified, has appointed angels in charge of the mountains, and has appointed angels in charge of the clouds and rain. He has appointed angels in charge of the wombs, who manage the affairs of the fertilised egg until its creation is completed, then He appoints angels to protect the person, and angels to record his deeds and write them down. He has appointed angels in charge of death, and has appointed angels to question the deceased in the grave. He has appointed angels in charge of heavenly bodies, who control their movements, And He has appointed angels in charge of the sun and moon. He has appointed angels in charge of hell to stoke its flames and punish its occupants, and He has appointed angels in charge of what happens in it. He has appointed angels in charge of paradise and what happens in it, who take care of its plants and rivers.The angels are the greatest of the troops of Allah, may He be exalted. (End quote from Ighathat al-Lahfan, 2/842)\nSecondly:\nEven though Allah, may He be exalted, has appointed the angels to manage some matters of His dominion, their management thereof is by His leave and His command, and they only do what they are commanded to do.\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe word malak (angel) conveys the sense of a messenger who is carrying out the command of someone else. So the angels have no say in anything; rather the command belongs to Allah, the One, the Compeller, alone, and they carry out His command.\n{They do not speak until He has spoken, and they act by His command.\nHe knows what is [presently] before them and what will be after them, and they cannot intercede except on behalf of one whom He approves. And they are filled with reverent awe of Him}\xa0[Al-Anbiya’ 21:27-28]\n{They fear their Lord above them, and they do what they are commanded}\xa0[An-Nahl 16:50]\n{they do not disobey Allah in what He commands them but do what they are commanded}\xa0[At-Tahrim 66:6].\nThey only descend by His command, and they do not do anything except after He has given permission. They are honoured slaves of His. Some of them are the [angels] lined up in rows and some of them are those who glorify Him. There is no one among them but he has an assigned place, beyond which he does not go, and he does the task that he was commanded to do, without falling short or overstepping the mark. (End quote from Ighathat al-Lahfan, 2/843).\nThirdly:\nOne of the things that are definitively proven in Islam is that Allah, may He be exalted, does not do anything except on the basis of ultimate wisdom, whether He has informed us of that or has kept knowledge of it to Himself, may He be glorified and exalted.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about the wisdom behind the creation of the jinn and humankind, and he (may Allah have mercy on him) replied:\nBefore I speak about this matter, I would like to point out a general principle regarding what Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, creates and what He prescribes.\nThis principle is taken from the verses (interpretation of the meaning)\n{and He is the Knowing, the Wise} [at-Tahrim 66:2] and {Indeed, Allah is ever Knowing and Wise} [an-Nisa’ 4:11], and many other verses which affirm that Allah is wise in what He creates and in what He prescribes – that is, in His universal decree and His religious decree. There is nothing that Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, creates but there is wisdom behind it, whether that is when bringing it into existence or when taking it out of existence.\nAnd there is nothing that Allah, may He be exalted, prescribes except there is wisdom behind it, whether that is making something obligatory or prohibited or permissible.\nBut this wisdom on which His universal decree and religious decree are based may be known to us or it may be unknown, or it may be known to some people and not others, commensurate with the level of knowledge and understanding that Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, grants them. (End quote from Majmu` Fatawa ash-Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin, 1/87).\nFourthly:\nThe perfect nature of the wisdom of Allah, may He be exalted, is something that is well established and well known to every Muslim, and submitting to it is one of the fundamentals of faith.\nImam ash-Shafa`i (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Allah enjoined His Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and all other creatures to worship Him in whatever way He willed, as was stated by His Prophet. No one has the right to question why or how, or add his own view to what was narrated from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). (End quote from al-Umm, 10/16).\nKnowing that motivates the Muslim to focus on purifying himself and not let himself be distracted by giving his view on issues that do not bring any benefit; rather they lead to going to extremes in doubts and expose him to intrusive thoughts (waswasah).\nIbn Abi’l-‘Izz al-Hanafi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nYou should understand that the basis of servitude and belief in Allah and His Books and His Messengers is submission and not asking about the details of the wisdom behind the commands, prohibitions and other divine laws.\nHence Allah, may He be glorified, did not tell us that any nation that believed in its prophet and believed in the message he brought to them ever asked him about the details of the wisdom behind what he enjoined them to do and forbade them to do, and what he conveyed to them from their Lord. If they had done that, they would not have been believers in their prophet; rather they accepted the teachings, submitted and surrendered.\nWhatever they learned of the wisdom behind rulings is what they learned, and whatever was hidden from them, their submission and surrender did not depend on knowing that, and the nation never thought that finding out about that wisdom was any of their concern, for they thought too highly of their messenger to ask him about that.\nHence the early generations of this ummah – which is the most perfect of nations in terms of mature thinking, knowledge and understanding – did not ask their Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): Why did Allah enjoin such and such? Why did He forbid such and such? Why did He decree such and such? That was because they knew that asking such questions is contrary to faith and submission, and they could not remain steadfast in their commitment to Islam unless they surrendered…\nAllah, may He be glorified and exalted, is not to be questioned about what He does, because of the perfect nature of His wisdom, mercy and justice, not merely because of His might and power. (End quote from Sharh at-Tahhawiyyah, p. 261-262)\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {And your Lord creates what He wills and chooses; not for them was the choice. Exalted is Allah and high above what they associate with Him} [al-Qasas 28:68].\nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 186418.\nFifthly:\nWhen the Muslim reflects on the actions of the angels, some aspects of the wisdom of Allah, may He be exalted, will become apparent to him.\nAllah’s creation of the angels and their deeds confirms the perfection of His lordship and His divinity. So when the Muslim learns about the immense size of these angels and their large numbers, and the tasks to which they are appointed, yet despite that not one of them disobeys Allah’s command in the slightest – rather they race to obey Him, may He be glorified and exalted – that is indicative of the perfect lordship and divinity of Allah, may He be exalted.\nIf the great number of troops and workers of a king in this world is indicative of his perfect sovereignty and control, and is indicative of the high level of obedience that his subjects show him, then in the case of Allah, may He be exalted, this meaning is demonstrated more clearly by His creation of the noble angels. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And they say, “The Most Merciful has taken a son.” Exalted is He! Rather, they are [but] honored servants.\nThey do not speak until He has spoken, and they act by His command.\nHe knows what is [presently] before them and what will be after them, and they cannot intercede except on behalf of one whom He approves. And they are filled with reverent awe of Him.\nAnd whoever of them should say, “Indeed, I am a god besides Him” – that one We would requite with Hell. Thus do We requite the wrongdoers}\xa0[Al-Anbiya’ 21:26-29].\nMoreover, for the one who studies the texts of the revelation concerning the existence of the angels and the tasks to which they are appointed, that will instil in him perfect fear of Allah, may He be exalted, and at the same time will instil in him perfect love and hope.\nIf he studies the texts of the revelation that speak of the angels of punishment and those who write down people’s deeds, that will increase him in fear of Allah. In contrast, if he studies the texts of the revelation that speak of the angels of mercy and the guardian angels, that will increase him in love for his Lord and hope of His forgiveness. All of this leads to attaining the level of faith that is enjoined upon people.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Only those believe in Our verses who, when they are reminded by them, fall down in prostration and exalt [Allah] with praise of their Lord, and they are not arrogant.\nThey arise from [their] beds; they supplicate their Lord in fear and aspiration, and from what We have provided them, they spend}\xa0[As-Sajdah 32:15-16].\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nBelief in the angels leads to great outcomes, including the following:\n\nKnowledge of Allah’s greatness, power, might and authority, for the greatness of the created being is connected to the greatness of the Creator.\nGratitude to Allah, may He be exalted, for His care towards the children of Adam, as He has appointed some of these angels to protect them, record their deeds and do other things that are in their interests… (End quote from Majmu` al-Fatawa, 6/89).\n\nAnd he (may Allah have mercy on him) said regarding the wisdom behind the creation of the noble scribes (the recording angels), even though Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, knows all things and nothing that we do in secret or in public is hidden from Him:\nThe wisdom behind that is that it highlights the fact that Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has created all things in a system, according to estimates and calculations, and He has perfected it to the extent that He has appointed noble scribes to record the words and deeds of the children of Adam, who write down everything that they do, even though Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, knows what they will do before they do it.\nBut all of that serves to highlight how perfect is the care of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, for man, and it highlights the fact that this universe is put together in the best order and is perfectly designed.

14506,"I live in a non-Muslim country and find some difficulty when the time of prayer comes while I am outside home as there are not always nearby mosques everywhere you go. A lot of sisters (including myself) have no solution but to pray in the fitting rooms of the shops, or sometimes in the nursing rooms where mums change the nappies for their babies. The problem is that sometimes these nursing rooms have a special section (a corner in the room) where there is a toilet for children. Is it OK to pray there away from the toilet, or is it still considered a “Najis” place? Also can a Muslim woman pray in an open park or car parking? I do not feel shy about my religion and I do not care about people seeing me, but I sometimes feel shy when non-Muslims stand and stare as if you are doing a show! I am also worried that it could be haram for a Muslim woman to pray in front of men. We try to avoid these situations as much as we can, but sometimes we cannot. What should a sister do in these situations?","['Praise be to Allah.Can you pray in the bathroom?\nIt was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that it is prohibited to pray in certain places, including bathrooms. It is not permissible to pray in them.\nIt was narrated in an authentic report from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that he said: “All the earth is a mosque except for graveyards and bathrooms.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, As-Salah, 291; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Sunan At-Tirmidhi, 262)\nIs Praying in a Room with a Toilet Permissible?\n“Bathroom” refers to every place that is used for the purpose of relieving oneself; it is not permissible to pray in any such place. This room on the edge of which there is a toilet is not considered to be a bathroom so long as there is a barrier between it and the bathroom, with a wall and door etc.\nIn this case, prayer in that room is valid, because the prohibition on praying in bathrooms is because they are usually impure, and this room is not like that.\nWhat indicates that prayer in this place and elsewhere is valid is the Hadith in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The earth has been made a place of prayer and a means of purification for me, so wherever a man is when the time for prayer comes, let him pray.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, At-Tayammum, 323)\nGuidelines for Women Praying in Public Spaces\nSo prayer in that place is valid, and it is also valid in parks and parking lots, on condition that the place in which one prays is pure.\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked, if there is a bathroom in front of a person in the direction of the Qiblah, is it O.K. to pray facing it?\nHe said:\nThe prayer is valid and there is nothing wrong with that, rather what is forbidden is to pray inside the bathroom.\xa0(End quote from Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn Baz, vol. 2, p. 196)\nOne thing to which attention must be paid is that a woman should uncover her face when praying, especially when she is among other women or her Mahrams. But if she is praying in a place where men can see her, then she should cover her face whilst praying.\nThe Importance of Praying on Time\nSecondly: you will be rewarded, in sha Allah, for your keenness to do the prayers on time. Undoubtedly the Muslim is obliged to do the prayers on time. And you have to make yourself feel that you are obeying Allah when you are praying.\nYour adherence to the truth and your establishing prayer and not feeling shy to worship openly may be the means of guiding some of the non-Muslims who see you to Islam, in which case you will have a reward equal to theirs in sha Allah.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/14506/is-praying-in-a-room-with-a-toilet-permissible%C2%A0

In that case he must change his name. The same applies if it is a name that is uniquely used by the disbelievers, and is not used by anyone else. In that case it must also be changed, so that he will not be resembling the disbelievers, and so that he will not feel attached to this name that belongs only to the disbelievers, and so that no one will think that he has not become Muslim yet.

157606,My colleague is saying that a jinni sometimes appears to his wife in the form of her sister and sometimes in his natural form. Can the jinn appear in Ramadan?,"['Praise be to Allah.Can humans see the Jinn?\nMost scholars are of the view that it is not possible for any human – except the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his fellow Prophets – to see the jinn in their original form, which is not known in the first place.\nSo any statement with certainty that they take a particular form is not something to be believed without question. Those who say that it is not possible to see them in their true form quote as evidence the verse in which Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Verily, he [the devil] and Qabeeluhu (his soldiers from the jinns or his tribe) see you from where you cannot see them.} [Al-A`raf 7:27].\nAsh-Shafi`i (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“If a person who is of good character claims that he sees the jinn, his testimony becomes invalid because Allah, may He be glorified and Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {Verily, he [the devil] and Qabeeluhu (his soldiers from the jinns or his tribe) see you from where you cannot see them} [Al-A ‘raf 7:27] – unless the person who says that is a Prophet.” (End quote from Ahkam Al-Quran, 2/195, 196, by Al-Qurtubi)\nIbn Hazm (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“The jinn are real, and they are part of the creation of Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted. There are disbelievers and believers among them; they can see us but we cannot see them.” (End quote from Al-Muhalla, 1/34)\nThis does not contradict what has been proven of seeing them in the forms of humans or animals; the inability to see them is only applicable to seeing them in their real form.\nAl-Hafidh Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“He – i.e., the devil – may appear in different forms that can be seen. The words of Allah, may He be Exalted, (interpretation of the meaning): {Verily, he [the devil] and Qabiluhu (his soldiers from the jinns or his tribe) see you from where you cannot see them} [Al-A`raf 7:27] – apply only to seeing him in the form in which Allah created him.” (End quote from Fat-h Al-Bari, 4/489)\nCan the Jinn Appear in human form?\nAllah, may He be Exalted, has given the jinn the ability to appear in the form of humans and animals; there is sound evidence to that effect and that is known from real events.\nIt was narrated that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “In Madinah, there are some of the jinn who have become Muslim. Whoever sees any sign of these inhabitants, let him warn him for three days, then if he appears after that let him kill him, for he is a devil.”\nThe word translated above as inhabitants refers to snakes that may live in houses.\nThe devil came in human form to Abu Hurayrah, claiming to be poor and in need; the Hadith will be quoted below.\nIt was also narrated that he appeared in the form of Suraqah ibn Malik.\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe jinn may appear in human or animal form; they may appear in the form of snakes, scorpions and so on; or in the form of camels, cattle, sheep, horses, mules and donkeys; or in the form of birds. They may also appear in human form, as the Shaytan came to Quraysh in the form of Suraqah ibn Malik ibn Ja`sham, when they wanted to go out to Badr. Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And (remember) when Shaitan (Satan) made their (evil) deeds seem fair to them and said, ‘No one of mankind can overcome you this Day (of the battle of Badr) and verily, I am your neighbour (for each and every help).’ But when the two forces came in sight of each other, he ran away and said ‘Verily, I have nothing to do with you. Verily! I see what you see not. Verily! I fear Allah for Allah is Severe in punishment.’} [Al-Anfal 8:48] (End quote from Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 19/44-45)\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) also said:\n“The black dog is the devil among dogs, and the jinn often appear in that form, and also in the form of black cats, because the black colour is more able to concentrate devilish power than other colours, and it concentrates heat.” (End quote from Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 19/52)\nDr. `Umar Al-Ashqar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Sometimes the devils come to man not by way of Waswasah (whispering insinuating thoughts); rather they appear to him in human form, or a person may hear a voice and not see a body. Or they may appear in strange forms, which come to people and tell them that they are from the jinn. Sometimes they lie and say that they are angels, and sometimes they call themselves “men of the unseen”, or claim that they are from the spirit world. In all cases, they speak to some people directly, or by means of one person who is called a “medium”, whom they possess and they speak on his lips. Or the response may come in the form of writing, or it may go further than that and they may pick a person up and fly with him through the air, and transport him from one place to another. Or they may bring him things that he asks for. But they only do that to those who are misguided and who disbelieve in Allah, the Lord of heaven and earth, or who do evil deeds and things that incur divine wrath. Those people may pretend to be righteous and pious, but in fact they are among the most misguided and evil of people. The earlier and later generations have told many stories about this matter, to such an extent that it is not possible to reject or deny them, because they have been narrated by so many from so many.” (End quote from `Alam Al-Jinn wa Ash-Shayatin, p. 115)\nCan the Jinn appear in Ramadan?\nThere is no difference between the month of Ramadan and other months with regard to seeing the jinn in different forms; rather it is proven in an authentic Hadith that the jinn may appear in human form during the month of Ramadan.\nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said:\nThe Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) put me in charge of guarding the Zakah (charity) of Ramadan. Someone came to me and started scooping up handfuls of the food. I grabbed him and said, ‘I will take you to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).’. He said: ‘Verily I am in need, and I have dependents and am in great need.’ So I let him go.\nThe next day, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) asked me: ‘O Abu Hurayrah, what did your prisoner do last night?’ I said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, he complained of great need and having dependents, so I took pity on him and let him go.’ He said: ‘He lied to you and he will come back.’\nThen I knew that he would come back, because the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said that he would come back. So I lay in wait for him, and he came and started scooping up handfuls of the food. I grabbed him and said, ‘I will take you to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).’ He said: ‘Let go of me, for I am in need, and I have dependents; I will not come back.’\nI took pity on him and let him go, then the next morning the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) asked me: ‘O Abu Hurayrah, what did your prisoner do last night?’ I said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, he complained of great need and dependents, so I took pity on him and let him go.’ He said: ‘He lied to you and he will come back.’\nSo I lay in wait for him on the third night, and he came and started scooping up handfuls of the food. I took hold of him and said, ‘I will take you to the Messenger of Allah, and this is the last of three times. You say that you will not come back, but then you come back.’\nHe said: ‘Let go of me, and I will teach you some words by means of which Allah will benefit you.’ I said, ‘What are they?’ He said, ‘When you go to your bed, recite Ayat Al-Kursi (interpretaion of the meaning), {Allah! La ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), Al-Hayyul-Qayyum (the Ever Living, the One Who sustains and protects all that exists)…} [Al-Baqarah 2:255] – until you complete the verse, for then you will have a protector from Allah and no devil will come near you until morning.’\nSo I let him go, and the next morning the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked me, ‘What did your prisoner do last night?’ I said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, he claimed that he would teach me some words by means of which Allah would benefit me, so I let him go.’ He said: ‘What were they?’ I said: ‘He said to me: “When you go to your bed, recite Ayat Al-Kursi from beginning to end, ‘Allah! La ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), Al-Hayy al-Qayyum (the Ever Living, the One Who sustains and protects all that exists)…’” And he said to me: “You will have a protector from Allah and no devil will come near you until morning.” – And they (the Companions) were very eager to learn good things –\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ‘Indeed he told you the truth, although he is an inveterate liar.
