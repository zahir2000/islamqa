451799,"I used mint-flavored dental floss after the pre-dawn meal, and the mint flavor remained in my mouth. I swallowed my saliva after dawn, and the mint flavor was present, so does this invalidate my fasting?","['Praise be to Allah.The basic principle concerning flavoured dental floss is that saliva dissolves it and removes it from the mouth due to its small amount and the continuous flow of saliva in the mouth, and it does not have a substance that remains in the mouth. Therefore, if a Muslim uses it before dawn, the remaining flavor does not harm him, similar to the case of strong-tasting foods, like coffee and the like, where the taste remains after brushing and rinsing. This does not affect fasting due to the difficulty of avoiding it, and what is difficult to avoid does not break the fast even if it has substance.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n""Whoever wakes up with food between his teeth is not free from two situations; one of them is that it is so little that he cannot spit it out, so he swallows it, and it does not break his fast; because it is not possible to avoid it, so it is like saliva. Ibn Al-Mundhir said: The Jurists have reached a consensus on this..."" End quote from ""Al-Mughni"" by Ibn Qudamah (4/360).\nThe Hadiths, in their generality, indicate that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) used to use the miswak while fasting, and this indicates that the remaining taste of the miswak in the mouth of the fasting person is not a problem and does not affect his fast.\nFor further benefit, please see the answer to question number: (108014 ), and number: (405051 ).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/451799/ruling-on-finding-the-taste-of-dental-floss-in-mouth-after-fajr
9843,We see some people among us in the mosque moving in the prayer in anticipation of the Imam’s movements and not after the Imam. Sometimes they move before the Imam. What is the ruling on this?,"['Praise be to Allah.It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The Imam is appointed to be followed . When he says ‘Allahu akbar’, then say ‘Allahu akbar’, do not say it until he has said it. When he bows in Ruku`, then bow in Ruku`, and do not do it until he has done it. When he says ‘Sami`a Allahu liman hamidah,’ then say, ‘Allahumma Rabbana laka al-hamd.’ When he prostrates, then prostrate, and do not do it until he has done it. If he prays standing then pray standing, and if he prays sitting, then pray sitting, all of you.” (This version was narrated by Abu Dawud; similar reports are also narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim).\n\xa0What we learn from this Hadith is that it is obligatory to follow the Imam , and that he is the leader in the movements, actions and words of the prayer. It is not permissible to differ from him. The best is for the follower’s movements to come immediately after the Imam’s movements , and not to delay them … This immediate following is indicated (in the original Arabic of the Hadith) by the particle Fa (immediately after), which implies fats sequence.\n\xa0We also learn from this Hadith that anticipating or preceding the Imam is forbidden , and if it is done deliberately, it invalidates the prayer. Delaying following him, like preceding him, is not allowed.\n\xa0The phrase “the Imam is appointed to be followed” means that the one who is following should not precede the one whom he is following or move at the same time as him; his movements should come straight after the Imam’s movements.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9843/is-it-permissible-to-precede-the-imam-in-the-prayer
432215,"When fasting, do I have to take my invisalign out while making wudu? It can retain some water. If I have to take it off when making wudu, do I have to dry it from saliva before putting it back in my mouth, since when saliva exits the mouth it breaks the fast if swallowed again.","['Praise be to Allah.After speaking with some orthodontic specialists, and direct observation of a person with clear aligners, and observing the removal and replacement of the aligners; it became apparent to us that the clear aligners retain a quantity of water during rinsing. It is also possible that water leaks \xa0into the mouth without the person realizing it.\nThis remaining quantity exceeds the excused amount, which is what remains in the mouth after rinsing, estimated at between 1 to 1.5 ml at most through clinical medical trials.\n(See: ""Al-Mufattirat At-Tibbiyyah\xa0Al-Mu`sirah,"" Dr. Abdul Razzaq Al-Kindi, p. 172).\nTherefore, since the user of the clear aligners can remove and install them alone without harm or difficulty: it is obligatory for them to remove them while fasting.\xa0\xa0They can wear them from sunset to the Fajr prayer or they can remove them after each time they rinse their mouth and empty the remaining water in them.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/432215/effect-of-invisible-aligner-on-the-fast
174432,My husband and I have frozen embryos left over from a treatment which resulted in my little boy who is nearly 2. I found out that it is not permissible to keep the frozen embryos. I was wondering whether we will be able to use the leftover embryos to do a treatment which we are looking to do as soon as possible or will we have to destroy the embryos? Please advise me.,"['Praise be to Allah.Are test-tube babies allowed in Islam?\nArtificial insemination , or what is known as test-tube babies , takes many forms, some of which are permissible and some are prohibited.\xa0\nThe permissible forms include cases in which the sperm is taken from the man and the egg is taken from his wife, and fertilization takes place externally , then the embryo is implanted in the wife’s uterus.\nIn this case, it is essential to take precautions and look for trustworthy doctors, for fear of tampering, because some doctors may use sperm that does not come from the husband when they already know that the husband’s sperm is not suitable for fertilization; and there are other problems and evil consequences that may occur.\xa0\nCan women use frozen embryos?\nIt is not permissible to keep eggs or embryos , and the fertilization of eggs must be limited to the required number so as to avoid having an excess of fertilized eggs. If there is an excess of fertilized eggs, they should be left without any care to die naturally. \xa0\nThat is because keeping embryos or eggs may lead to them being mixed with others as time goes by, either by mistake or deliberately, as has happened in many cases. Some of them may be taken and placed in the uterus of another woman , which leads to confusion of lineages, which is a serious evil that outweighs the interests which the couple may think are served by keeping embryos to save money and use for fertilization later on.\xa0\nThe Islamic Fiqh Council belonging to the Organization of the Islamic Conference has issued a statement on this matter. The text follows:\xa0\n“1-\xa0\xa0\xa0 In the light of what has happened of the possibility of keeping unfertilized eggs to be used later on, when fertilizing eggs it must be limited to the required number for implantation each time, to avoid an excess of fertilized eggs.\n2-\xa0\xa0\xa0 If there are any extra fertilized eggs – for any reason – they should be left without medical care until they die naturally.\n3-\xa0\xa0\xa0 It is prohibited to use fertilized eggs in another woman, and sufficient precautions must be taken to prevent using fertilized eggs for an illegitimate pregnancy.” (Majallat Majma` Al-Fiqh Al-Islami, issue no. 7, vol. 3, p. 563)\xa0\nBased on that, what you have to do is dispose of the frozen embryos; it is permissible for you to undergo further artificial insemination even if that is costly or difficult, because that harm cannot be compared to the possibility of embryos being mixed up, especially since this length of time has passed.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/174432/can-women-use-frozen-embryos
