It has become common for shops to buy these cards from the Saudi Telecommunication Company, for example, for a price of fifty riyals, then they sell them for fifty-three riyals, even though the purchaser will only have fifty riyals’ worth of connection. What is the ruling on the storekeeper charging the three extra riyals, or more or less than that? Similarly, there are cards for calling from phone boxes for international calls, for which the company reduces the price by one or two riyals for a customer who takes a number of these cards, so that the one who buys them in quantity will benefit from that, and will receive them for less than their original value. Do you think there is anything wrong with that?\nAnswer: There is nothing wrong with buying and selling this type of phone cards, because in fact it is selling a permissible, useful service.\nAnd Allah is the source of strength.

323262,"Is it proven that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) gave any gift to any of his wives, or is it proven that any of the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) gave any gift to his wife? I hope that the answer will be supported with evidence from the religious texts.","['Praise be to Allah.Gifts in the Life of the Prophet\nWe have not come across many examples of a man giving a gift to his wife at the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Perhaps the reason for that is that gifts would be mixed with maintenance [as it is the man’s responsibility to spend on his wife], or because of the situation of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them), because they lived an austere life and did not accumulate a great deal of worldly wealth as the people who came after them, and as is the case nowadays.\nThe Virtue of Gifting\nBut establishing the virtue of a man giving a gift to his wife does not depend on there being examples of that in the life of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Rather in that regard it is sufficient to note the command to treat one’s wife kindly.\nIslam encourages the giving of gifts , as in the Hadith of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Exchange gifts; you will love one another.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari in Al-Adab Al-Mufrad, 594; classed as authentic by Shaykh Al-Albani in Irwa’ Al-Ghalil, 6/44)\nAnd the wife is one of the people who are most deserving of gifts from her husband.\nKind Treatment of One’s Wife:\nIt was narrated that `A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The best of you are the best of you to his wife, and I am the best of you to my wives.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 3895; he said: This is an authentic Hadith).\nIt was narrated from Hakim ibn Mu`awiyah Al-Qushayri (may Allah have mercy on him) that his father said: I said: O Messenger of Allah, what are the rights of the wife of one of us over him? He said: “That you should feed her when you eat, clothe her when you clothe yourself…” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 2142; classed as authentic by Shaykh Al-Albani in Irwa’ Al-Ghalil, 7/98)\nAllah, may He be Exalted, Says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And live with them in kindness. For if you dislike them – perhaps you dislike a thing and Allah makes therein much good.} [An-Nisa’ 4:19]\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“And live with them in kindness” means: speak kindly to them, and act kindly towards them, and make your appearance good as much as you can. Just as you would like that from her, do that for her too, as Allah, may He be Exalted, Says (interpretation of the meaning): {And due to them [i.e., the wives] is similar to what is expected of them, according to what is reasonable.} [Al-Baqarah 2:228]\xa0\nAnd the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The best of you are the best of you to his wife, and I am the best of you to my wives.” It was the Prophet’s character to always treat his wives kindly, with a cheerful, gentle and playful attitude; he would spend generously on them and joke with his wives.

111811,Is it obligatory for a man to spend on his grandchildren?,"['Praise be to Allah.It is obligatory for a man to spend on his children and grandchildren.\nWith regard to his children, that is because Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {And if they breastfeed for you, then give them their payment} [At-Talaq 65:6]. This verse indicates that the father is obliged to pay for breastfeeding the child.\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to Hind, the wife of Abu Sufyan, when she complained to him that Abu Sufyan was a stingy man: “Take – that is, from his wealth – that which will suffice you and your child on a reasonable basis.”\nTherefore it is obligatory for the child’s maintenance to be spent on from the wealth of the father.\nIbn Al-Mundhir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: All of the scholars from whom we acquired knowledge are unanimously agreed that a man is obliged to spend on the maintenance of his minor children who have no wealth. (End quote)\nIf the father is alive and is wealthy, then it is obligatory for him alone to spend on the children, and it is not obligatory for the mother.\nBut if the father is poor or is deceased, then the mother is obliged to spend on her children, if she is rich and they are poor.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Mughni (11/373):\nIf the father is not well off – meaning that he is poor – then spending [on the children’s maintenance] becomes obligatory for the mother. (End quote)\nWith regard to grandchildren, it is obligatory to spend on them, according to the majority of scholars, because a grandson may be called a “son” or “child.”\nAllah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Allah instructs you concerning your children: for the male, what is equal to the share of two females} [An-Nisa’ 4:11].\nThe word {children (Awlad)} in this verse includes the children of one’s son, according to scholarly consensus, and they are one’s grandchildren.\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said regarding Al-Hasan ibn `Ali (may Allah be pleased with them both): “This son of mine will be a leader.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 2704).\nAl-Hasan (may Allah be pleased with him) is the son of the daughter of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), his grandson through his daughter.\nThe fact that a grandson is called a son means that the grandson is included in the religious texts which indicate that it is obligatory to spend on one’s children.\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti` (13/498-499), in the chapter on spending on relatives:\nYour ascendants are those from whom you stem, fathers and mothers.\nYour descendants are those who stem from you, sons and daughters.\nThen he said:\nYou should understand that this issue is similar to the issue of what is prohibited for marriage; there is no difference between the father’s side or the mother’s side. Ascendants and descendants are the same, whether they are on the father’s side or the mother’s side or are entitled to an allocated share (of inheritance); it is obligatory to spend on them, but that is subject to some conditions. (End quote)\nIn order for it to be obligatory to spend on grandchildren, it is stipulated that they should be poor and have no wealth that could suffice them, and the grandfather should be rich, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Start with yourself and give charity to yourself. If there is anything left over, then (give) to your family. If there is anything left over from your family, then (give) to your relatives.” (Narrated by Muslim, 997)']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/111811/the-obligation-to-spend-on-children-and-grandchildren
5882,"I need your advise on the following, please. What happens if two people who are planning to get married both read their Istikharah Namaz and only the woman gets the message and not the man. This sister saw herself and her future husband as being happy and together and she feels that ALLAH is telling her that they are right for each other. But what if the man doesn't get any sign/feeling/dream whatsoever. What do they do then? And for how many days does one have to read this Namaz. Some people say for 3 days others say for 7.","['Praise be to Allah.Authentic evidence for the Istikharah prayer\nThe evidence for the Al-Istikharah prayer and the Du`a to be recited is the report narrated by Al-Bukhari (1109) and others from Jabir ibn `Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with them both).\xa0\nTrue signs of guidance after performing Istikharah\nWith regard to what some people say, then he should go ahead with whatever he feels happy with, a Hadith to this effect was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) narrated by Ibn As-Sunni according to which he said, If you are concerned about a matter, then offer Istikharah seven times, praying to your Lord, then see what you feel most drawn towards, and the good will be in that.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Its chain of narration is odd, and it includes narrators whom I do not know. (End quote from Al-Adhkar, p. 132)\nAl-Hafidh ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If this were proven, it could be taken as evidence, but its chain of narration is very inauthentic. (End quote from Al-Fat-h, 11/223)\nAl-Hafidh Al-`Iraqi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It contains a narrator who is known to be very inauthentic, namely Ibrahim ibn Al-Bara’.. Therefore, the Hadith is very inauthentic. (End quote from Al-Futuhat Ar-Rabbaniyyah, 3/357)\nUnderstanding the significance of ease and obstacles\nThe correct view is that when Allah makes something easy for you after having decreed it and accepted your Du`a this is a sign that it is good to go ahead and do it. The existence of obstacles and difficulties is an indication that Allah is pushing His slave away from doing it. This meaning will be very clear when one ponders the meaning of the Hadith of Jabir concerning Al-Istikharah , where the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:\nO Allah, if You know this affair [and here he should mention it] is good for me in relation to my religion, my life, and end, then decree and facilitate it for me, and bless me with it, and if You know this affair to be ill for me towards my religion, my life, and end, then remove it from me and remove me from it, and decree for me what is good wherever it be and make me satisfied with such.\nIbn `Allan (may Allah have mercy on him) after transmitting the scholarly view that the Hadith of Anas is inauthentic said: Therefore it was said: that after (doing Istikharah ) he should do what he wants (i.e., even if he does not feel that sense of being happy), because whatever happens after doing Istikharah is good\nAl-Hafidh ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Al-Hafidh Zayn Ad-Din Al-`Iraqi said (concerning doing something after praying Istikharah): Whatever he does, there will be good in it. This is supported by what is said at the end of the Hadith of Ibn Mas`ud according to some of its chains of narration: Then let him make his decision. I (Ibn Hajar) say: I have already discussed above and explained that its narrators (i.e., the narrators who added the phrase Then let him make his decision) are inauthentic. But this is still stronger than the narrator of that Hadith (i.e., the Hadith which says, then see what you feel most drawn towards). (End quote from Al-Futuhat Ar-Rabbaniyyah, 3/355-357)\nThe relation between Istikharah and dreams\nAnother of the myths that are widespread among people is that after praying Istikharah you should sleep, and whatever good you see in your dream that makes you happy means that what you want to do is good and will be made easy for you, otherwise it is not good. (This is what the questioner meant by saying gets the message). There is no authentic evidence for this as far as we know.\nThe above does not mean that if you feel happy it is not a sign, but this should not be regarded as the only sign about whether or not the matter is good. People often make Istikharah about something they like or want to do, so they feel happy about it from the outset.\nShaykh Al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyah] (may Allah have mercy on him) said concerning the matter of feeling happy about something: If he makes Istikharah, then whatever Allah makes him feel happy about and makes it easy for him, this is what Allah has chosen for him. (End quote from Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 10/539)\nRepeating Istikharah: Is there a limit?\nThere is a difference between making feeling happy the only sign and making it one of several signs. There is no set time period for Salat Al-Istikharah; it is permissible to repeat it more than once, but there is no limit to how many times. The person may offer the Du`a before or after saying the Salam (when concluding the prayer).\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/5882/istikharah-signs
