480298,,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nTakbir for the prostration of recitation in the prayer is a matter concerning which scholarly views differ, and there is no proven hadith text which speaks specifically about it. The majority of scholars are of the view that the worshipper should say takbir for the prostration of recitation when going down into prostration and when rising from it.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf someone does the prostration of recitation, he should say takbir for prostrating and for rising from it, whether in prayer or otherwise. This is the view of Ibn Sirin, al-Hasan, Abu Qilabah, an-Nakha‘i, Muslim ibn Yasar, Abu ‘Abd ar-Rahman as-Sulami, ash-Shafa‘i, Ishaq, and ashab ar-ra’y.\nMalik said: That is if he is praying; it is different if he is not praying.\nWhat supports our view is the report narrated by Ibn ‘Umar, who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to recite Qur’an for us, and if he came to a sajdah, he would say takbir and prostrate, and we would prostrate with him…\nMoreover, because it is an isolated prostration, it is prescribed to say takbir at the beginning of it and when rising from it, as is the case with the prostration of forgetfulness (sujud al-sahw) after the salaam.\nIt is proven that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said takbir in that case when prostrating and when rising from prostration.\nAl-Khiraqi did not mention saying takbir for rising from prostration, but it was mentioned by others among our companions, and it is an analogy, as we mentioned above.""(Al-Mughni\xa0 2/359).\nThe hadith of Ibn ‘Umar mentioned above was narrated by Abu Dawud, no. 1413, via ‘Abd ar-Razzaq, who said: ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar [al-‘Umari] told us, from Nafi‘, from Ibn ‘Umar, who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to recite Qur’an to us, and if he came to a sajdah, he would say takbir and prostrate, and we would prostrate with him.\nThis hadith was deemed to be da‘if (weak) by a number of scholars, because its isnad includes ‘Abdullah al-‘Umari, who is regarded as da‘if. His brother ‘Ubaydullah – who is trustworthy and reliable, and one of the most reliable and trustworthy narrators from Nafi‘ – disagreed with him. He narrated this hadith without any mention of takbir, as was narrated by al-Bukhari (1075) and Muslim (575), from ‘Ubaydillah ibn ‘Umar, who said: Nafi‘ told me, that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to recite Qur’an for us, and if he came to a sajdah, he would prostrate, and we would prostrate with him, until one of us could not find a space for his forehead.\nShaykh al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) said, regarding the isnad of the hadith narrated by Abu Dawud:\nThis is a layyin (“soft”) isnad – as al-Hafiz said in Bulugh al-Maram – and the problem with it is that ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar [al-‘Umari] is da‘if. Al-Bayhaqi did not comment on it, and Ibn al-Turkmani commented on that lack of comment in al-Jawhar an-Naqi where he said: Its isnad includes ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar, the brother of ‘Ubaydillah, about whom there is some criticism. Ibn al-Madini classed him as da‘if and Yahya ibn Sa‘id did not narrate from him. Ibn Hanbal said: He used to add to isnads. Salih ibn Muhammad said: He is layyin and is confused in his narration of hadith.\nI say: His brother ‘Ubaydullah, who was trustworthy, differed from him. He narrated something similar from Nafi‘ but did not mention takbir, as noted above in the hadith before it. This indicates that the mention of takbir in this report is something odd (munkar), according to the principles of ‘ilm al-hadith. And Allah knows best.""(Irwa’ al-Ghalil\xa02/224).\nRather the proof for it being prescribed to say takbir when doing the prostration of recitation in the prayer is to be found in the Prophet’s Sunnah, as the general meaning of some hadiths indicates that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to say takbir with every movement up or down in the prayer.\nFor example, it is narrated by al-Bukhari (785) and Muslim (392) from Abu Salamah ibn ‘Abd ar-Rahman, from Abu Hurayrah, that he used to lead them in prayer. He said takbir every time he moved up or down, and when he finished he said: I am the one among you whose prayer most closely resembles that of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nAnd it was narrated by at-Tirmidhi (253) and others that ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to say takbir every time he moved up or down, to stand or sit, and so did Abu Bakr and ‘Umar.\nAt-Tirmidhi said: Regarding this issue, there are reports from Abu Hurayrah, Anas, Ibn ‘Umar, Abu Malik al-Ash‘ari, Abu Musa, ‘Imran ibn Husayn, Wa’il ibn Hujr and Ibn ‘Abbas. The hadith of ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud is a hasan sahih hadith, and the action of the Companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was based on that, including the action of Abu Bakr, ‘Umar, ‘Uthman, ‘Ali and others, and the action of the Tabi‘in who came after them. This is the practice of the majority of jurists and scholars. End quote.\nSecondly:\nShaykh al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) was of the view that the fact that there is no proven text that refers to saying takbir in this case indicates that it is not prescribed, and he regarded as\xa0 da‘if the report about takbir in the hadith of Ibn ‘Umar. Based on that, [in his view] there should be no takbir for the prostration of recitation, either when going down into prostration or when rising from it.\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) said, commenting on that in Fiqh as-Sunnah:\nWith regard to the prostration of recitation:\nThe words: “It was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to recite Qur’an for us, and if he came to a sajdah, he would say takbir and prostrate, and we would prostrate.” Narrated by Abu Dawud and al-Bayhaqi, and by al-Hakam, who said: It is sahih according to the conditions of al-Bukhari and Muslim.\nI [al-Albani] say: There are two points to be noted regarding it:\nThe first point is that this hadith is da‘if, because its isnad in Abu Dawud –\xa0 from whom al-Bayhaqi narrated it – includes ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar al-‘Umari, who is da‘if, as al-Hafiz said in at-Talkhis. Hence he said in Bulugh al-Maram: Its isnad has some softness in it. An-Nawawi said in al-Majmu‘:\nIts isnad is da‘if.\nIt was narrated from a number of the Sahabah that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) prostrated for recitation in many verses, on different occasions, and none of them mentioned that he said takbir for this prostration. Hence we are inclined to say that it is not prescribed to say this takbir. This is one of the views narrated from Imam Abu Hanifah (may Allah have mercy on him).""(Tamam al-Minnah fi’t-Ta‘liq ‘ala Fiqh as-Sunnah\xa0 p. 267).\nThus Shaykh al-Albani did not think that this takbir is Sunnah, either when going down into prostration or rising from it, because there is no text which specifically mentions it.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/480298/takbir-for-the-prostration-of-recitation-in-the-prayer
20009,It is the practice of my fellow Muslim women friends to wash their feminine pads used during menses before they would throw them away. Is it true that it is obligatory to do so even though we are using disposable feminine pads which we are not going to use again? A lot of cases of hysteria and other disturbances are being said to be caused by not washing the pads properly before throwing them away by those afflicted. They say that the devil of the jinn likes to eat menses blood left on unwashed pads and would then harm the one who didn’t wash it.,"['Praise be to Allah.None of the trustworthy scholars have stated that a woman has to wash her feminine rags or pads which may have traces of menstrual blood, if she is going to throw them away and not use them again. Rather it seems that the female Companions did not wash these pads; the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) knew about that and it is not narrated that he told them off for that.\xa0\nAt-Tirmidhi (61) and other authors of Sunan narrated that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “It was said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, should I do Wudu’ from the well of Buda`ah?’ – which was a well into which were thrown menstrual rags, the flesh of dogs and other putrid things. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Water is pure and nothing makes it impure.” This is an authentic Hadith which was classed as such by Ahmad, Yahya ibn Ma`in, Ibn Khuzaymah, Ibn Taymiyah and others (may Allah have mercy on them).\xa0\nWhat is referred to here by “menstrual rags” is the rags which were used for menstrual blood, as Al-Mubarakfuri (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his commentary on this Hadith. So it seems that they used to throw them away when they were contaminated with blood, otherwise the Companions would not have raised the issue of whether the water into which these rags were thrown was pure or not.\xa0\nThere is no sound basis for what your friends have said; rather it is a myth which has no basis. Such notions are widespread among the common folk, so you have to ask for proof and evidence, and refer to the scholars and books of knowledge. You have to reject these myths and warn people against them. Each person must protect himself against the evils of the devils among mankind and the jinn by remembering Allah a great deal (Dhikr), reciting Quran and adhering steadfastly to the commands of Shari`ah, and keeping away from myths and stories that have no proof.\nFor more details, please refer to the following\xa0 answers:\xa07776 ,\xa013948 , 1326 , and 44980 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20009/is-it-mandatory-in-islam-to-wash-used-sanitary-pads-before-throwing-them
301735,In which area of Makkah did the birds (Ababil) throw stone on the army of Abraha?,"['Praise be to Allah.Abrahah made preparations to enter Makkah; he mobilised his army and prepared his elephant. Then when he was in Wadi Muhassir, between Muzdalifah and Mina, the elephant knelt down and would not get up to advance towards the Ka‘bah.\nIt was said that when they made the elephant face towards Makkah, Nufayl ibn Habib al-Khath‘ami came up to the elephant and stood beside it, then he took hold of its ear and said: Sit down, Mahmoud, for you are in the sacred land of Allah. Then he let go of its ear, and the elephant knelt down. Nufayl left, running up to the top of the mountain. They beat the elephant to make it stand up, but it refused. So they struck its head to make it stand up, and it refused. They turned it around as if to go back to Yemen, and it got up and ran in that direction. They turned it to face towards Syria, and it did the same thing; they turned it to face towards the east, and it did the same thing; but when they turned it to face towards Makkah, it knelt down.\nWhilst they were like that, Allah, may He be exalted, sent against them birds in flocks from the sea. Each bird was carrying three stones, one in its beak and one in each of its feet; the size of the stones was like the size of chickpeas or lentils. None of the army were struck but his limbs were cut off and he died, but not all of them were struck; those who were spared fled, rushing towards the road by which they had come.\nSee: al-Lu’lu’ al-Maknun by al-‘Azimi (1/61).\nAs-Salihi said: When the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came to the bottom of Wadi Muhassir, he made his she-camel speed up and run quickly. This was his habit in places where the punishment of Allah had come down upon His enemies, and that was the place where there happened to the people of the elephant that which Allah has told us about.\nHence that wadi was called Wadi Muhassir, because the elephant halted (hasara) there and did not proceed any further.\nMuhassir is an area between Mina and Muzdalifah; it does not belong to either of them.""(Subul al-Huda wa’r-Rashad\xa0 8/474).\nAl-Fayyumi said: Wadi Muhassir is between Mina and Muzdalifah.\nIt is named thus because the elephant of Abrahah grew tired there and could not proceed any further, which caused sorrow (hasarat) to its owners.""(Al-Misbah al-Munir\xa0 1/135).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/301735/in-what-area-of-makkah-did-the-birds-ababil-throw-stones-on-the-army-of-abrahah
128850,"Is it permissible for me, as a Muslim, to read the Gospel out of curiosity, and not for any other purpose? Does believing in the divinely-revealed books mean believing that they are from Allah, or believing in what it says in them?","['Praise be to Allah.Belief in Divinely-revealed Books\nShaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said.\n“Every Muslim is required to believe in the Torah, Gospel and Zabur , and that they came from Allah. So he must believe that Allah sent down the Books to the Prophets , and that He sent to them scriptures that contained commands and prohibitions, exhortation and reminders, and spoke of matters of the past, of Paradise and Hell, and so on. But he should not follow them, because they have been affected by distortion, alterations and changes.\xa0\nSo he should not keep copies of the Torah, Gospel or Zabur, or read them , because this is dangerous, for he may end up disbelieving in something that is true or believing something that is false, because these books have been distorted and changed.\xa0\nThe Jews, Christians and others have altered them , distorted them and changed the order of material in these books. We have no need of them because of what Allah has given us of our own book, the Glorious Quran.\nIt was narrated from the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that he saw part of the Torah in the hand of `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him); he became angry and said: “Are you in doubt, O son of Al-Khattab? I have brought to you a message that is bright and pure, and if Musa were alive he would have no choice but to follow me.”\nIs it prohibited to read the Bible?\nThe point is that we advise you and others not to take anything from either the Torah or the Zabur or the Gospel, and not to keep any of these books. Rather if you have any of these things, then you should bury it or burn it, for the changes and alterations that have been introduced to them are evil and false . What is required of the believer is to avoid that and to beware of looking at it, for perhaps he may end up believing something that is false or disbelieving something that is true. The way to be safe from that is either to bury it or burn it.\nIt is permissible for a scholar who has insight to read it in order to refute\xa0Jewish and Christian opponents of Islam, as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) called for the Torah when the Jews denied the punishment of stoning, so that he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) could have it checked, after which they admitted [that the punishment of stoning is mentioned in the Torah].\nThe point is that the scholars who are well versed in Islamic teachings may need to look at the Torah or Gospel or Zabur for Islamic purposes, such as refuting the enemies of Allah, or to highlight the virtue of the Quran and what it contains of truth and guidance.\xa0\nAs for ordinary Muslims, they have no right to do that; rather if they have anything of the Torah or Gospel or Zabur, they must bury it in a clean place or burn it so that no one will be misguided by it.” (Fatawa Nur `ala Ad-Darb, 1/9-10)\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/128850/is-it-prohibited-to-read-the-bible
