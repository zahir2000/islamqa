409746,What will happen to the Dajjal? Will he go to hell?,"['Praise be to Allah.The false messiah the Dajjal is a human who will appear at the end of time. He is one of the major signs of the Hour. In the beginning, he will say that he is a prophet, then he will say that he is divine – exalted be Allah far above that.\nHe will call the people to believe in him, then it will become clear that he is not only a disbeliever; rather he is one of the worst of the disbelievers among the people of this earth, and there will be no doubt about that. Hence the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) told us that between his eyes will be written the word “kafir (disbeliever).” The false messiah the Dajjal will persist in his disbelief until the true Messiah, ‘Isa ibn Maryam (peace be upon him), kills him.\nThere follow some of the hadiths which were narrated about him:\nIbn Maajah (4215) narrated that Abu Umamah al-Bahili said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) addressed us, and most of his speech was talking about the Dajjaal and warning us against him. Among other things, he said: “There has never been any tribulation on earth since Allah created the progeny of Adam that will be greater than the tribulation of the Dajjal. Allah never sent any Prophet but he warned his nation about the Dajjal. I am the last of the prophets and you are the last of the nations, and he will inevitably emerge among you.\nIf he appears whilst I am among you, I will contend with him on your behalf, and if he appears when I am not among you, then each man must fend for himself and Allah will take care of every Muslim on my behalf. He will emerge from Khallah, between Syria and ‘Iraq, and will wreak havoc right and left. O slaves of Allah, remain steadfast.\nI will describe him to you in a manner in which none of the Prophets has described him before me. He will start by saying ‘I am a Prophet,’ but there is no Prophet after me. Then he will say, ‘I am your Lord.’ But you will not see your Lord until you die. He is one-eyed, but your Lord is not one-eyed, and written between his eyes is ‘kafir (disbeliever)’. Every believer will read it, whether he is literate or illiterate.\nPart of his fitnah will be that he will have with him a paradise and a hell, but his hell will be a paradise and his paradise a hell. Whoever is tested with his fire (hell), let him seek the help of Allah and recite the first verses of al-Kahf, then it will be cool and safe for him, as the fire was for Ibrahim.\nPart of his fitnah will be that he will say to a Bedouin, ‘What do you think, if I resurrect your father and mother for you, will you bear witness that I am your Lord?’ He will say, ‘Yes.’ Then two devils will appear to him in the form of his father and mother and will say, ‘O my son, follow him, for he is your Lord.’\nAnd part of his fitnah will be that he will overpower a single soul and kill him, then he will cut him with a saw until he falls in two pieces. Then he will say: ‘Look at this slave of mine; I will resurrect him now, then he will claim that he has a Lord other than me.’ Then Allah will resurrect him and the evil one will say to him: ‘Who is your Lord?’ and he will say, ‘Allah is my Lord, and you are the enemy of Allah, you are the Dajjaal. By Allah, I have never been more certain about you than I am today.’…”\nClassed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Jaami‘ (13833). See also: Qissat al-Masih ad-Dajjal by Shaykh al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him).\nMuslim (7560) narrated from an-Nawwas ibn Sam‘an that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) mentioned the Dajjal and he mentioned the son of Maryam, then he said: “He will pursue him until he catches up with him at the date of Ludd, then he will kill him.”\nAn-Nawawi said:\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) mentioned the gate of Ludd. Ludd (Lod) is a town close to Bayt al-Maqdis (Jerusalem). End quote.\nAhmad (3868) narrated from ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Those who will be most severely punished on the Day of Resurrection are: a man who was killed by a Prophet or who killed a Prophet, a leader who led people in the way of misguidance, and a maker of images.”\nShaykh Ahmad Shakir said: Its isnad is sahih.\nAl-Bukhari (4076) narrated with a mawquf isnad that Ibn ‘Abbaas said: “Allah’s wrath is severe against one who is killed by a prophet.”\nOnce this is established, we know that the false messiah the Dajjal will die as a disbeliever, persisting in his disbelief. He will be killed by the true Messiah ‘Isa ibn Maryam (peace be upon him) and he will be in the fire of hell, one of the most severely punished of people therein.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/409746/what-will-be-the-fate-of-the-false-messiah-the-dajjal-in-the-hereafter
449362,"I was previously addicted to drugs, and I committed all kinds of sins, such as not praying, and so on. I am currently in the stage of recovery and repentance to Allah, may He be exalted, but it is difficult for me to do my religious duties and also focus on recovery from addiction at the same time. Please note that I take psychiatric medication, but I am trying hard to make myself pray, so long as I am not sleeping. But if I sleep and miss the prayer, I do not pray it, so that I do not burden myself with more than I can bear. But I am aware that this is a sin, but I am taking it step-by-step to do my religious obligations, so that I do not give up and drift away, and go back to my old ways. But – praise be to Allah – now, I pray so long as I hear the adhan, even though I do not always pray in the mosque. But I strive to make myself do the prayers, and at the same time I am aware of my shortcomings. The only reason I am striving to do that is because I tried to repent many times before, but I repent and do everything (of religious duties) once, then I find it difficult and I go back to my old ways. But this time, I started gradually, meaning that first of all I started to pray when I was not sleeping, and I am trying hard to do the prayers in the mosque. My intention is that if I do this action (prayer) perfectly and get used to it, then I will start to do the next action, and so on. My question is: is it permissible for me to take religious practice step-by-step, if it is difficult for me to do what Islam tells me to do all at once? Is it permissible to pray at home, noting that I am unwell, and I always pray Fajr in congregation, but it is difficult for me to pray Zuhr? Is it okay if I do not fast, because I have to take my medicine or it is too difficult for me to fast, and so on? What must I do as an addict during the recovery period, and as someone who used not to pray, then began taking it step-by-step to do religious duties, so that I do not burden myself with that which I cannot bear?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nWe praise Allah, may He be exalted, for guiding you and enabling you to repent, and we ask Him to help you and grant you a full recovery.\nSecondly:\nYou must do what you are able to of religious duties, and you will be excused – in sha Allah – with regard to what you are unable to do or what is definitely too difficult and is more than you can bear, according to your situation.\nYour praying in the mosque is something that is required according to Islamic teachings, and it is also part of your recovery, because mixing with people and good people will have a beneficial impact, in sha Allah.\nIf you sleep and miss Zuhr, or it is too difficult for you to go out to pray in the mosque, then you may pray at home or when you wake up, because of the report narrated by Muslim (684) from Anas ibn Maalik, who said: The Prophet of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever forgets a prayer or sleeps and misses it, his expiation is to offer that prayer when he remembers it.”\nThirdly:\nFasting is an important obligation which it is not permissible to omit except when one has an excuse. If you will be harmed by delaying taking your medicine until after iftar, this is an excuse which makes it permissible for you not to fast, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{O you who have believed, decreed upon you is fasting as it was decreed upon those before you that you may become righteous.\n\xa0[Fasting for] a limited number of days. So whoever among you is ill or on a journey [during them] - then an equal number of days [are to be made up]}\xa0[Al-Baqarah 2:183-184].\nIf you will not be harmed by delaying taking your medicine until after iftar, then you must fast.\nIf you will face hardship and find it too difficult to carry on fasting during the day, even though you are physically healthy – meaning that you are not feeling any symptoms of sickness, not even a headache, for example – then you must intend to fast from the night before, then if you start finding it too difficult to carry on and you become certain that it is beyond your capability to continue fasting, and you fear that you may be harmed by severe thirst, then you may drink, then you must refrain from eating and drinking for the rest of the day, and make up that day later on.\nIt says in Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah (10/233): It is not permissible for the accountable person not to fast during the day in Ramadan just because he is working.\nBut during the day, if he faces extreme hardship and realises that he has no choice but to break the fast during the day, he may do so by eating or drinking that which will ward off the hardship, then he should refrain from eating and drinking until sunset and break the fast with the people, and he must make up that day on which he broke the fast. End quote.\nBut if you are suffering from illness, such as a severe headache, this makes it permissible to not fast.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: There are several different scenarios with regard to the sick person and fasting.\n1.. He will not be affected by fasting, such as if he has a mild cold, a mild headache or a toothache and the like. In this case, it is not permissible for him not to fast, even though the scholars say that it is permissible for him not to fast because of the general meaning of the verse (interpretation of the meaning): {and whoever is ill} [al-Baqarah 2:185].\nBut we say: If this ruling is connected to a scenario in which breaking the fast will ease the hardship for him, then in that case we say that he may break the fast. But if the sick person will not be affected by fasting, then it is not permissible for him not to fast, and he is obliged to fast.\n2.. If it is difficult for him to fast (because of his sickness), but it will not harm him, then in this case it is disliked (makruh) for him to fast, and it is Sunnah for him to not fast.\n3.. If it is difficult for him to fast and it will harm him, such as a man who is suffering from kidney disease, diabetes or the like, then in that case fasting is prohibited for him.""(Ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘\xa0 6/341).\nWe advise you to offer a great deal of supplication and beseech Allah, may He be exalted, to accept your repentance and grant you good health. Strive to offer supplication at the times when a response is likely.\nWe ask Allah to comfort you, make things easy for you and accept your repentance.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/449362/he-is-being-treated-for-addiction-and-finds-it-difficult-to-do-the-prayers-and-fast
