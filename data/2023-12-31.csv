265015,"I did wudu, after which I put on socks so that I could wipe over them. When I woke up for Fajr prayer, I felt unwell and was unable to do wudu with water, so I did tayammum and prayed Fajr, and I completed my wudu by wiping over the socks. Is my completing it by wiping over the socks valid?","['Praise be to Allah.If someone puts on khuffs after doing a complete wudu, he may wipe over them within the timeframe that is allowed, which is one day and night for one who is not travelling, and three days for one who is travelling.\nHe does not have to take the khuffs off until that period ends, or he finds himself in a state of major impurity, in which case he must take them off when he wants to purify himself (ghusl). It was narrated from ‘Abd ar-Rahman ibn Abi Bakrah, from his father, that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) granted a concession to travellers: if a traveller did wudu and put on khuffs, then he invalidated his wudu, he could wipe over the khuffs for three days and nights; the non-traveller could do so for one day and one night.\nNarrated by Ibn Majah (556) and others. Ibn ‘Abd al-Hadi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Tanqih al-Tahqiq (1/334): This isnad of this hadith is qawiy. End quote. It was classed as hasan by al-Albani.\nPlease see also the answer to question no. 9640 .\nSo if he put them on when he was in a state of purity, then did tayammum after that, then the excuse that made tayammum permissible was no longer applicable, so he did wudu and wiped over his socks, there is nothing wrong with that, and there is no report from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to suggest that doing tayammum – during the period in which wiping over the socks is permissible – invalidates the concession that allows wiping over the khuffs.\nThe basic principle is that things remain as they are and cannot be changed except on the basis of evidence, and we do not know of any evidence to indicate that this is not allowed.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/265015/is-it-permissible-to-wipe-over-socks-that-were-put-on-when-in-a-state-of-purity-after-having-been-compelled-to-do-tayammum
59911,Is Islamic `Aqidah a theoretical method or a practical method? What books can we read to learn about `Aqidah? How can we apply `Aqidah in real life? What are the ways of learning `Aqidah? Is doing one Islamic thing and not another (such as praying but not giving Zakah or not lowering the gaze etc) regarded as a fault in one’s `Aqidah? Do the Muslims nowadays need someone to teach them `Aqidah?,"[""Praise be to Allah.Is Islamic `Aqidah Theoretical?\nIslamic `Aqidah is not a theoretical and philosophical method; action is an essential part of this `Aqidah. Hence the Ahl As-Sunnah agreed that faith consists of words and deeds, or speaking with the tongue, believing in the heart and acting with the physical faculties.\xa0\nWhoever believes in Allah as his Lord and God, will worship Him and obey Him by praying, giving Zakah and so on.\xa0\nWhoever believes in the Last Day and its reckoning and reward or punishment, will be motivated thereby to do that which Allah has commanded and abstain from that which He has forbidden.\xa0\nWhoever believes that Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the Messenger of Allah will therefore obey him, follow his Sunnah and propagate his religion. \xa0\nThus the principles in which a person believes are translated into actions and words and efforts. The stronger that faith grows in his heart, the more its effects will be seen outwardly.\xa0\nHence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “In the body there is a piece of flesh which, if it is sound, the entire body will be sound, and if it is corrupt, the entire body will be corrupt. It is the heart.” Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 52; Muslim, 1599)\nAl-Hasan Al-Basri (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Faith is not the matter of wishes or outward appearances, rather it is that which settles in the heart and is confirmed by one's actions.”\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“If the heart is sound in terms of faith, knowledge and feelings, then this will inevitably lead to the soundness of physical actions, such as verbal statements and deeds. As the leading scholars of Hadith said: Words and deeds, both inward and outward. What is outward must follow what is inward, so if what is inward is sound then what is outward will also be sound, and if it (the former) is corrupt, (the latter) will also be corrupt. Hence one of the Companions said concerning the one who prayed carelessly: If his heart had been humble and focused, his body would have been humble and focused.” (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 7/187)\nBooks on `Aqidah\nWith regard to books which one may read about `Aqidah , there are many, the greatest of which are the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), in which there is protection and salvation for those who adhere closely to them. The scholars were concerned with explaining and propagating sound `Aqidah , and they wrote innumerable books on this topic. Among the most famous of these books are the following:\xa0\n\nAs-Sunnah by `Abdullah ibn Ahmad ibn Hanbal\nAt-Tawhid by Ibn Khuzaymah\nSharh Usul I`tiqad Ahl As-Sunnah by Al-Lalka’i\n`Aqidat As-Salaf wa As-hab Al-Hadith by Al-Sabuni\nAl-`Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah by Ibn Taymiyah [available in English translation]\nAl-`Aqidah Al-Tahhawiyyah wa Sharhuha by Ibn Abu Al-`Izz Al-Hanafi\nLawami` Al-Anwar Al-Bahiyyah by Al-Safarini\nMa`arij Al-Qubul by Hafiz Hakami\nAl-Irshad ila Sahih Al-I`tiqad by Shaykh Salih Al-Fawzan – this is an easy and useful book.\xa0\n\nHow to apply `Aqidah in real life\nWith regard to applying this `Aqidah in real life, this is done by learning it, propagating it, calling others to it, and refuting those who go against it with wisdom and beautiful preaching. This is how `Aqidah is spread and its effects made manifest so that all people may benefit from it.\xa0\nHow to learn `Aqidah\nThe way in which `Aqidah may be learned is to learn it directly from those who believe in it and act accordingly. This is the soundest and best way for those who are able to do it. For those who are far away from scholars, they should refer to their commentaries, writings and tapes, as well as asking about confusing matters and anything they do not understand.\xa0\nIf a person follows some of the teachings of Islam and neglects others, by failing to do some of the obligatory duties or by committing some of the acts that are forbidden, this is a shortcoming in his faith and a weakness in his belief and his love for his Lord and His religion. This is undoubtedly a fault in his `Aqidah.\xa0\nHence one of the basic principles of Ahl As-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah is that faith increases by doing acts of worship and decreases by doing acts of sin. These shortcomings and faults may erase faith altogether, so that the person becomes an apostate from Islam, such as if he stops praying. Please see question no.\xa05208 \xa0and\xa02182 .\xa0\nWith regard to sins that do not reach the level of disbelief, such as withholding obligatory Zakah or looking at prohibited things and so on, these are things which cause faith to decrease.\xa0\nWhat is the correct `Aqidah?\nThe Muslims need people to explain pure, correct `Aqidah to them, that is based on the Quran and Sunnah according to the understanding of the righteous Salaf. That is because of the widespread existence of ignorance, innovations (Bid’ah), myths and deviant schools of thought.\xa0\nEvery Muslim must be sincere towards himself first of all, by learning correct `Aqidah from trustworthy sources, then by propagating it and teaching it to the people, by means of lessons and lectures, books, publications and magazines, thus fulfilling the duty to convey the message as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“(And remember) when Allah took a covenant from those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) to make it (the news of the coming of Prophet Muhammad and the religious knowledge) known and clear to mankind, and not to hide it.” [Al-`Imran 3:187]\xa0\n“Let there arise out of you a group of people inviting to all that is good (Islam), enjoining Al-Ma‘roof (i.e. Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam orders one to do) and forbidding Al-Munkar (polytheism and disbelief and all that Islam has forbidden). And it is they who are the successful.” [Al `Imran 3:104]\xa0\n“Say (O Muhammad): ‘This is my way; I invite unto Allah (i.e. to the Oneness of Allah — Islamic Monotheism) with sure knowledge, I and whosoever follows me (also must invite others to Allah, i.e. to the Oneness of Allah — Islamic Monotheism with sure knowledge). And Glorified and Exalted be Allah (above all that they associate as partners with Him). And I am not of the Mushrikun (polytheists, pagans, idolaters and disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah; those who worship others along with Allah or set up rivals or partners to Allah.)’”\xa0[Yusuf 12:108]\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/59911/is-islamic-aqidah-theoretical

31807,"What are the actions which, if a Muslim does them, he will be an apostate from Islam?.","[""Praise be to Allah.Shaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn `Abdullah ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Note that Allah has commanded all people to enter Islam and to adhere to it and to beware of whatever is contrary to it. He sent His Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to call mankind to that. He tells us that those who follow him will be guided and that those who turn away from him have gone astray.\nIn many verses He warns against the means that lead to apostasy and all forms of polytheism and disbelief .\nThe scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) have said, when discussing apostasy, that a Muslim may apostatize from his religion by doing many acts that nullify Islam, which makes it permissible to shed his blood and seize his wealth, and which will put him beyond the pale of Islam.\xa0\nAmong the most serious and most common of these things are ten which were mentioned by Shaykh Muhammad ibn `Abd Al-Wahhaab and other scholars (may Allah have mercy on them all).\xa0\nWe will mention them in brief here, so that you and others can beware of them, in the hope that you will be safe and sound. We will also explain a little about them after mentioning each one. \xa0\n\nShirk or associating others in worship with Allah . Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n\n“Verily, Allah forgives not (the sin of) setting up partners (in worship) with Him, but He forgives whom He wills, sins other than that, and whoever sets up partners in worship with Allah, has indeed strayed far away.”\xa0[An-Nisa’ 4:116]\xa0\n“Verily, whosoever sets up partners (in worship) with Allah, then Allah has forbidden Paradise to him, and the Fire will be his abode.”\xa0[Al-Ma’idah 5:72]\nThat includes praying to the dead, seeking their help, making vows and offering sacrifices to them or to the jinn or to the grave.\xa0\n\nWhoever sets up intermediaries between himself and Allah and calls upon them, asks them to intercede, and puts his trust in them, is a disbeliever according to scholarly consensus.\xa0\nWhoever does not regard the polytheists as disbelievers, or doubts that they are disbelievers, or regards their way as correct, is a disbeliever.\xa0\nWhoever believes that anything other than the teaching of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is more complete than his teachings , or that the rulings of anyone else are better than his rulings – such as those who prefer the rule of false laws to his rulings – is a disbeliever.\xa0\nWhoever hates any part of that which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) brought, even if he acts in accordance with it, is a disbeliever, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n\n“That is because they hate that which Allah has sent down (this Quran and Islamic laws); so He has made their deeds fruitless.”\xa0[Muhammad 47:9]\n\nWhoever makes fun of anything in the religion of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), or makes fun of any texts that refer to rewards or punishments, is a disbeliever. The evidence for that is the verse (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n\n“Say: Was it at Allah, and His Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) and His Messenger that you were mocking?\nMake no excuse; you disbelieved after you had believed.”\xa0[At-Tawbah 9:65-66]\n\nWitchcraft – including spells to turn one person against another or to make someone love another. Whoever does this or approves of it is a disbeliever. The evidence for that is the verse (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n\n“but neither of these two (angels) taught anyone (such things) till they had said, `We are for trial, so disbelieve not (by learning this magic from us).’”\xa0[Al-Baqarah 2:102]\n\nSupporting the polytheists and helping them against the Muslims. The evidence for that is the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n\n“O you who believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians as Awliya’ (friends, protectors, helpers), they are but Awliyaa’ of each other. And if any amongst you takes them (as Awliya’), then surely, he is one of them. Verily, Allah guides not those people who are the Dhalimun (polytheists and wrongdoers and unjust)”\xa0[Al-Ma'idah 5:51]\n\nWhoever believes that some people are allowed to operate outside the law of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) just as Al-Khidr operated outside the law of Musa (peace be upon him) is a disbeliever, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n\n“And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers.”\xa0[Al `Imran 3:85]\n\nTurning away from the religion of Allah, not learning it and not acting in accordance with it. The evidence for that is the verse (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n\n“And who does more wrong than he who is reminded of the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of his Lord, then turns aside therefrom? Verily, We shall exact retribution from the Mujrimon (criminals, disbelievers, polytheists, sinners).”\xa0[As-Sajdah 32:22]\nWith regard to all of these acts that nullify Islam, it makes no difference whether a person is joking, serious or afraid, unless he is forced to do it. All of them are very serious, and they all happen a great deal.\xa0\nThe Muslim should beware of them and fear falling into them. We seek refuge with Allah from the things that may incur His wrath and painful punishment. May Allah send blessings and peace upon the best of His creation, Muhammad, and upon his family and companions.\xa0\n\nThe fourth category includes those who believe that the systems and laws devised by men are better than the Shari`ah of Islam, or equal to it; or that it is permissible to refer to them for judgements and rulings, even if he believes that referring to Shari`ah is better; or that the Islamic system is not fit to be applied in the twentieth century; or that it was the cause of the Muslims’ backwardness; or that it should be limited to a person’s relationship with his Lord and not have anything to do with the other affairs of life\xa0\nThe fourth category also includes those who think that carrying out the ruling of Allah by cutting off the hand of the thief or stoning the married adulterer is not appropriate in the modern age.\xa0\nThat also includes: everyone who believes that it is permissible to rule according to something other than the laws of Allah with regard to interactions, hudud punishments or other matters, even if he does not believe that that is better than the ruling of Shari`ah, because by doing so he is regarding as permissible something that Allah has forbidden according to consensus, and everyone who regards as permissible something that Allah has forbidden and is well known to be forbidden in Islam, such that no Muslim has any excuse for not knowing that it is forbidden, such as adultery , alcohol and Riba , and ruling by something other than the Shari`ah of Allah, is a disbeliever according to the consensus of the Muslims.\xa0\n\nWe ask Allah to help us all to do that which pleases Him, and to guide us and all the Muslims to His Straight Path, for He is All Hearing, Ever-Responsive.
