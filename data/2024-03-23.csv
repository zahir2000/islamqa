405768,"My husband suffers from chronic dizziness due to vestibular neuritis, and during Ramadan, his condition worsens with fasting, and he is unable to stand for the Salah of Fajr due to severe dizziness and loss of balance. During bouts of dizziness, he becomes almost unconscious, does not respond to me, and is unable to comprehend what I say. My husband is a student of knowledge, devout in his religion, and all praise is due to Allah, and it saddens him that he cannot perform Salah, especially during Ramadan. I try to help him with Wudu’, and he prays while lying down, but sometimes the call to Fajr prayer comes while he is in a state of major ritual impurity, and he is unable to perform Ghusl, so he does not pray Fajr until after the dizziness ends, and sometimes the attack lasts from Fajr until Maghrib when he breaks his fast, then he makes up the missed prayers afterward. Is it better for him to break his fast during the bouts of dizziness so that he can perform Salah on time? And if he experiences an attack while in a state of major ritual impurity, is it permissible for him to perform only Wudu’ and pray to avoid missing the prayer time, or should he wait until he is able to perform Ghusl? He always tells me that he cannot concentrate or have the proper reverence in his Salah during an attack. He is confused about what to do; should he wait until the bout of dizziness ends, or should he continue to pray while lying down to preserve the prayer time?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIf fasting increases the likelihood of your husband experiencing dizziness, or prolongs its duration or intensity, then it is permissible for him to break his fast when he feels an onset of dizziness, and also to break the fast after the onset if it alleviates his condition.\nAllah the Exalted says (translation of the meaning): {O you who have believed, decreed upon you is fasting as it was decreed upon those before you that you may become righteous - [Fasting for] a limited number of days. So whoever among you is ill or on a journey [during them] - then an equal number of days [are to be made up].} (Al-Baqarah 2:183-184)\nThe illness that permits breaking the fast is one that causes evident hardship to the fasting person.\nAn-Nawawi said in ""Al-Majmu\'"" (6/261): ""The ill person who is unable to fast due to an illness that is hoped to pass is not obliged to fast... This is if he experiences evident hardship by fasting. It is not required that he reaches a state where he is unable to fast, but our companions have said: The condition for permitting breaking the fast is that he experiences hardship by fasting that is difficult to bear."" End quote.\nSheikh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: ""The sick person has different states:\nThe first: He is not affected by fasting, such as a minor cold, a slight headache, toothache, and the like, so it is not permissible for him to break the fast, although some Jurists say: It is permissible for him due to the generality of the verse {So whoever among you is ill} [Al-Baqarah 2:185], but we say: This ruling is qualified by a reason, which is that breaking the fast relieves a burden from him, so then we tell him to break the fast. But if he is not affected, then it is not permissible for him to break the fast and he must fast.\nThe second state: If fasting is difficult for him but does not harm him, then it is disliked for him to fast, and it is recommended for him to break the fast.\nThe third state: If fasting is difficult for him and harms him, like a person suffering from kidney disease or (certain types of) diabetes, and the like, then fasting for him is prohibited."" End quote from ""Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti\'"" (6/341).\nSecondly:\nIf he experiences a bout of dizziness while in a state of major ritual impurity, it is obligatory for him to perform Ghusl for Salah, and it is permissible for him to combine Dhuhr and `Asr, and Maghrib and `Isha, either by bringing them forward or delaying them. If the bout continues and he fears the time for Fajr, `Asr, or `Isha will expire, it is permissible for him to perform Tayammum; because he is sick and unable to use water, and he only delays the Salah to the end of its time in the hope that the bout will pass.\nThirdly:\nA person is required to pray standing, but if he cannot, then sitting, and if he cannot, then on his side; as reported by Al-Bukhari (1050) from `Imran ibn Husayn (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: ""I had hemorrhoids, so I asked the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) about the Salah, and he said: \'Pray standing, if you cannot, then sitting, and if you cannot, then on your side.\'""\nIt is not permissible for him to delay the Salah beyond its time except in the case of combining prayers.\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in ""Majmu` Al-Fatawa"" (24/14): ""The sick person and the one with continuous bleeding (mustahadah) may combine prayers."" End quote.\nLack of concentration or devotion does not harm him.\nWe ask Allah to heal him, grant him well-being, and reward him for his affliction.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/405768/chronic-dizziness-while-fasting
190411,One of my close friends committed Zina during the day in Ramadan with a non-Muslim young man when she was twenty years old. Now she is twenty-nine and is very sad about what she did. She wants to know what exactly she should do so that that mistake may be forgiven.,"['Praise be to Allah.Is Zina a major sin?\nThere is no doubt that Zina (fornication or adultery) is a major sin and is something that incurs the wrath and anger of Allah. If Zina was committed with a non-Muslim, the sin is greater, and if that was during the day in Ramadan , that is even worse. If the person who committed the sin does not repent sincerely from the bottom of his heart, then his loss is complete.\xa0\nAllah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And those who invoke not any other Ilah (god) along with Allah, nor kill such life as Allah has forbidden, except for just cause, nor commit illegal sexual intercourse and whoever does this shall receive the punishment. The torment will be doubled to him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein in disgrace; Except those who repent and believe (in Islamic Monotheism), and do righteous deeds , for those, Allah will change their sins into good deeds, and Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” [Al-Furqan 25:68-70]\n“Say: O My slaves who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allah, verily Allah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” [Az-Zumar 39:53]\nDespite the abhorrent nature and severity of Zina and the fact that the one who committed it is exposed to the wrath and anger of Allah, the mercy of Allah precedes His wrath, so He does not hasten to punish His slave; rather He opens to him the gate of repentance and gives him time to repent. If he repents and is sincere , Allah will forgive him, no matter what his sin was.\xa0\nWhat this young woman must do is be sincere towards Allah in her repentance, regret having committed this abhorrent action , resolve never to commit this sin again, and do a lot of righteous deeds. She should turn to her Lord, thinking positively of Him, being sincere towards Him and repenting fully to Him. Allah accepts the repentance of His slaves and grants pardon for bad deeds.\xa0\nWhat happens if you commit Zina in Ramadan?\nThe one who committed Zina during the day in Ramadan has to, along with repenting, make up that day’s fast and offer the severe expiation , which is to free a slave; if he cannot do that, then he must fast for two consecutive months; and if he cannot do that, he must feed sixty poor persons.\xa0\nThe one who committed Zina several years ago and has not made up the fasts that he missed also, in addition to the above, has to offer expiation for delaying the making up of that day’s fast, which is to feed one poor person; the amount to be given is half a Sa` of the local staple food, wheat or rice and so on. That is equivalent to one and a half kilograms.\xa0\nThe Standing Committee was asked:\xa0\nWhat is the ruling on one who committed Zina during the day in Ramadan? That took place at the time when he was ignorant and now he is asking Allah for forgiveness.\xa0\nThey replied:\xa0\n“The questioner has to repent and must offer expiation, which is to free a slave; if he cannot do that, then he must fast for two consecutive months; if he cannot do that, then he has to feed sixty poor persons. He also has to make up the fast of that day on which he broke the fast, and he has to offer expiation for the delay in making up that day’s fast, which is one and a half kilograms of wheat.” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 9/255)\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/190411/what-happens-if-you-commit-zina-in-ramadan
406308,What's the ruling on applying Steroid (Triamcinolone Acetonide) ointment / paste within oral cavity for the treatment of Apthous Ulcer while fasting?,"['Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible for a fasting person to use steroid ointment to treat mouth ulcers while fasting; because the ointment (gel) dissolves in the mouth, mixes with saliva, and it is not possible to avoid swallowing it.\nThis ulcer does not cause difficulty that would allow for breaking the fast.\nAn-Nawawi said in ""Al-Majmu`"" (6/261): ""The person who is unable to fast because of a sickness which he hopes will go away is not obliged to fast. This applies if he encounters obvious difficulty in fasting and is not subject to the condition that he reaches a point when he is unable to fast. Rather our companions said: The permission not to fast is subject to the condition that fasting causes him difficulties that it is hard for him to bear.”\xa0\nFor further benefit, please see the answer to question number: (188934 ).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/406308/ruling-on-steroid-ointment-for-mouth-ulcers-while-fasting
