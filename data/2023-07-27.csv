222344,What is the ruling on putting books on top of the Mushaf?,"['Praise be to Allah.The scholars are unanimously agreed that it is obligatory to protect and respect the Mushaf, and it is prohibited to expose it to mistreatment and mishandling. Undoubtedly respecting and venerating the Mushaf comes under the heading of venerating the symbols of Allah. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{That [is so]. And whoever honors the symbols of Allah - indeed, it is from the piety of hearts}\xa0[al-Hajj 22:32].\nSecondly:\nThere is nothing wrong with putting one Mushaf on top of another. Ibn Hajar al-Haytami (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIt is permissible to put one Mushaf on top of another.\nEnd quote from al-Fatawa al-Hadithiyyah (p. 164).\nAs for putting another book – or books – other than the Mushaf on top of the Mushaf, that is not allowed, and the least that may be said concerning it is that it is disliked (makruh).\nAl-Hakim at-Tirmidhi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nPart of respecting it – meaning the Mushaf – if it is put down, is not leaving it open, and not putting any other books on top of it, so that it will always be on top of other books.\nAl-Bayhaqi (may Allah have mercy on him) said, discussing the etiquette to be observed with the Book of Allah:\n… No other book, no garment nor anything else should be placed on top of the Mushaf, unless there are two Mushafs, one of which is placed on top of the other; that is permissible.""(Shu‘ab al-Iman\xa0 3/329).\nSee also: al-Fatawa al-Hadithiyyah (p. 164).\nShaykh ‘Abd al-Karim al-Khudayr (may Allah preserve him) was asked:\nWhat is the ruling on putting books on top of the Mushaf?\nHe replied:\nThe Qur’an is the word of Allah – this applies to what is between the covers of the Mushaf – and the word of Allah must be respected. It is not permissible to show disrespect to it under any circumstances, and the one who shows disrespect to the Qur’an is in grave danger, because he has shown disrespect to the One Who spoke these words, namely Allah, may He be glorified and exalted.\nIf putting other books on top of the Mushaf was done unintentionally, then the one who forgets or does something by mistake is pardoned.\nIf it was done out of ignorance, the one who is ignorant is also excused.\nBut if it was done knowingly and deliberately, that is not permitted, because it is a type of disrespect.""(Sharh ‘Umdat al-Ahkam\xa035/17).\nIf it appears to be the case, based on the nature of what is placed on top of the Mushaf, that that things was put there to protect it, and the Mushaf is a means of protecting it, or the thing that is placed on top of the Mushaf is something that is usually treated with disrespect, then undoubtedly that is prohibited, because in both of these cases, and similar cases, it is clearly disrespect towards the Book of Allah, and that is undoubtedly haram.\nFor more information, please see the answers to questions no. 95753 and 125930 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/222344/ruling-on-putting-books-on-top-of-the-mushaf
262066,"My father died fourteen years ago. He used to work as a teacher, and the organisation for which he worked put money for me in a bank account. When I reached the age of majority (twenty-one years), the court allowed me to take this money out of the bank. I went to the bank to take out this money, and I found that the money had almost doubled because it had been in the bank for fourteen years. Does this additional amount come under the heading of riba, and what should I do with such money?","['Praise be to Allah.I put this question to our shaykh, ‘Abd ar-Rahman al-Barrak (may Allah preserve him), and he advised:\nIf the money that the organisation put in the riba-based bank was outstanding dues owed to your father, then it is the legacy of your father, so it is not permissible for you to take this extra amount. Rather you must get rid of it by donating it to various charitable causes, unless you are in need, in which case you may take of it as much as you need.\nBut if the money was a gift from this organisation, then you may take it in full, because it did not come into your possession before that, and you did not receive it, and you will not be asked about the interest that has been added to it. Rather the sin of that is on those who put the money in the riba-based bank.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/262066/ruling-on-accepting-interest-paid-by-the-bank-on-money-that-the-bank-held-for-the-heirs-until-they-reached-the-age-of-majority
