507039,"I bought some crypto currency and put it on a website. This website uses a robot which searches by itself for the cheapest crypto currency, then buys this crypto currency using my account. Then it sells it on another platform where the price of crypto currency is high, and gives me the difference between the two prices. Is this wealth halal?","['Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with using a robot to deal in real currency or crypto currency, meaning that the robot takes care of searching for the lowest price for crypto currency and buys it, then it sells it on the same platform or a different platform when the price is high. That is on condition that the exchange be immediate, meaning that the currency that has been purchased enters the dealer’s account immediately, and the currency that has been sold enters the other party’s account immediately.\nThat is because currencies come under the same ruling as gold and silver. So if one currency is sold for another, it is stipulated that the exchange take place immediately, as is required when gold is sold for silver.\nIt was narrated that ‘Ubadah ibn as-Samit (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “: “Gold for gold, silver for silver, wheat for wheat, barley for barley, dates for dates, salt for salt, like for like, same for same, hand to hand. But if these commodities differ, then sell as you like, as long as it is hand to hand [that is, exchanged immediately].” Narrated by Muslim (1587).\nIt said in a statement of the Islamic Fiqh Council belonging to the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC):\nWith regard to the rulings on paper currencies, they are legal tender by which prices are measured, and they come under the established Islamic rulings on gold and silver with regard to matters such as riba (usury), zakah, payment in advance (salam transaction) and so on.\nEnd quote from Majallat al-Majma‘ (issue no. 3, vol. 3, p. 1650; issue no. 5, vol. 3, p. 1609).\nIn this case, the robot takes the place of the agent with regard to buying, selling and receiving.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/507039/is-trading-in-crypto-currency-by-using-a-robot-valid
146713,"I pray the noon prayer on campus, but my classes start before noon and end after the afternoon prayer is performed, with not enough time between classes, so I pray the noon prayer only without the stressed practices for lack of time. If I arrive at class after the professor, I am not allowed to attend the class. Sometimes, I don't even have enough time to get to the place of prayer, so I pray in a secluded space inside the hall.","['Praise be to Allah.It is prescribed to make up the regular Sunnah prayers (As-sunan Ar-rawatib ) if they are missed because of an excuse such as sleeping, forgetting or being too busy to do them, which led to one not offering them at the proper time.\xa0\nSo they may be made up even at times when prayer is not allowed , according to the correct scholarly opinion. That is because of the report narrated by Al-Bukhari (1233) and Muslim (834) from Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her), according to which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) prayed two Rak`ahs after `Asr; she asked him about that and he said, “Some people from `Abd Al-Qays came to me and distracted me from offering the two Rak`ahs that come after Dhuhr , so these are they.”\xa0\nAnd Ibn Majah (1154) narrated that Qays ibn `Amr said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) saw a man praying two Rak`ahs after Fajr. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Fajr prayer twice?” The man said to him: I did not pray the two Rak`ahs that come before it, so I prayed them (now). And the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not say anything. (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah, 948)\xa0\nAnd At-Tirmidhi (426) narrated from `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that if the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not pray four Rak`ahs before Dhuhr, he would pray them afterwards. (Classed as sound by Al-Al-Albani in Sahih At-Tirmidhi)\xa0\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“The correct view in our opinion is that it is recommended to make up the regular Sunnah prayers . This is the view of Muhammad, Al-Muzani, and Ahmad according to one report. Abu Hanifah, Malik and Abu Yusuf, according to the more well-known report from them, said: ""They should not be made up; our evidence is these authentic Hadiths.” (Al-Majmu`, 4/43)\nAl-Mardawi Al-Hanbali (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“The words “and whoever misses any of these Sunnah prayers , it is prescribed for him to make them up”– this is our madhhab (the madhhab of Imam Ahmad) and is the well-known view according to our companions.” (Al-Insaf, 2/187)\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“If one of the regular Sunnah prayers, such as the Sunnah prayer of Dhuhr, is missed, can it be made up after `Asr? There are two views, both of which were narrated from Ahmad. One of them is that it may not be made up; this is the view of Abu Hanifah and Malik. The other view is that it may be made up. This is the view of Ash-Shafi`i and it is stronger. And Allah knows best.” (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 23/127)\xa0\nBased on the above, if you are not able to offer the regular Sunnah prayers before and after Dhuhr at the proper time, it is prescribed for you to offer them after `Asr.\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Is it permissible to delay the Sunnah prayer that is offered before Dhuhr, as we start Dhuhr prayer, then after approximately one hour we offer the Sunnah prayers that come before and after, because the time allowed for us to pray where we are studying outside the Kingdom is only enough to do Wudu’ and offer the (obligatory) prayer only?\xa0\nHe replied:\xa0\n“If a person delays the Sunnah prayer that should be offered before until after the prayer , if that is because of an excuse then there is nothing wrong with him making it up later on, and it is acceptable. But if he had no excuse, then it is not acceptable. What the questioner has mentioned about the time only being enough to do Wudu’ and offer the obligatory prayer is an excuse; based on that, it is permissible to make up the Sunnah prayer that should come before after the prayer , but in this case one should start with the Sunnah that comes after the obligatory prayer, then make up the Sunnah that comes before.” (Fatawa wa Rasa’il Ibn `Uthaymin, 14/194)\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/146713/making-up-a-missed-dhuhr-sunnah-prayer-after-asr
511279,"My father and I do not have a good relationship, because his wife does not like us, and he has been unfair to us in all ways. A while ago I got to know a family, all of whom follow are Sunnis, except the mother and father, who follow a different school of thought. The children are all good in terms of religious commitment and character, and one of the sons has proposed marriage to me. I had no choice but to tell my father, so that he could give me in marriage, but he refused, because the mother and father do not follow our school of thought, but the suitor does follow my school of thought. My father did not do that out of concern for me; rather he said that his reputation would become tarnished if people found out. I want to marry this man, and he is a suitable match for me, because he is religiously committed, of good character and wealthy. Is the school of thought of the mother or father of the suitor a valid reason for refusing to let their son marry me, or does my father have no right to reject him? Please note that he is a righteous man and I want to marry him.","['Praise be to Allah.If the father refuses to give his daughter in marriage to a young man who is of good character and religiously committed because his parents are not Sunnis, then his rejection is valid, and is not regarded as preventing his daughter from getting married, because marriage is a strong bond between the spouses and their families. Her father will have no choice but to interact with the father of this young man, and his parents will become grandparents to your children. The fact that the parents follow a path other than the Sunni path is most likely to bring shame on you, your family and your children, and there is the possibility of conflict and dispute in the future. So your father is not to be blamed for rejecting this marriage.\nNo matter how estranged the father is from his daughter, his paternal compassion will prompt him to make a good choice for her.\nIf we assume that his concern is for his reputation only, he has the right to be concerned and not agree to a marriage that will tarnish his reputation or undermine it. Hence Islam gives weight to the matter of compatibility between the spouses, and gives the right to all the guardians of the woman to reject a marriage to one who is not compatible, because the shame will affect all of them.\nIt says in Kashshaf al-Qina‘ (5/67):\nCompatibility is the right of the woman and of all the guardians, whether they are closely or distantly related to her, and it is even the right of guardians who may be born after the marriage contract has been done, because they will all be shamed equally if there is no compatibility.\nIf a one’s marriage is arranged to someone who is not compatible with her, then anyone who is not pleased with the marriage has the right to nullify it – including the woman and any of her guardians – who may express their disapproval immediately or later on, because the option to nullify is there due to shortcomings in the one with whom the marriage contract was done. This is akin to the option of proceeding with a sale transaction or cancelling it. The more distantly-related guardian has the right to annul the marriage with the approval of the one who is more closely related, and with the approval of the wife, so as to ward off what the more distantly-related guardian could face of shame.\nSo if the father gives his daughter in marriage to someone who is not compatible, with her consent, her brothers can nullify it – as stated – because they will all carry the burden of shame resulting from the marriage of a female relative to someone who is incompatible. End quote.\nConclusion:\nThe difference in schools of thought is clearly a shortcoming in the family of the suitor, and it may bring blame and shame on you and your family.\nOr it may not lead to that in some places and some communities. But if the father rejects the marriage for this reason, then his rejection is valid.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/511279/can-the-father-refuse-to-give-his-daughter-in-marriage-to-a-young-man-who-is-good-in-terms-of-character-and-religious-commitment-because-his-parents-are-not-sunni
