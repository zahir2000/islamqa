396699,"Do the family of a potential wife have the right to ask the suitor, at the time of proposal, about his salary and exactly how much he earns?","['Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with the guardian of the woman asking about the salary of the suitor and his level of income, because the guardian is acting in the interests of the woman, and one of her interests is that she should marry a man who can afford to spend on her.\nIt was narrated from ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Each of you is in a position of responsibility and each of you is answerable for those under his care. The ruler of the people is in a position of responsibility and is answerable for those under his care. A man is in a position of responsibility over his household and is answerable for those under his care.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (2554) and Muslim (1829).\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) indicates that guardianship is a trust, the requirements of which must be fulfilled… The Muslims are unanimously agreed on what this means: the one who is a guardian of an orphan, the one who is the trustee of a waqf (endowment) and the one who is appointed to look after another person’s property and act as his proxy, must do what is in the best interests, then the next best interests, of that which is under his care, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And do not approach the orphan\'s property except in a way that is best\xa0…” [al-An‘am 6:152}, and He did not say “except in a good way.”""(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa\xa0 28/250-251).\nThe Sunnah indicates that it is permissible for a man to marry a woman for her wealth, and by the same token it is permissible for a woman to marry a man for his wealth, even though the foremost concern should be the level of religious commitment of the other partner.\nIt was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah have mercy on him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “A woman may be married for four things: her wealth, her lineage, her beauty and her religious commitment. Choose the one who is religiously-committed, may your hands be rubbed with dust (i.e., may you prosper).”\xa0 Narrated by al-Bukhari (5090) and Muslim (1466).\nAbu’l-‘Abbas al-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe words “A woman may be married for four things: her wealth, her lineage, her beauty and her religious commitment” mean: These are four characteristics that encourage a man to marry a woman, and they are what men seek in women. This is describing what happens in real life; it is not a command to look for these things. What appears to be the case is that it is permissible to marry a woman who has all of these characteristics, or one of them. However, seeking one who is religiously committed is best and most important, hence he said: “Choose the one who is religiously-committed, may your hands be rubbed with dust (i.e., may you prosper).”""(Al-Mufhim\xa0\xa04/215).\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nMoreover, if one of the two partners stipulates a particular characteristic in the other – such as wealth, beauty, virginity and the like – that is valid, and the one who stipulates that has the right to nullify the marriage if that condition is not met, according to the more sound of the two reports from Ahmad, the more sound of the two views of the companions of al-Shafa‘i, and what appears to be the view of Malik…""(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa\xa0 29/175).\nIt is proven that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) suggested to Fatimah bint Qays that she should reject the proposal of Mu‘awiyah ibn Abi Sufyan, when he proposed marriage to her, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) gave as the reason for that: “he is poor and has no wealth.” Narrated by Muslim (1480).\nAll of this evidence indicates that it is permissible for the guardian to ask this question, and there is nothing wrong with that, but it should be done with wisdom, because many people think that the details of a person’s salary is a private matter, and they do not like to talk about it in detail, for fear that the marriage may not take place. It is also possible to find out about the suitor’s financial standing by asking about the nature of his work and what his job is.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/396699/ruling-on-asking-a-suitor-about-the-amount-of-his-monthly-salary
145160,"I wanted to know how many times can a person eat during the whole day. In the Quran it reads “O Children of Adam! Take your adornment to every Masjid, and eat and drink, but waste not by extravagance, certainly He (Allah) likes not the wasteful” [7:31].","['Praise be to Allah.What does Islam say about extravagance?\nExtravagance is blameworthy in eating and other things. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And eat and drink but waste not by extravagance, certainly He (Allâh) likes not Al-Musrifûn (those who waste by extravagance).” [Al-A`raf 7:31]\xa0\n“And waste not by extravagance. Verily, He likes not Al-Musrifûn (those who waste by extravagance).” [Al-An`am 6:141]\xa0\n“And let not your hand be tied (like a miser) to your neck, nor stretch it forth to its utmost reach (like a spendthrift), so that you become blameworthy and in severe poverty.” [Al-Isra’ 17:29]\xa0\n“And give to the kinsman his due and to the Miskîn (poor) and to the wayfarer. But spend not wastefully (your wealth) in the manner of a spendthrift. Verily, spendthrifts are brothers of the devils, and the satan is ever ungrateful to his Lord.” [Al-Isra’ 17:26-27]\xa0\nThe difference between extravagance and wasteful spending is that extravagance means spending on something appropriate in an excessive manner, whereas wasteful spending means spending on something that is not appropriate. This was stated by Al-Munawi in Fayd Al-Qadir, 1/50\nIs overeating prohibited in Islam?\nExtravagance leads to overstepping the mark, which means eating beyond the point of fullness. This is not limited to one or two or three meals a day . A person may eat one meal a day and eat extravagantly during that meal. Or he may eat three meals without being extravagant.\xa0\nThe Hadith of Al-Miqdad (may Allah be pleased with him) encourages eating small amounts of food and being content with that which is enough to keep one going. It does not suggest the number of meals. These few mouthfuls may be eaten at three times, at breakfast, lunch and dinner, and he will be eating little in these meals. If he wants to eat more than a few mouthfuls – in his meal – he should leave one third (of his stomach) for his food, one third for his drink, and one third for air. If he needs another meal – as is the case for most people – there is nothing wrong with that, but he should pay attention to the same points noted above. The same applies if he needs to have three or four meals. The number of meals varies from one person to another, the type of food and the effort necessary to prepare it.\xa0\nWhat matters is taking care of the body and not causing any harm, whether by overeating or starving.\xa0\nWhat also matters is eating to have strength to carry out acts of worship, which is achieved by eating moderate amounts, not by eating heavy amounts or going too hungry.\xa0\nIt says in Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah (25/332):\xa0\n“Part of the etiquette of eating is to be moderate in eating and not to fill the stomach. The most that is acceptable in this regard is for the Muslim to divide his stomach into three parts: one third for food, one third for drink and one third for air, because of the Hadith: “The son of Adam does not fill any vessel worse than his stomach. It is enough for the son of Adam to eat a few mouthfuls to keep him going, but if he must (fill his stomach), then one third for his food, one third for his drink and one third for air.” That will lead to a lean and light body, because eating one’s fill leads to heaviness, which makes one too lazy to do acts of worship and strive. When we say one third of the stomach, it means limiting oneself to one third of what one would have to eat one’s fill, and it was said that this may be done by limiting it to one half of a Mudd. But Al-Nafrawi favoured the former view, because of differences among people. All of this applies to one who will not become weak as a result of eating less than his fill, otherwise it is better for him to eat that which will give him energy to worship and will be physically appropriate for him.``\nCategories of eating in Islam\nIn Al-Fatawa Al-Hindiyyah it says: Eating falls into different categories:\xa0\nObligatory – which is what will ward off death. If a person stops eating and drinking until he dies, then he has committed a sin.\nThat which is rewarded – which is what will give him more energy so that he is able to pray standing up and makes it easy for him to fast.\nPermissible – which is more than that, to the point of eating one’s fill, so that he will have more physical strength. There is no reward for this and it is not regarded as sinful. He will be brought to account for it but the reckoning will be light if the food was permissible.\nProhibited – this refers to eating more than one’s fill unless the intention is to have the strength to fast the following day or so as not to embarrass a guest, in which case there is nothing wrong with eating more than one’s fill.\xa0\nIbn Al-Hajj (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Eating in and of itself falls into different categories: obligatory, recommended, permissible, disliked and forbidden.\nThat which is obligatory is that which will keep him going so that he can fulfil his obligatory duties towards his Lord, because that which is essential to doing something obligatory is also obligatory.\nThat which is recommended is that which will help him to do optional acts of worship, acquire knowledge and do other acts of obedience.\nThat which is permissible is that which enables one to fill one’s stomach in the manner prescribed in Shari`ah.\nThat which is disliked is that which is a little more than is enough to fill the stomach but does not harm one.\nThat which is forbidden is eating a great deal that is harmful to the body.\xa0\nAl-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is disliked to eat more permissible food than is enough to satisfy one.\xa0\nThe Hanbalis said: “It is permissible to eat a great deal so long as it does not harm one. In Al-Ghuniyah it says: It is disliked when there is the fear of indigestion. It was narrated from Ibn Taymiyah that it is disliked to eat that which leads to indigestion; it was also narrated from him that doing this is prohibited.” \xa0\nWhat is extravagance in eating?\xa0\nFrom the above it is clear that there is nothing wrong with eating more than one meal a day and that, on its own, it is not regarded as extravagance; rather extravagance is eating more than is enough to fill one’s stomach even if that is in one meal.\xa0\nAmong the evidence that it is permissible to eat enough to fill one’s stomach and that what is disliked or prohibited is going beyond that limit is the report narrated by Al-Bukhari (5381) and Muslim (2040) from Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: Abu Talhah said to Umm Sulaym: I have heard the voice of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) sounding weak, and I know that he is hungry. Do you have anything? … This is a story of food being increased in quantity by virtue of the supplication of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), in which he said: “Give permission for ten to enter.” He gave them permission and they ate until they were full, then they left. Then he said: “Give permission for ten to enter.” He gave them permission and they ate until they were full, then they left. Then he said: “Give permission for ten to enter.” He gave them permission and they ate until they were full, then they left. Then he gave permission to ten more to enter, and all the people ate, and ate their fill, and there were eighty men.\xa0\nAl-Bukhari\xa0 (may Allah have mercy on him) included this report in a chapter entitled: Chapter on one who eats his fill.\xa0\nIn this chapter he also narrated that `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) died when we had eaten our fill of the two black ones: dates and water.\xa0\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Ibn Battal said: From these Hadiths we see that it is permissible to eat one’s fill, although not doing so sometimes is preferable. … At-Tabari said: But eating one’s fill, even though it is permissible, has its limits, and anything beyond that is extravagance. That which is permissible of it is that which helps the eater to obey his Lord and its heaviness does not distract him from doing what is enjoined upon him. Al-Qurtubi said in Al-Mufhim, after mentioning the story of Abu Al-Haytham, when he slaughtered a sheep for the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his two Companions and they ate until they were full: In (this report) there is evidence that it is permissible to eat one’s fill, and the reports which say that it is not allowed are to be understood as referring to fullness that weighs heavily in the stomach and makes a person slow to do acts of worship, and leads to feeling sleepy and lazy. Though it is disliked, it may go so far as being prohibited according to the negative consequences that result from it.” (Fath Al-Bari)\xa0\nThe way you described your breakfast, lunch and dinner is not regarded as extravagance; rather they may be small, compared to what people are used to. But you know yourself best and what is best suited to your body’s needs.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/145160/is-overeating-prohibited
244044,"A man used to shorten his prayers when travelling, and he even used to shorten Maghrib prayer.

Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIt is permissible to shorten Zuhr, ‘Asr and ‘Isha’ when travelling, but it is not permissible to shorten Fajr or Maghrib, and it is not permissible to shorten prayers when not travelling. There is scholarly consensus on all of that.""(Al-Majmu‘\xa0 4/322).\nIf someone used to shorten Maghrib when travelling out of ignorance, he must repent from having fallen short in learning what is required of him, but does he have to repeat the prayers he offered?\nThere are two views concerning that among the scholars:\nThe first view is that he does not have to repeat the prayers, as he is excused because of his ignorance.\nThe second view is that he must make up the Maghrib prayers that he shortened, because they are not valid. This was the view of a number of jurists. If he does not know the number of prayers, he should pray as many as he thinks most likely to be required to absolve himself.\nThe view that is more likely to be correct regarding that is that the one who was ignorant is not required to repeat his prayers, as is proven in the Sunnah in many instances. This is the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him).\nPlease see the answers to question\xa0no. 45648\xa0.\nIf you make up these prayers, by way of erring on the side of caution and so as to avoid differing with the scholars who said that it is obligatory to make them up, that is a good idea and is more likely to absolve you of responsibility.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/244044/he-used-to-shorten-maghrib-prayer-when-travelling-out-of-ignorance-does-he-have-to-repeat-those-prayers
102851,"I have a serious problem. I was learning more about Islam, but now, as exams are drawing near, I am developing unutterable doubts and confusion. What I mean is doubts such as: was Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) really a prophet? And things of this nature. I can no longer focus on my studies. Please advise me.","['Praise be to Allah.It is good that you are worried about yourself, it is good that you are upset about what you are suffering from, and it is good that you have written to us, asking for advice. This indicates that your heart is alert and cautious. We ask Allah to help you to do that which pleases Him.\nIssues related to Devilish whispers in Islam\nThis state in which you find yourself is what is called OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder). We would like to reassure you and lift your spirits by noting the following:\n\nThese whispers have no implications, and no rulings are based on them. Therefore no divorce is valid, no oath is binding, no state of purity is rendered invalid, and no Muslim becomes an apostate if the whispers have to do with some fundamentals of belief. So if a person is overwhelmed with whispers to the point that he begins to doubt the existence of Allah or his belief in the Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), none of that has any impact on him, and the ruling of his being a Muslim remains valid. Therefore you may rest assured, and let the devil die in his distress and suppression.\n\nAbu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has forgiven my Ummah for whatever whispers [Waswasah] cross their minds so long as they do not act upon it or speak of it.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 2391, and Muslim, 127)\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“What we may understand is that there is no blame for what crosses a person’s mind, unless it is translated into actions or words as a result of that thought. What is meant by whispers is when a thought resides in a person’s mind without him feeling happy with it, or it takes root in his mind.” (Fat-h Al-Bari, 5/161)\nFor some important details mentioned by Shaykh Al-’Uthaymin, please see the answer to question no.\xa010160 , where he stated that no harm will befall a Muslim if he experiences compulsive whispers about Allah and His existence, or about His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) or His religion.\n\nThese whispers are indicative – in sha Allah – of strong faith and certainty, because of which the devil is eager to subject you to this Waswasah . Were it not that he sees that you have strong faith and are righteous, he would not have resorted to this method of whispering, especially since you regard as abhorrent the thoughts that he is trying to instil in your mind.\n\nWe are not saying that just to be nice to you; rather this is what the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) stated, and it is what the trustworthy scholars of this Ummah understood from the Hadiths.\nAbu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The devil may come to one of you and say: ‘Who created such and such, who created such and such?’ Until he says to him: ‘Who created your Lord? ’ If it goes that far, let him seek refuge with Allah and stop (such thoughts).” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 3102, and Muslim, 134).\nAccording to a report narrated by Muslim, “…let him say, ‘I believe in Allah and His Messenger.’”\nAccording to another report from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), he said: Some of the companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came and asked him: We find in our hearts thoughts that are too awful for any of us to speak of them. He said: “Do you really find that?” They said: Yes. He said: “That is [a sign of] clear faith.”.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“What this means is that the devil only resorts to whispering to those whom he despairs of ever misleading. So he tries to annoy them with his whispers, because he is unable to misguide them. As for the disbeliever, he can lead him in any direction he wants, and in that case he is not limited to whispering; rather he toys with him however he wishes. This is what the Hadith means: the cause of the Waswasah is strong faith or, in other words, Waswasah is indicative of a person’s strong faith. This is the view favoured by Al-Qadi `Iyad.” (Sharh Muslim, 2/154)\nHow to get rid of Devilish whispers\nThe remedy for this Waswasah is very simple. All you have to do is adhere to the instructions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to stop going along with those whispers, ignore them , seek refuge with Allah , say “I believe in Allah,” and distract yourself from it by glorifying Allah, may He be Exalted, remembering Him and calling upon Him, and sending blessings upon the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“With regard to the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “let him seek refuge with Allah and stop (such thoughts)”, what is meant is: If he is faced with these whispers, let him turn to Allah, may He be Exalted, to help him ward off this evil. He should stop thinking about it and should realise that this thought is one of the whispers of the Shaytaan , who is only trying to corrupt him and mislead him. So let him stop listening to these whispers and hasten to put a stop to it by focusing on something else. And Allah knows best.” (Sharh Muslim, 2/155-156)\nThe scholars of the Standing Committee were asked:\nI am a young Muslim man who has recently become religiously committed, and the Shaytan is causing me a great deal of trouble. Every time I manage to overcome one thing, he presents me with another obstacle. After I attained a level of religious commitment and I thought – praise be to Allah – that I was a little better than those around me, I began to see those who I had thought were less committed than me as now being better than me, and doing more righteous deeds than me; I look at myself and I find myself to be going downhill fast, drifting away from the level of commitment that I had achieved. I am trying to resist my evil inclinations and the Shaytan by all possible means, but I cannot find anyone who appreciates my pain and the suffering that I am enduring silently, or anyone I can talk to about the evil thoughts that the Shaytan is putting into my mind. These whispers do not leave me even for a minute, no matter what I do or where I am, in the mosque, in the street, at home or in school. Is there anyone who could stand by me and help me against this Shaytan? Is there anyone whom Allah might inspire to help me?\nThey replied:\n“We advise you to ignore these whispers and to pay no attention to them, to read a great deal of Quran, do a lot of righteous deeds, and turn to Allah, beseeching Him and calling upon Him to ward off from you the tricks of the Shaytan, to make you steadfast in adhering to the truth, and to guide you. For He, may He be Glorified, is in control of all creatures, both jinn and humans, and He directs them as He wills.\xa0\nBeware of being filled with self-admiration because of your worship , or being deceived by your good behaviour and conduct or your many righteous deeds.\nWhen it comes to matters of worship and issues connected to the Hereafter, do not look at those who are less than you, for that will lead to you developing self-admiration and will cause you to do fewer righteous deeds and to become slow in doing them; it will cause the Shaytan to toy with you and discourage you from doing good. Rather you should look at those who are better than you in adhering to the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\xa0\nCling to that and be keen to adhere to it, for that will motivate you to increase your righteous deeds and help you to attain the forgiveness and mercy of Allah, and a high position in Paradise, and everlasting bliss. Perhaps Allah will make you steadfast in adhering to the truth and will guide you to the straight path, and will relieve you of this Waswasah.\nWe also advise you to read the book Talbis Iblis, by Abu Al-Faraj ibn Al-Jawzi, in which he discusses this issue. We hope that Allah will benefit you thereby.” (Shaykh `Abd Al-`Azeez ibn Baz, Shaykh `Abd Ar-Razzaq `Afeefi, Shaykh `Abdullah ibn Ghadyan, Shaykh `Abdullah ibn Qa`ud, Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 2/194)\nYou should not worry, after reading these glad tidings and reassuring words, for all you have to do now is follow the advice of the scholars, which is based on the advice of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). We ask Allah to protect you from the Shaytaan and to make what is good easy for you, wherever it may be.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/102851/how-to-get-rid-of-devilish-whispers
