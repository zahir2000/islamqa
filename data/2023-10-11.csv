This is what a specialist told us.\nIt says on the website of the Cooperative for the Development of the Apiculture Industry in Riyadh:\nHoney Fermentation\n\nHoney will ferment if the moisture in it increases beyond 19-21%, especially when cutting away honey that is not ripe, or adding water to it.\nRipe honey could be preserved for a long time without fermentation. As for honey that is not ripe, or honey that is kept in places where moisture is high, it is exposed to the risk of fermentation due to the impact of some yeasts that carry high concentrations of sugar. The sources of these yeasts include pollen, air and dust.\nThe yeasts that are present in honey may secrete enzymes that turn sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. These alcohols may be broken down, due to the effect of bacteria and oxygen in the air, into acetic acid and water.\nFermented honey loses its natural smell and taste, and develops a sour smell. Foam and air bubbles may develop in it. End quote.\n\nConclusion:\nIf pure honey is stored correctly, it will not ferment.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/312121/when-does-honey-ferment-and-how-can-we-tell-that-it-has-fermented
12601,"If someone reaches Jumu`ah during the Tashahhud, what should he do? If someone is held up by something out of his control eg. bus breaks down... is he sinful if he is late to Jumu`ah or misses it? Does he miss out on the rewards he would have gotten and the moment of the acceptance of Du`a, etc.?","['Praise be to Allah.How to catch up with Friday prayer\nYou can only catch up with the Jumu`ah prayer if you catch a Rak`ah with the Imam, and catching a Rak`ah means catching up with the Ruku` with the Imam.\nIf you catch up with the Imam before he stands up from Ruku` in the second Rak`ah, then you have caught up with the prayer, and you should then complete your prayer after the Imam says the Salam. You should stand up and complete the remaining Rak`ah of your prayer.\xa0\nHowever, if you catch up with the Imam after he has stood up from Ruku`, this means that you have missed the Jumu`ah prayer, and have not caught up with it. In this case you have to pray it as Zuhr. You should stand up after the Imam has said the Salam and complete your prayer with four Rak`ahs, because it is Zuhr and not Jumu`ah.\xa0\nThis is the view of the majority of scholars, Malik, Al-Shafi`i and Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on them). (See Al-Majmu’ by Al-Nawawi, 4/558)\nThey quoted several texts as evidence, such as:\xa0\n\nThe words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Whoever catches up with one Rak`ah of the prayer has caught up with the prayer.” (Al-Bukhari, 580; Muslim, 607).\xa0\nThe report narrated by Al-Nasa’i from ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Whoever catches up with one Rak`ah of Jumu`ah or any other prayer, let him add more Rak`ahs to it to complete his prayer.’” (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Al-Irwa’, 622).\xa0\n\nMissing the prayer for a valid excuse\nIf a person does not catch up with the prayer for a reason that is beyond his control, such as the bus breaking down, as mentioned in the question, or other excuses such as oversleeping or forgetting, then there is no sin on him in that case, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And there is no sin on you concerning that in which you made a mistake, except in regard to what your hearts deliberately intend” [Al-Ahzab 33:5]\nA person in such cases does not deliberately intend to miss the prayer .\xa0\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has forgiven my Ummah for what they forget and what they do by mistake, and for what they are forced to do.” (Narrated by Ibn Majah; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Al-Irwa’, 82)\xa0\nIn this case, if one is sincere in his resolve to pray, but has an excuse, he will earn the reward in full, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Actions are (recompensed) by intentions, and every person will have but that which he intended.” (Al-Bukhari, 1; Muslim, 1907)\xa0\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) also said to his companions on the way back from the battle of Tabuk: “In Madinah there are men who, whenever you cover a distance or cross a valley, they share the reward with you; they have been detained by sickness.” (Muslim, 1911)\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12601/joining-the-jumuah-prayer-during-tashahhud
308325,"Just want to know if the germ-line gene therapy, which is the introduction of new DNA into gamete cells (sperm or egg) or embryo to prevent or treat genetic disorders permissible or not. Also while this is mostly at research level and a lot of research suggests that it can cause harm as well but it can also work towards treating disease. Considering both these scenarios of harm and cure is it permissible to research into it?","['Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with using gene therapy to prevent or treat genetic disorders if it is free of harm or if any harm is minor and may be overlooked in comparison to the interest that is served and the expected benefits.\nThere is nothing wrong with researching and studying that, and striving to develop it in order to get rid of harmful side effects.\nIn a symposium of the Islamic Organisation for Medical Sciences in Kuwait, on the topic of “Heredity, Genetic Engineering, the Human Genome and Gene Therapy: an Islamic Perspective,” held in partnership with the Islamic Fiqh Council in Jeddah, the regional office of the World Health Organisation in Alexandria, and the Islamic World Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (ISESCO), 23-25 Jumada al-Akhirah 1419 AH/13-15 October 1998 CE, in which a number of senior jurists, doctors, pharmacists, specialists in biological sciences and scholars in other human sciences, the recommendations made by the symposium included the following:\nThirdly: genetic engineering:\nThe symposium studied the topic of genetic engineering and the fears and concerns that have surrounded it since its inception in the 1970s, if it is implemented without guidelines, because it is a two-edged sword that may be used for good or ill.\nThe symposium determined that it is permissible to use it to prevent, treat or alleviate disease, whether it is gene surgery which replaces one gene with another, or inserts the gene into the patient’s cells, or inserts a gene into another living being so as to obtain a large quantity of the secretions of that gene for use as treatment for some diseases.\nAt the same time, the use of genetic engineering on reproductive cells should be prevented, because of the shar‘i reservations concerning that.\nThe symposium affirms the necessity of governments providing such services to those of their citizens who need them but have limited income, because of the high costs involved in producing them.\nThe symposium thinks that it is not permissible to use genetic engineering for evil purposes or to cross the genetic border between different species with the aim of creating hybrid beings for the purpose of entertainment or scientific curiosity.\nThe symposium also thinks that it is not permissible to use genetic engineering as a routine practice for the purpose of changing the genetic structure, in what is known as eugenics (aiming to improve the genetic quality of a human population). Any attempt to tamper with genes in order to change a person’s character or interfere with his fitness to be responsible for his actions is prohibited according to Islamic teachings.\nThe symposium does not see anything wrong, from an Islamic perspective, with using genetic engineering in the fields of agriculture and animal husbandry.\nBut the symposium does not ignore the voices which have recently warned against the possibility of long-term harm that could affect humans, animals, crops or the environment.\nThe symposium thinks that companies and factories which produce food products of animal or plant origin should disclose to the public which of their products are prepared using genetic engineering, so that people will know what they are buying. The symposium also recommends complete awareness in monitoring the results of consuming such products and following the advice and statements of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) regarding this matter.""(Majallat Majma‘ al-Fiqh al-Islami, issue no. 11, Vol. 3, p. 533).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/308325/ruling-on-using-gene-therapy-to-prevent-or-treat-genetic-disorders
2148,"What is the ruling on giving medication in Islam, especially in cases of diseases where there is no hope of a cure? Is it necessary to obtain the patient’s permission before giving treatment, particularly in emergency situations?","['Praise be to Allah.Is it permissible to seek medication?\nThe governing principle is that it is allowed to seek medication because of what has been narrated to this effect in the Quran and Sunnah, i.e., the words and deeds of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and because it involves saving lives, which is one of the overall aims of Shari`ah.\nThe rulings governing the issue of seeking medication differ according to the circumstances and people involved:\n\nSeeking medication is obligatory in cases where not giving medication could cause death, disability or the loss of a limb, or where the sickness is bound to spread if not treated, as in contagious diseases.\nIt is encouraged in cases where not giving medication may weaken a person physically, and it is not as bad as the cases mentioned above.\nIt is allowed in cases which are not covered in the two preceding categories.\nIt is discouraged in cases where the treatment could lead to complications that are worse than the original complaint.\n\nTreatment of cases where recovery is hopeless\xa0\n\nThe Muslim believes that disease and cure are matters that are under the control of Allah, may He be glorified. Treatment and medication are ways of utilizing the laws of cause and effect that Allah has incorporated into the running of the universe.\xa0 It is not permitted to despair of the mercy of Allah – there should always be the hope of healing by the permission of Allah.\xa0 The doctors and families should try to raise the morale of those who are sick and continue their efforts to relieve the mental and physical suffering of the patient regardless of whether a cure is expected or not.\nDeeming a situation to be hopeless is based only on doctors’ opinions, the state of medical science in any given time or place, and the circumstances of the patient himself.\n\nShould we seek the patient’s permission to give him medication?\n\nSeeking the patient’s permission depends on whether he is qualified to give it (i.e., he should be of sound mind, mature, and responsible). If this is not the case, then the permission of his guardian should be sought, within the limits set by Shari`ah which requires the guardian to take care of a person’s interests and protect him from harm. No attention should be paid to the guardian’s refusal to give permission if this is obviously going to harm the person. In this case, guardianship has to be transferred to another guardian, or to the Muslim leader.\nThe Muslim leader has the right to force medication in certain situations, such as a case of contagious disease, or the giving of vaccines or when taking preventive measures to control the spread of diseases.\nIn an emergency where lives are at stake, treatment can be administered without waiting for permission or consent.\nWhen carrying out medical research, there must be total agreement on the part of suitably qualified subjects, with no element of compulsion (such as using prisoners for research) or financial compulsion (such as using the poor), and no harm must result from this research.\xa0 It is not permitted to carry out medical research on people who are unable to give their consent, even if their guardians agree to it.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2148/is-it-permissible-to-seek-medication
