470374,"If I see someone promoting a product and offering it to people for a particular price, and I say that the product in such and such a place is cheaper, will I be regarded as depriving that person of income (rizq)?","['Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with telling people about someone who is selling an item for a cheaper price than someone who is promoting it for a higher price, unless you become certain that the one who is promoting the product has already made a sale or someone has negotiated a price with him and they have already agreed on a particular price. In that case, it is not permissible to tell those people about it, because it is prohibited for a man to undersell his brother, as mentioned in the report narrated by al-Bukhari (2139) and Muslim (1412) from ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not undercut [or outbid] one another.”\nMuslim (1408) narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “No man should propose marriage when his brother has already proposed, or undercut [or outbid] his brother.”\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: With regard to undercutting his brother, an example of that is saying to someone who bought an item, during the period when he still has the option of cancelling the deal: Cancel this deal, and I will sell you something similar for a lower price than his, or of a higher quality for the same price, and the like. This is haram. It is also haram to outbid one’s brother, which means saying to the seller during the period when he still has the option of cancelling the deal: Cancel this deal, and I will buy it from you for a higher price than this, and the like.\nWith regard to outbidding one’s brother, this refers to when the owner of the item and the would-be purchaser have agreed on a price but have not yet finalised the deal, then someone else says to the seller: I will buy it from you. This is haram after the price has been agreed on.""(Sharh Muslim\xa010/158).\nIt says in Sharh Muntaha al-Iradat (2/23): Outbidding a fellow Muslim when he and the seller have agreed on a price is clearly haram, because of the marfu‘ hadith of Abu Hurayrah, “No man should outbid his brother.” Narrated by Muslim. But if there is no clear agreement, it is not haram, because the Muslims always buy and sell in their markets by offering more for certain goods [or selling them for less].\nWhat appears to be the case – and Allah knows best – is that the prohibition on that includes what is mentioned in the question about the item being offered for a lower price elsewhere, because that will cause annoyance to the seller, if he sees that someone is damaging his business. He may interpret that as something intentional that is aimed at harming him, in addition to what may result from that of causing disputes and troubles between the two parties to the transaction.\nAl-Lakhmi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Prohibiting that is a measure to prevent rancour and what it may lead to of mutual resentment.""(Al-Tabsirah\xa0 9/4275).\nIbn Naji (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The reason for the prohibition on proposing to a woman when someone else has already proposed to her is that that could lead to enmity. This reason is also applicable when one person outbids or undercuts another. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said in the rest of the hadith “and he should not outbid [or undercut] his brother.” According to the scholars, this prohibition applies if the two parties have reached an agreement or come close to an agreement.""(Sharh ar-Risalah\xa0 3/961).\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Seeking to hire or rent something after one’s brother has already agreed to hire or rent it, or seeking to borrow something after one’s brother has reached an agreement to borrow something from the same person, or asking for gifts after one’s brother has reached an agreement to receive gifts from the same person, are all like outbidding one’s brother or seeking to buy something that the owner has already decided to give to one’s brother as a gift, or seeking to buy it after the owner has already decided to give it in charity to someone else, and so on, when the ownership of the item will change.End quote; narrated by al-Mirdawi in al-Insaf (11/183).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The teachings of Islam prohibit everything that will lead to dispute, enmity and rancour. “No man should outbid [or undercut] his brother”; “No man should propose marriage when his brother has already proposed”; no man should rent or hire something when there is already an agreement for someone else to rent or hire it; no man should outbid or undercut his brother. Anything that will lead to enmity or rancour is not allowed at all according to Islamic teachings.""(Fath Dhi’l-Jalali wa’l-Ikram\xa0 4/219).\nAs for telling someone who has not actually purchased the item from the one who is promoting it and has not shown any interest in the item or given any indication that he wants to buy it, there is nothing wrong with showing him one’s own product or telling him of a place that is selling it for a cheaper price, because the basic principle is that things are permissible, and that cannot change on the basis of possibility. This does not come under the heading of depriving someone of income (rizq); rather it is showing kindness to people and benefitting them.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/470374/is-it-permissible-to-tell-people-about-a-cheaper-source-than-someone-who-is-promoting-a-product-at-a-particular-price
20081,"""...When half o a third of the night passes by, Allah descends to the lowest heaven and says: 'No one asks more about my servants than myself. Who is asking me, so I can give to him? Who is calling upon me, so I can answer him? who is seeking my forgiveness, so I can forgive him?'"". I got two questions about this hadith.
How saheeh ( or correct ) is this hadith.
And second, what meaning is this hadith?","['Praise be to Allah.Degree of the Hadith about the descent of Allah to the lowest heaven\nThis Hadith is authentic and it\xa0 is proven in the soundest two books after the Book of Allah. It was narrated by Al-Bukhari in his Sahih (1145) and by Muslim (1261) from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The Lord descends every night to the lowest heaven when one-third of the night remains and says: ‘Who will call upon Me, that I may answer Him? Who will ask of Me, that I may give him? Who will seek My forgiveness, that I may forgive him?’”\xa0\nThis Hadith was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) by approximately twenty-eight of the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) and the Ahl Al-Sunnah unanimously agreed that it is to be accepted.\xa0\nMeaning of the descent of Allah to the lowest heaven\nIt should be noted that the descent of the Lord – may He be Exalted – to the lowest heaven is one of the actions that are attributed to Him and has to do with His will and wisdom. It is descending in a real sense, in a manner that befits His Majesty and Might. Allah descends however He wills, whenever He wills. Glory be to Him, there is nothing like unto Him and He is the All-Hearing, All-Seeing.\xa0\nRefuting allegations about the meaning of descending\nIt is not permissible to distort the meaning of the Hadith by saying that what is meant is that His command or mercy descends, or that one of His angels descends. This is false for several reasons:\xa0\n\nThis misinterpretation goes against the apparent meaning of the Hadith. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) attributed descent or the act of descending to Allah, and the basic principle is that a thing is attributed to the one who does it, so if it is attributed to someone else, that is a distortion that goes against this basic principle.\xa0\n\nWe know that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the most knowledgeable of all people about Allah, and that he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the most eloquent of mankind and the most truthful in what he says. There are no lies in his speech and it is impossible for him to attribute something to Allah that is not one of His names or attributes or actions or rulings. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And if he (Muhammad) had forged a false saying concerning Us (Allah), We surely would have seized him by his right hand (or with power and might), And then We certainly would have cut off his life artery (aorta).” [Al-Haqqah 69:44-46]\xa0\nMoreover the only intention of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was to guide mankind, so if he said, “Our Lord descends” and someone else says something that runs contrary to the apparent meaning of these words, such as saying that His command descends, then we say: Do you have more knowledge about Allah than the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)? The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Our Lord descends” but you say His command descends. Or are you more sincere towards the ummah than he was, since he (allegedly) concealed what he was supposed to tell them and told them something different. Undoubtedly the person who tells the people one thing but means something else is not sincere towards them. Or do you think that you are more eloquent than the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)?! Undoubtedly such a misinterpretation implies that one is accusing the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) of some kind of shortcoming that a Muslim can never accept on the part of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). \xa0\n\nThe descent of His command and mercy is not restricted to this part of the night, rather His command and mercy descend all the time. If it is said that what is meant is a specific command or specific mercy which does not happen all the time, the answer to that is that if we assume that this interpretation is correct, then the Hadith indicates that where the descent of this thing ends is in the lowest heaven, so what benefit can it be to us if mercy descend to the lowest heaven without reaching us? Why would the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) even tell us about it?\nThe Hadith indicates that the One Who descends says: “Who will call upon Me, that I may answer Him? Who will ask of Me, that I may give him? Who will seek My forgiveness, that I may forgive him?” No one can say that except Allah, may He be Exalted.
