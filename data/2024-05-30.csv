503975,"What is the ruling on what some people do, whereby they give in charity the costs of doing ‘umrah to someone who wants to do ‘umrah, with the intention of that being an ongoing charity (sadaqah jariyah) on behalf of someone who has died? Meaning that the reward of the charity will go to the deceased, and it will allow the pilgrim to do ‘umrah if he intends to do that ‘umrah on behalf of himself?","['Praise be to Allah.We have previously stated that it is permissible to give money to one in need so that he can do ‘umrah or Hajj. Please see the answer to question no. 346822.\nGiving money to someone so that he can do ‘umrah with it is an act of kindness, so it is an act of charity.\nMuslim (1005) narrated from Hudhayfah that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Every good deed is a charity.”\nIt says in al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah al-Kuwaitiyyah (26/323):\nIn linguistic terms, sadaqah (charity) refers to what is given for the purpose of drawing closer to Allah, may He be exalted, not for the purpose of showing kindness to someone …\nIn Islamic terminology, it means giving something during one’s lifetime for nothing in return, for the purpose of drawing close to Allah, may He be exalted…\nAl-Hattab said: If a gift (hibah) is given purely for the purpose of seeking reward in the hereafter, then it is charity (sadaqah). Something similar was stated by al-Ba‘li al-Hanbali in al-Mutli‘ ‘ala Abwab al-Muqni‘. End quote.\nGiving charity on behalf of one who has died is prescribed according to scholarly consensus, and there is the hope that the reward will reach both the giver and the deceased person on whose behalf he gave charity.\nShaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nGiving charity on behalf of one who has died is prescribed, and will benefit the deceased. It is soundly narrated in as-Sahihayn from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that he was asked about that. A man said to him: O Messenger of Allah, my mother has died; will she have reward if I give charity on her behalf? He said: “Yes.” Thus charity will benefit the deceased, and there is the hope that the giver will have a reward similar to that which reaches the deceased, because he has done a good deed voluntarily, so there is the hope that he will have a reward like what he gave…""(Fatawa Nur ‘ala ad-Darb\xa0 14/312).\nFor more information, please see the answers to questions no. 42384 and 219751 .\nConclusion:\nIt is prescribed for the Muslim to donate money to a needy person so that he can do ‘umrah, and to dedicate the reward for that money to a Muslim who has died.\nBut we should point out that this charity is not ongoing charity (sadaqah jariyah); rather it is charity that will come to an end. Ongoing charity refers to a waqf (Islamic endowment) that is not used up or consumed, and is not spent; rather it is wealth that is put into a permanent asset that can be used and reused, such as if wealth is used to build a mosque or donate books of knowledge as a waqf, and the like.\nHelping a pilgrim to do Hajj or ‘umrah by giving him money is an act of charity on behalf of the deceased, and will help him in sha Allah, but it is not ongoing charity (sadaqah jariyah).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/503975/what-is-the-ruling-on-giving-in-charity-on-behalf-of-one-who-has-died-the-costs-of-doing-umrah
22203,"Could u please tell us relating the 'Day of judgement' it's tortures,the questions that wud be asked.","['Praise be to Allah.Questions on the grave\nIt is proven in the Quran and Sunnah that when a person dies, he will be called to account for every major and minor action he did in this world, whether it was good or bad. He will be rewarded for his good deeds and punished for his bad deeds.\xa0\nThe first stage of that reckoning is in the grave . In the grave, the first thing a person will be asked will be: Who was your Lord? What is your religion? Who is this man who was sent amongst you? – as was narrated in the Hadith of Al-Bara’ ibn `Azib (may Allah be pleased with him), which was narrated by Abu Dawud in his Sunan (4753) and classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud, 2979.\xa0\nWhat questions will be asked on the Day of Judgement?\nThen on the Day of Resurrection he will be brought to account for every major and minor action , even though he has already been brought to account for that in the grave . The first thing for which he will be brought to account for then will be his prayer.\xa0\nIt was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The first thing among their deeds for which the people will be brought to account on the Day of Resurrection will be prayer. Our Lord will say to His angels, although He knows best, `Look at My slave’s prayer, is it complete or lacking?’ If it is complete, it will be recorded as complete, but if it is lacking, He will say, `Look and see whether my slave did any optional prayers.’ If he had done voluntary prayers, He will say, `Complete the obligatory prayers of My slave from his voluntary prayers.’ Then the rest of his deeds will be examined in a similar manner.”\xa0((Narrated by Abu Dawud, 864; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud, 770)\nOn the Day of Resurrection, people will be asked about other matters, including the following:\xa0\n\nIt was narrated from Ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The son of Adam will not be dismissed from before his Lord on the Day of Resurrection until he has been questioned about five things: his life and how he spent it, his youth and how he used it, his wealth and how he earned it and how he disposed of it, and how he acted upon what he acquired of knowledge.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 2422; classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Tirmidhi, 1969)\xa0\nAnd the nations will be asked on the Day of Resurrection:\xa0\n\n“What answer gave you to the Messengers?” [Al-Qasas 28:65 – interpretation of the meaning]\nThese are some of the things about which people will be asked on the Day of Resurrection. So the wise person who is keen to save himself should prepare answers to these questions.

315882,"By Allah’s leave, I intend to do Hajj. Is it permissible for me to wear a face mask instead of niqab, because my eyesight is weak and I want to be able to see clearly?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe woman in ihram is not allowed to wear anything that is tailored to fit her face, such as the niqab, burqa‘ and litham [types of face veils], because of the report narrated by al-Bukhari (1838) from ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: A man stood up and said: O Messenger of Allah, what garments do you instruct us to wear in ihram?\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not wear a chemise, or trousers, or a turban, or a burnoose, except for one who does not have sandals, in which case he may wear khuffs (leather slippers that come above the ankle), but let him cut them so that they come lower than the ankles. And do not wear anything that has been dyed with saffron or safflower, and the woman in ihram should not wear a niqab or gloves.”\nThe jurists disallowed wearing a burqa‘, and some of them disallowed wearing a litham, because they are face veils (niqab) or come under the same ruling as face veils.\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: … The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “A woman should not wear a niqab or gloves” meaning in ihram. So her hands and face are equal with regard to the prohibition on wearing what has been made to fit the shape of any part of the body.\nThe correct view is that anything that comes under the general meaning of the wording of the hadith and the same reason for prohibition is also prohibited. Although the burqa‘ and litham are not called niqab, there is no difference between them and niqab. Rather if the niqab is prohibited [in ihram], then it is more appropriate that the burqa‘ and litham should also be prohibited.""(I‘lam al-Muwaqqi‘in\xa0 2/393-395).\nIt says in Kifayat al-Talib ar-Rabbani (1/554): She may cover all of her face and hands with a cloth that she lets down from the top of her head, but she should not use any pins.\nShe should not wear a niqab, burqa‘ or litham; if she does any of that, then she must pay a penalty (fidyah). End quote.\nThe litham is something that is worn over the mouth.\nIt says in al-Misbah al-Munir (2/549): The litham is something that covers the lips.\nAnd it says (2/556, under the root la fa ma): The verb talaffama refers to taking the end of the turban and putting it over the mouth, like a niqab, except that it does not reach the bridge or tip of the nose.\nIf it covers part of the nose, then it is called a niqab. This was stated by Abu Zayd.\nAl-Asma‘i said: If the niqab covers the mouth [only], then it is a lifam or litham. End quote.\nBased on that, the face mask is a niqab, so it is more appropriate that it should be prohibited than the litham.\nThe only difference is that the face mask does not cover the entire face; rather it covers part of it, but it is tailored to cover that part of the face.\nIt says in al-Insaf (3/466): Tailored clothes include that which is tailored to fit the shape of the body part in question. This is according to scholarly consensus.\xa0\nA number of scholars said that it refers to that which is tailored to fit the shape and is intended to do so.\nAl-Qadi and others said: Even if something is worn in a manner other than what is usual, such as wearing socks on the hand or a khuff on the head, the penalty (fidyah) is still due. End quote.\nSo wearing a face mask is not permissible for a woman [in ihram], just as a niqab is not permissible.\nBut if she needs to wear it because of sickness, or because of foul smells, then it is permissible for her to wear it, but she must pay the penalty [fidyah] for doing something that is ordinarily prohibited in ihram because of an ailment.\nShaykh Zakariya al-Ansari (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Asna al-Matalib (1/507): If someone wears when in ihram something that is prohibited to wear in ihram, or if he covers something that is prohibited to cover when in ihram, because he needs to do that due to extreme heat or cold, or for the purpose of medical treatment and the like, it is permissible, but he must pay the penalty (fidyah). End quote.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThere are three scenarios for doing actions that are prohibited when in ihram:\ni. The first scenario is when he does the prohibited action for no essential reason and with no excuse. In this case, he is sinning and must pay the penalty (fidyah).\nii. The second scenario is when he does it for an essential reason. In this case, he is not sinning but he must pay the penalty (fidyah).\nIf he needs to cover his head because of cold or heat from which he fears harm, it is permissible for him to cover it, but he must pay the penalty (fidyah).\niii. The third scenario is when he does it but is excused because he was unaware of the ruling, or he forgot, or he was forced to do it, or he fell asleep. In this case, he is not sinning and he does not have to pay the penalty (fidyah).""(Majmu‘ Fatawa wa Rasa’il al-Uthaymin\xa024/433).\nThe penalty (fidyah) is: to fast for three days; or to feed six poor persons, giving each one half a sa‘ of foodstuff; or to sacrifice a sheep. The pilgrim in ihram may choose any one of these three options.\nAs for a man, there is nothing wrong with him wearing a face mask, because it is not prohibited for him to cover his face [when in ihram], according to the more correct scholarly view. Please see the answer to question no. 106560 .\nSecondly:\nThe woman in ihram should cover her face in front of non-mahram men with something that she lets down from the top of her head over her face.\nIbn Qudamah said: Ibn al-Mundhir said: The view that the burqa‘ is makruh (disliked – when a woman is in ihram) is soundly narrated from Sa‘d, Ibn ‘Umar, Ibn ‘Abbas, and ‘A’ishah, and we do not know of anyone who disagreed with that. Al-Bukhari and others narrated that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “and the woman [in ihram] should not wear a niqab or gloves.”\nBut if she needs to cover her face when men pass by near her, then she should let down the cloth from the top of her head over her face.\nThat was narrated from ‘Uthman and ‘A’ishah, and it was the view of ‘Ata, Malik, ath-Thawri, ash-Shafa‘i, Ishaq and Muhammad ibn al-Hasan, and we do not know of any difference of opinion regarding that. That is because of the report narrated from ‘A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), who said: The riders used to pass by us when we were in ihram with the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). When they came alongside us, one of us would let down her jilbab from her head over her face, then when they had passed us, we would uncover our faces. Narrated by Abu Dawud and al-Athram. Al-Mughni (3/154).\nThe hadith of ‘A’ishah was classed as sahih by al-Albani in Risalat Jilbab al-Mar’ah.\nYou can make this jilbab of light material that you can see through without any difficulty.\nIf that is too difficult for you, then there is nothing wrong with you wearing niqab and paying the penalty (fidyah); that will be better than wearing a face mask which does not cover the entire face.\nAnd Allah knows best']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/315882/ruling-on-a-woman-in-ihram-wearing-a-face-mask
130871,What is the reason for doing Wudu after eating camel meat?,"['Praise be to Allah.Does Eating Camel Meat Break Your Wudu?\nIt is proven that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) enjoined doing Wudu after eating camel meat , but he did not explain the reason why. We know that Allah, may He be glorified, is Most Wise and All Knowing, and He does not prescribe anything for His slaves except that which is good and is in their best interests in this world and the Hereafter, and He does not forbid to them anything but that which is harmful for them in this world and the Hereafter.\xa0\nWhat the Muslim should do is accept the commands of Allah, may He be glorified, and His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and act upon them, even if he does not know the exact reason behind them. Similarly, he has to refrain from that which Allah and His Messenger have forbidden, even if he does not know the exact reason behind it, because he is a slave who is commanded to obey Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). He was created to do that, so he has to obey and submit, whilst believing that Allah is Most Wise and All-Knowing. If he finds out the reason behind it, then that is good upon good.\xa0(Majmu` Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 10/157)\xa0\nWhy do you have to do Wudu after eating camel meat?\nSome of the scholars are of the view that this ruling is the matter of worship and the reason for it is not known.\xa0\nAl-Mardawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The correct view is that doing Wudu after eating camel meat is an act of worship; this is the view of our companions … And it was said that there is a reason for it.” (Al-Insaf, 1/355)\xa0\nThe scholars who said that there is a reason for it mentioned a number of reasons, including the following:\xa0\n\nThe camel has a devilish nature, so whoever eats its meat will develop some devilish energy as a result ; so it is prescribed to do Wudu so as to take away that energy.\n\nIt was narrated that Al-Bara’ ibn `Azib (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was asked about praying in camel pens. He said: “Do not pray in camel pens, for they are of the devils.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 493; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Al-Irwa’, 176)\xa0\nAccording to a version narrated by Ibn Majah (769): “…for they were created from the devils.”\xa0\nIt was narrated that Hamzah ibn `Amr Al-Aslami (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “On the back of every camel there is a devil, so when you ride them, mention the name of Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted…” (Narrated by Ahmad, 2667; classed as sound by Al-Albani in As-Silsilah As-Sahihah, 2271)\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) indicated that camels are of the devils, meaning – and Allah knows best – that they are of the type of the devils, because every stubborn, rebellious creature is a devil, no matter what animal it is. So the black dog is a devil, and camels are the devils of the An`am animals (a category that includes camels, cattle and sheep), and there are also devils among mankind… So if a person eats camel meat that may make him hostile and wild, and cause him to acquire some characteristics like those of devils. The devil was created from fire, and fire is only extinguished by water, so man is enjoined to do Wudu after eating its meat so as to stop that devilish energy and suppress it. That is because the heart and attitude of man is changed by the food that he eats.” (Sharh `Umdat Al-Faqih, 1/185)\xa0\nHe also said:\n“If a person does Wudu after eating camel meat, that will extinguish the devilish energy and will put an end to any negative consequences, unlike the one who does not do Wudu after eating it, and he will see negative consequences. Hence it is said that because the Bedouin eat camel meat without doing Wudu after eating it, grudges developed among them.” (Majmu` Al-Fatawah, 20/523)\xa0\nSimilar comments were made by Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) in I`lam Al-Muwaqqi`in `an Rabb il-`Alamin, 2/40)\n\nCamel meat has a strong impact on the nerves and provokes them. Hence modern medicine tells the hot-tempered individual not to eat a great deal of camel meat. Doing Wudu soothes and calms the nerves. By the same token, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed us to do Wudu at times of anger, so as to calm down. (Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti`, 1/308)\xa0\n\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Whether this is the reason behind it or not, the reason is that it is the command of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), but if we find out the wisdom behind it, that is a blessing from Allah and an increase in knowledge; if we do not know it, then we have to accept and submit.”\xa0\nFor more details, please refer to the following answers: 36736 , 85534 , 10498 , and 20330 .\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/130871/why-do-you-have-to-do-wudu-after-eating-camel-meat
