289281,"Is the verse {for the male, what is equal to the share of two females} [An-Nisa’ 4:11], applicable only to the shares of inheritance, or does it apply to all other issues? For example, when a father gives pocket money to his children, should he give the boys ten and the girls five? Is that permissible, noting that the girls are older?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Allah instructs you concerning your children: for the male, what is equal to the share of two females}\xa0[An-Nisa’ 4:11].\nThis verse has to do with the division of the estate. In the event of the father’s death, what he leaves behind is to be divided amongst his children in this manner.\nSecondly:\nWith regard to what a father gives to his children when he is still alive, it is of two types:\nThe first type:\nis what he gives them by way of maintenance, which the father is obliged to provide for his children. This is to be done according to need. A daughter may need more than a son, or vice versa, according to the need of each of them.\nIt says in al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah al-Kuwaitiyyah (41/81):\nThe jurists are unanimously agreed that what is required with regard to the maintenance of relatives is what is sufficient of bread, condiments, clothing, shelter and breastfeeding, for an infant, because there is a need for these things, and they are to be estimated according to what meets the need. End quote.\nBased on that, if the children’s needs are equal, then the father must give equally to males and females. If their needs are different, then he must give each of them as much as will meet their needs.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThere is another type of need which applies equally to all the children, namely the case of gifts, maintenance or arranging marriages. Undoubtedly, in that case, it is haram to differentiate between them.""(Al-Fatawa al-Kubra\xa0 5/435).\nOne example of that is what a father gives to his children – as mentioned in the question – of pocket money. This comes under the heading of maintenance, so the share of the male does not have to be the share of two females; rather the father should look at what each of his children needs, and give him what will suffice him, taking into account the child’s age and gender, because in this regard, one who is younger is not like one who is older, and one who is male is not like one who is female. The father should strive to be equitable in that regard. He may think that being equitable means giving each child, male or female, the same, if they are close in age.\nThe second type:\nis what the father gives to his children by way of showing kindness, without it being based on the need that calls for that. This refers to gift giving, in which Islam teaches parents to treat their children equitably. So it is not permissible to give to one child and not to another, because of the hadith of an-Nu‘man ibn Bashir (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: My father gave me a gift, but [my mother] ‘Amrah bint Rawahah said: I will not approve until you ask the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to bear witness. So my father went to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and said: I have given a gift to my son from ‘Amrah bint Rawahah, but she told me to ask you to bear witness, O Messenger of Allah. He said: “Have you given a similar gift to all your children?”\nHe said: No.\nHe said: “Fear Allah and treat your children fairly.” So he came back and took back his gift.\nNarrated by al-Bukhari (2587) and Muslim (1623).\nAccording to a report narrated by Abu Dawud (3544) from an-Nu‘man ibn Bashir, he said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Treat your children fairly, treat your children fairly.”\nThe scholars differed as to how the father should treat his children fairly in this case. Does fairness mean giving the same to males and females, or does it mean giving according to the division of the shares of inheritance, with the male receiving the share of two females?\nMuhammad ibn al-Hasan, the companion of Abu Hanifah, and a number of the Malikis, Shafa‘is and Hanbalis – according to their famous view – were of the view that fairness means giving in accordance with the shares of inheritance, with the male receiving the share of two females.\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThen they differed as to what is meant by giving equally. Muhammad ibn al-Hasan, Ahmad, Ishaq and some of the Shafa‘is and Malikis said: Fairness means giving the male two shares, like the shares of inheritance. They quoted as evidence the fact that this is what the female’s share of that wealth would be if the giver left it behind when he died.""(Fath al-Bari\xa0 5/214).\nSome scholars are of the view that fairness means giving equal shares. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nChildren should be given according to what Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, said in His Book about inheritance: {for the male, what is equal to the share of two females} [An-Nisa’ 4:11]. Undoubtedly nothing is more fair than the way in which Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, divided the shares of inheritance. Whoever says that there is a difference between when the parent is alive and when he is dead must provide evidence for that. Hence we say: in life and after death, it is the same.""(Ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘\xa0 11/80).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/289281/giving-the-son-the-share-of-two-daughters-is-that-only-applicable-to-the-shares-of-inheritance
258503,"What is the evidence for following the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in his actions, especially since there is a difference of opinion concerning the principle that what matters is the general meaning (not the specific reason for a particular teaching)?","['Praise be to Allah.Types of Actions of Prophet Muhammad\nThe actions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) are of different types. Some of them are prescriptive (meaning that they set an example to be followed and are part of the teachings of Islam); some of them are things that he did because he was a human being (and these things are dictated by human nature), such as eating and sleeping; and some of them are things that may be understood either as being prescriptive or being because he was human, such as his going for Hajj riding, or his lying down after the Sunnah prayer of Fajr.\nWith regard to the actions that were purely prescriptive – such as his prayer, fasting, Hajj and Adhkar – and things that he encouraged his Ummah to do in conjunction with some acts of worship – such as using the Siwak, mentioning the name of Allah when starting to eat, entering the mosque with the right foot first, and so on – the basic principle is that we are to follow him in them, because Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“There has certainly been for you in the Messenger of Allah an excellent pattern for anyone whose hope is in Allah and the Last Day and [who] remembers Allah often.” [Al-Ahzab 33:21]\n“Say, [O Muhammad], `If you should love Allah , then follow me, [so] Allah will love you and forgive you your sins. And Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.’” [Al `Imran 3:31]\n“And whatever the Messenger has given you – take.” [Al-Hashr 59:7]\nWith regard to natural human actions, such as eating, drinking, sleeping, walking and so on, we are not required to follow his example in that regard.\nWith regard to actions that could be either prescriptive or human, there is a difference of scholarly opinion concerning them.\nIt says in Maraqi As-Su`ud [in verse]:\nThe actions he [the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)] did as a human, such as eating and drinking, are not prescriptive,\nwhen there is no description of how to do these human actions, in which case they could be prescriptive, and there is some scholarly discussion about that.\nSo doing Hajj riding is part of that, as is lying down after Fajr.\n“when there is no description of how to do these human actions” means: eating, in principle, is a human action, but eating with the right hand, eating from what is closest to you and mentioning the name of Allah before starting to eat are matters in which it is prescribed to follow his example.\nShaykh Al-Amin Ash-Shinqiti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“As to whether the actions of the Prophet are human or prescriptive, his actions fall into three categories:\n\nThe first category is actions that are purely human, by which I mean actions that are dictated by human nature, such as standing, sitting, eating and drinking. These actions were not done to prescribe or set an example to be followed. No one says: “I am sitting or standing as a way of drawing closer to Allah and following the example of His Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) because he used to stand and sit”, because he did not do that for the purpose of prescribing or setting an example to be followed. Some of the scholars said that his human actions indicate that those actions are permissible, and others said that it indicates that they are recommended.\n\nWhat appears to be the correct view is what we have mentioned, which is that he did not do those things for the purpose of prescribing, but they indicate that those actions are permissible.\n\nThe second category is actions that are purely for the purpose of prescription (and form part of the teachings of Islam). These are actions that he did for the purpose of setting an example to be followed and prescribing those actions, such as the actions of the prayer and the actions of Hajj, in addition to which he said: “Pray as you have seen me praying” and “Learn from me your rituals of Hajj.”\nThe third category is what is referred to here, namely actions that could be interpreted as being simply human or as being for the purpose of prescribing.\n\nThe guideline here is that human nature inherently dictates these actions, but they are connected to an act of worship, in the sense that they happen within the act of worship or are means of doing that act of worship, such as riding to perform Hajj. The Prophet’s riding to perform Hajj may be interpreted as being due to being human, because being human dictates that one must ride (to cover great distances), as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) rode in all his journeys, without that riding being done as an act of worship; rather it was because being human dictated that. Or it may be interpreted as being a prescriptive action, because he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did that in conjunction with performing Hajj, and he said: “Learn from me your rituals of Hajj.”\nMinor issues connected to this matter include: Jalsat Al-Istirahah in prayer [a brief sitting after two prostrations in any Rak`ah where there is no Tashahhud]; returning from the `Eid prayer via a route different from the route one took to get to the prayer; lying on one’s right side between the Sunnah prayer of Fajr and the obligatory Fajr prayer; entering Makkah from Kada’ and leaving from Kuda; halting in Al-Muhassab after leaving Mina, and so on.\nConcerning all these issues there is a difference of opinion among the scholars, because of the possibility that they may be either due to being human or they may be prescriptive actions .” ( Adwa’ Al-Bayan (4/300)\nAll rulings apply to the Prophet as well as his ummah\nThe basic principle is that all rulings apply to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) as well as his Ummah, except when there is evidence to indicate that a ruling applies specifically to him. Hence the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) used to follow his example in everything that he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did, and they did not ask whether this action was exclusively for him or not. For example, in the Hadith of Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him), we see that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) took off his shoes [during the prayer], and the people also took off their shoes. When he finished the prayer, he said: “Why did you take off your shoes?” They said: O Messenger of Allah, we saw you take off your shoes, so we took off our shoes. He (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Jibril came to me and told me that there was some filth on them. When one of you enters the mosque, let him turn up his shoes and look at them; if he sees some filth on them, let him wipe it on the ground, then pray wearing them.” (Narrated by Ahmad, 17/242, 243; classed as authentic by the commentators on Al-Musnad)\nIn fact, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) got angry with some of his companions when they interpreted something that he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did as being exclusively for him.\nIt was narrated from `Aishah, the wife of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), that a man said to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): O Messenger of Allah, (sometimes) I wake up Junub (in a state of impurity due to sexual activity or a wet dream), and want to fast. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “(Sometimes) I also wake up Junub and want to fast, so I do ghusl and fast.” The man said: O Messenger of Allah, you are not like us! Allah has forgiven you your past and future sins. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “By Allah, I hope that I am the most fearing of Allah and the most knowledgeable of you all in what I follow.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 2389; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud)\nIbn Hazm (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “It is not permissible to say concerning anything that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did that it was exclusive to him unless there is a text to that effect, because he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) got angry with the one who said that, and whatever angered the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is prohibited.” (Al-Ihkam fi Usul Al-Ahkam (4/433)\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The basic principle is that the rulings that applied to his Ummah also applied to him, except where the evidence indicates that something applied only to him . Hence Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) said to him [at Al-Hudaybiyyah]: Go out and do not speak to anyone until you have shaved your head and offered your sacrifice – because she knew that the people would follow his lead.” (Zad Al-Ma`ad)\nIf it was not an action dictated by being human, then the Prophetic action is an example to be followed\nEverything that was narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is subject to the discussion mentioned above. If it was not an action dictated by being human, then it is an example to be followed, unless there is evidence to prove that it applied only to him. It makes no difference whether the action was narrated from a group of the Companions who saw him or only one of them saw him (and narrated it).\nThe basic principle is that urination is an inherently human action, but the way in which it is to be done – standing or sitting – is a matter that is addressed by Islamic teachings and has to do with following the example of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), because it is narrated that it is prohibited to urinate whilst standing, and this instruction is prescriptive and must be followed. Then it was proven that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did that whilst standing. So in this case we must see how to reconcile between the reports.\nIbn Majah narrated (309) that Jabir ibn `Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade us to urinate whilst standing. But this Hadith was classed as inauthentic. Al-Busayri (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Az-Zawa’id: The [scholars] unanimously agreed that it is inauthentic. Al-Albani said: “It is very inauthentic.”\nAt-Tirmidhi (12) narrated that `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) saw me urinating whilst standing, and he said: “O `Umar, do not urinate whilst standing.” So I never urinated whilst standing again after that. This Hadith was classed as inauthentic by At-Tirmidhi and Al-Albani.\nAl-Bazzar (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated from Buraydahr (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “It is uncouth for a man to urinate whilst standing.” At-Tirmidhi referred to this Hadith and said that it is not known.\nBased on that, the prohibition on urinating whilst standing is not soundly narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nBut At-Tirmidhi (12) and An-Nasa’i (29) narrated that `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: Whoever tells you that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to urinate whilst standing, do not believe him; he only ever urinated whilst sitting. (Classed as authentic by At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa’i)\nAsh-Shawkani (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Nayl Al-Awtar (1/16): “This Hadith indicates that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not urinate whilst standing; rather it was his practice to sit when he urinating, so urinating whilst standing is disliked.”\nThe fact that it is permissible to urinate whilst standing is indicated by the report narrated by Al-Bukhari (224) and Muslim (273) from Hudhayfah\xa0 (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came to the garbage-dump of some people, and urinated whilst standing, then he called for water. I brought some water to him and he did Wudu’.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“The concession allowing this has been narrated from `Umar, `Ali, Ibn `Umar, Zayd ibn Thabit, Sahl ibn Sa`d, Anas, Abu Hurayrah and `Urwah\xa0 (may Allah be pleased with them).\nHudhayfah\xa0 (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came to the garbage-dump of some people and urinated whilst standing. This was narrated by Al-Bukhari and others.\nPerhaps the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did that in order to highlight that it is permissible, and he only did it once. Or it may be that he was in a place where it was not possible to sit.\nIt was said that he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did that because of a pain in the hollow at the back of his knee (popliteal space).” (Al-Mughni (1/108)\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “It is proven from `Umar, `Ali, Zayd ibn Thabit and others that they urinated whilst standing , which indicates that it is permissible and is not disliked, if there is no risk of it splashing back. And Allah knows best.\nThere is no proven report from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to indicate that it is prohibited. And Allah knows best.” (Fath al-Bari (1/330)\nGet rid of Satanic whispers\nIt is essential to beware of waswasah (intrusive thoughts), for it is a disease and an evil thing.

49039,Is it correct for a sinner to justify his falling into sin by saying that this is what Allah has decreed for him?,"['Praise be to Allah.Belief in Al-Qadar is no excuse for failing to do obligatory duties\xa0\nSome sinners and some who fall short (in religious commitment) make excuses for their shortcomings and sins by saying that Allah is the One Who has decreed this for them, so they should not be blamed for it.\xa0\nWhat they say is not correct under any circumstances. There can be no doubt that belief in Al-Qadar is no excuse for failing to do obligatory duties or committing sins, according to the consensus of the Muslims and all those who are wise.\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“No one has the right to make excuses for sin by referring to Al-Qadar , according to the consensus of the Muslims and the followers of other religions, and all those who are wise. If this were acceptable, then anyone could do whatever crosses his mind of murder, seizing people’s wealth and any kind of spreading mischief in the land, and quote Al-Qadar as his excuse. If a person who quotes Al-Qadar as an excuse were attacked by another person who also quoted Al-Qadar as an excuse for that, he would not accept that, and thus he would contradict himself, which in itself is proof that this logic is false. So using Al-Qadar as an excuse is clearly flawed, as is obvious to anyone who has any common sense.” (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 8/179)\xa0\nShari`ah and common sense indicate that it is invalid to give Al-Qadar as an excuse for committing sin\nBoth the texts of Shari`ah and common sense indicate that it is invalid to give Al-Qadar as an excuse for committing sin or not doing obligatory actions.\xa0\nThe evidence of Shari`ah includes the following:\xa0\n\nThe verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n\n“Those who took partners (in worship) with Allah will say: ‘If Allah had willed, we would not have taken partners (in worship) with Him, nor would our fathers, and we would not have forbidden anything (against His Will).’ Likewise belied those who were before them, (they argued falsely with Allah’s Messengers), till they tasted Our Wrath. Say: ‘Have you any knowledge (proof) that you can produce before us? Verily, you follow nothing but guess and you do nothing but lie’.”\xa0 [Al-An`am 6:148]\xa0\nThese polytheists quoted Al-Qadar as an excuse for their Shirk, but if their excuse had been valid Allah would not have caused them to taste His Wrath. Whoever gives Al-Qadar as an excuse for sin and shameful behaviour might as well justify the ways of the disbelievers and attribute injustice to Allah as well – Exalted be Allah far above that.\xa0\n\nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n\n“Messengers as bearers of good news as well as of warning in order that mankind should have no plea against Allah after the (coming of) Messengers. And Allah is Ever All-Powerful, All-Wise.” [An-Nisa’ 4:165]\xa0\nIf Al-Qadar were an acceptable excuse for committing sin, definitive proof would not have been established by the sending of the Messengers, and indeed there would have been no point in sending the Messengers.\xa0\n\nAllah issues commands and prohibitions to His slaves, but He does not burden them with more than they can bear:\xa0\n\n“So keep your duty to Allah and fear Him as much as you can.” [At-Taghabun 64:16]\xa0\n“Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope.” [Al-Baqarah 2:286]\xa0\nIf a person were forced to do things, he would be obliged to do things over which he had no control and this is not right. Hence whatever wrongs he commits due to ignorance or being compelled to do them, there is no sin on him for that, because he has an excuse. If this excuse (of Al-Qadar) were valid, then there would be no difference between one who is forced to do something, one who is ignorant and one who does it deliberately. But what is in fact known from real life and basic common sense, is that there is a great difference between them.\xa0\n\nAl-Qadar is something secret and concealed which no one in creation knows until it has come to pass. When a person does something, his will precedes his action, so his will to do it is not based on knowledge of the decree of Allah. So his claim that Allah has decreed that he should do such and such is a false claim, because it is a claim to have knowledge of the unseen, but no one knows the unseen except Allah. So this argument is flawed, because no man can base his evidence on something of which he knows nothing.\xa0\nQuoting Al-Qadar as an excuse for sin implies that the laws of Allah are pointless and that the reckoning, resurrection, and reward and punishment will not happen.\xa0\nIf Al-Qadar were a valid excuse for sin, the people of Hell would have used it, when they see the punishment and realise that they are going to fall into it and when the angels start to rebuke them. But in fact they do not use it as an excuse, rather they say – as Allah tells us (interpretation of the meaning) – \xa0\n\n“ ‘Our Lord! Respite us for a little while, we will answer Your Call and follow the Messengers!’” [Ibrahim 14:44]\xa0\n“‘Our Lord! Our wretchedness overcame us.’” [Al-Mu’minun 23:106]\xa0\n“‘Had we but listened or used our intelligence, we would not have been among the dwellers of the blazing Fire!’” [Al-Mulk 67:10]\xa0\n“We were not of those who used to offer the prayers.” [Al-Muddaththir 74:43], etc.\xa0\nIf Al-Qadar were a justifiable excuse for sin, they would use it, for they are in the most desperate need of an excuse that would save them from the Fire of Hell.\xa0\n\nIf Al-Qadar were a valid excuse for sin, it would have been an excuse for satan who said:\xa0\n\n“ ‘Because You have sent me astray, surely, I will sit in wait against them (human beings) on Your straight path’” [Al-A`raf 7:16 – interpretation of the meaning]\xa0\nAnd Pharaoh the enemy of Allah would have been equal with [Prophet] Musa (peace be upon him), the one with whom Allah spoke.\xa0\n\nAnother point that refutes this argument and demonstrates it to be invalid, is the fact that we see how people are keen to get what benefits them in this world. You never see anyone who ignores worldly things that are good for him and doing things that harm him on the grounds that this is what Allah has decreed. Why would anyone turn away from that which will benefit him in spiritual terms and turn to that which will harm him, and then claim that this is what Allah has decreed for him?\xa0\n\nI will give some examples which will clarify that for you: if a person wants to travel to some country, and there are two routes to this country, one of which is safe and secure, and the other is remote and dangerous, with the risk of murder and robbery, which route will he take?\xa0\nUndoubtedly he will take the first route. So why, with regard to the Hereafter, does he not take the road to Paradise and avoid the road to Hell?\xa0\n\nAnother point that may be used to refute the one who quotes Al-Qadar as evidence, is to follow his own line of reasoning and tell him: “Do not get married, and if Allah has decreed that you should have a son, you will have one, otherwise you will never have a child. Do not eat or drink, and if Allah has decreed that you should be satisfied, that will happen, otherwise it will never happen. If a wild animal attacks you, do not run away from it, and if Allah has decreed that you should be saved, then you will be, and if He has not decreed that you will be saved, running away will not help you. If you fall sick, do not seek treatment, and if Allah has decreed that you will recover then you will do so, but if He has not then medicine will never help you.”\xa0\n\nWill he agree with such comments or not? If he agrees with us, then we will know that his reasoning is not sound. If he disagrees with us, we will know that what he says and the excuses he gives are not valid.\xa0\n\nThe one who quotes Al-Qadar as an excuse for sin is likening himself to the insane and minors, who are not accountable and will not be taken to task, but if he were to be treated as they are in this world he would not accept that.\xa0\nIf we accept this excuse, there would be no need to pray for forgiveness, or repent, or make Du`aa’, or strive in Jihad, or enjoin what is good and forbid what is evil.\xa0\nIf Al-Qadar were an excuse for shameful behaviour and sin, then there would be anarchy and chaos. There would be no need for hudud and Ta`zir punishments, or other types of penalties, because the wrongdoer would be able to quote Al-Qadar as an excuse and we would not need to punish wrongdoers and bandits or to have courts and a judiciary system, because everything that happens only by the decree of Allah. But no wise man would say such a thing.\xa0\nThe one who gives Al-Qadar as an excuse says: We will not be taken to task, because Allah has decreed this for us, and how can we be taken to task for something that has been decreed for us?\xa0\n\nWe say to him: We will not be taken to task for that which has already been decreed for us, but we will be taken to task for what we do and earn. We are not commanded to do that which Allah has decreed for us, rather we are commanded to do that which is enjoined upon us. There is a difference between what Allah wills for us and what He wants from us. What He wills for us He has kept secret, but what He wants from us He has commanded us to do.\xa0\nThe fact that Allah knows what we will do from eternity and has written that down is not an excuse, because His all-encompassing knowledge means that He knows what His creation will do, but that does not imply any kind of compulsion. By way of example – and for Allah is the highest description (cf Al-Nahl 16:60) – if a teacher knows that one of his students will not make the grade this year because he is too careless and lazy, then this student fails just as the teacher knew he would, would any wise person say that the teacher forced him to fail, or would the student have any right to say “I did not succeed because this teacher knew that I would never succeed”?!\xa0\nIn conclusion, quoting Al-Qadar as an excuse for committing sin or for not doing obligatory duties is a false excuse, according to Shari`ah, common\xa0 sense and reality.\xa0\nIt is worth pointing out that many of those who use this excuse do not do so out of conviction and faith, rather they base their argument on whims and desires and stubbornness. Hence one of the scholars said to one such person: “When it comes to obedience you are a Qadari and when it comes to sin you are a Jabari; whatever school of thought suits your whims and desires, you follow it.” (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 8/107).\xa0 In other words, when he did an act of worship or obedience he attributed it to himself and denied that Allah had decreed that, but when he committed a sin he quoted Al-Qadar as an excuse.\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said of those who quote Al-Qadar as an excuse:\xa0\n“If these people persist in this belief they will be worse disbelievers than the Jews and Christians. (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 8/262)\xa0\nBased on this, there is no justification for a person to quote Al-Qadar as an excuse for his faults and sins.\xa0\nAl-Qadar may be invoked when calamities befall a person\nAl-Qadar may be invoked when calamities befall a person such as poverty and sickness, loss of a loved one, destruction of crops, loss of wealth, accidental killing, and so on. This is a sign of full acceptance of Allah as one’s Lord. In this case referring to Al-Qadar is only valid when it has to do with calamities, not faults. The fortunate one is the one who seeks forgiveness for faults and is patient in the face of calamity, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“So be patient (O Muhammad). Verily, the Promise of Allah is true, and ask forgiveness for your fault.” [Ghafir 40:55]\xa0\nThe doomed one is the one who panics at the time of calamity and quotes Al-Qadar as an excuse for sin.\xa0\nThe following example will help to explain this further: if a man is speeding in his car and fails to drive safely and causes an accident, then he is blamed for that and called to account, and he gives Al-Qadar as an excuse, that excuse will not be accepted from him, whereas if a person’s car is struck whilst stationary, and another person blames him and he responds by referring to Al-Qadar , this will be acceptable, unless he was parked in the wrong place.\xa0\nThe point is that whatever a person does and whatever choices he makes cannot be excused by referring to Al-Qadar, but whatever is beyond his will and control may correctly be attributed to Al-Qadar.\xa0\nHence Adam and Musa (peace be upon them) disputed, as is described in the Hadith of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) who said: “Adam and Musa disputed. Musa said to him: ‘You are Adam whose sin caused you to be expelled from Paradise.’ Adam said to him: ‘You are Musa whom Allah chose to convey His message and to speak to; are you blaming me for something that Allah decreed for me before I was created?’ So Adam won the argument with Moses.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2652)\xa0\nAdam (peace be upon him) did not quote Al-Qadar as an excuse for his sin as may be imagined by those who do not think about the meaning of the Hadith, and Musa (peace be upon him) did not blame Adam for his sin, because he knew that Adam had asked his Lord for forgiveness and repented, and his Lord had accepted his repentance and guided him, and the one who repents from sin like one who did not sin.\xa0\nIf Musa had blamed Adam for his sin, he would have replied: “I sinned but then I repented, and Allah accepted my repentance,” or he would have said: “You, O Musa, also killed a soul, and you threw down the Tablets,” and so on. Rather Musa referred to the calamity and Adam responded by referring to Al-Qadar. (See Al-Ihtijaj bi’l-Qadar by Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, 18-22)\xa0\nWhatever calamities are divinely decreed, we must accept them, for that is part of full acceptance of Allah as one’s Lord. With regard to sins, no one has the right to sin; if he does commit sin then he has to seek forgiveness and repent, so he should repent from sin and be patient in the face of calamity.” (Sharh At-Tahhawiyyah , 147)\xa0\nCan the one who repents from sin refer to Al-Qadar as an excuse?\nSome of the scholars said that one of those who are justified in referring to Al-Qadar as an excuse is the one who repents from sin, so if anyone blames him for a sin from which he has repented, he may refer to Al-Qadar in this case.\xa0\nIf it is said to one who has repented: “Why did you do such and such?” and he responds by saying, “That happened by the will and decree of Allah, but I have repented and asked forgiveness,” this excuse is acceptable in his case, because in his case the sin is like a calamity that befell him, and he did not quote Al-Qadar as an excuse for his negligence, rather he is referring to the calamity that befell him, which is disobedience towards Allah. Undoubtedly sin is a kind of calamity, and he is referring to Al-Qadar after the sin took place, and he is admitting his sin. So no one has the right to condemn the one who has repented from sin. What matters is how a person ends up, not the shortcomings that he may commit in the beginning.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.\xa0\nReferences:\xa0\n\nA`lam As-Sunnah Al-Manshurah, 147;\nAl-Qada wal-Qadar fi Daw’ il-Kitab was-Sunnah by Shaykh Dr. `Abd Ar-Rahman Al-Mahmud;\nAl-Iman bil-Qada’ wal-Qadar by Shaykh Muhammad Al-Hamd;\xa0\nAnd the summary by Al-Shaykh Sulayman Al-Khurashi of the belief of Ahl Al-Sunnah in Al-Qadar as discussed in his book Turki Al-Hamd fi Mizan Ahl As-Sunnah.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/49039/can-you-quote-al-qadar-as-an-excuse-for-committing-sins
