488953,What are the reasons why the hadiths were written down?,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe writing down of the hadiths refers, in general terms, to the narrator writing down his reports on paper. This was known from the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nThe main reason for that was to document and protect the reports from being lost or forgotten.\nThis reason is so clear that there is no need for further discussion of proof.\nOne example of that is what was narrated by al-Bukhari (113) from Abu Hurayrah, who said: There is no one among the companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) who narrated more from him than me, except ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr, who wrote down his hadiths and I did not.\nAt the time of the Sahabah and senior Tabi‘in, there were a number of people who wrote down some of their reports, but they did not pay attention to documenting the hadiths in a specific manner, compiling them in books as the Quran was compiled in one mushaf. There are a number of reports which indicate that they were not in favour of compiling the hadiths in a book.\nThere were two reasons for that:\n-1-\nThey wanted to protect the Quran from being abandoned, or to avoid anything being written down at the time when the Sahabah were collecting the Quran in writing, lest the two things become mixed and confused.\n-2-\nAt that time, the hadiths contained only the words and actions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) which explained the verses of the Quran. The isnads (chains of narration) were also brief and were hardly mentioned; they were not so lengthy that the Arabs would not be able to memorize them, for they were people who had excellent memories and were keen to maintain that skill by memorizing things. Moreover, the hadiths are not like the Quran, recitation of which is an act of worship; the hadiths are to be acted upon. As that is the case, there was no need for each of the Sahabah to know all the hadiths with their exact wording; rather it was sufficient for each of them to know some of the hadiths, then ask one another [about other hadiths] when necessary.\nShaykh ‘Abd ar-Rahman al-Mu‘allimi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIn Islamic terms, what matters with regard to the hadiths is their meanings. They are not like the Quran, in which what matters is both the exact wording and the meaning, because it is the word of Allah in both wording and meaning, and is miraculous in both wording and meaning, and it is recited as an act of worship with its wording exactly as it was revealed. So it is no wonder that Allah reduced their burden and made it sufficient, in most cases, for some of the Sahabah to be aware of the hadiths and convey them.""(Al-Anwar al-Kashifah, in Athar al-Mu‘allimi\xa012/43).\nSome of them at that time would narrate hadiths and would seek out hadiths when necessary for practical reasons, so that they could act upon them, without going beyond that.\nShaykh ‘Abd ar-Rahman al-Mu‘allimi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n… It was narrated from ‘Umar that he forbade narrating a lot of hadiths, and he did that for two reasons:\n-1-\n‘Umar’s preference was that narrating hadiths should only be done when needed.\n-2-\nWhat he stated clearly, which was that he preferred people not to be distracted from the Quran by listening to hadiths when there was no need to do so.\nIt was narrated from him that he said: “Narrate few hadiths from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and only narrate that which is needed to be acted upon.”\nThe reference to acting in this quotation is general in meaning, and includes acts of worship, interactions with others and etiquette.""(Al-Anwar al-Kashifah, in Athar al-Mu‘allimi\xa0 12/61).\nDealing with the situation in that manner made it easy for them to memorize what they needed, therefore there was no urgent need to write the hadiths in a book. This is similar to the case of the Quran, which was revealed little by little, which made it easy for them to memorize it without needing to have the entire Quran in one book.\nAl-Khatib al-Baghdadi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIt has been proven that those who did not like to write down hadiths during the early period of Islam only disliked that so that no other book would be given the same importance as the Book of Allah, and the people would not be distracted from the Quran by anything else. Thus the Muslims were forbidden to acquire and read the previous Scriptures, because it is not possible to know what of their contents is true and what is false. Moreover, the Quran is sufficient and there is no need for the earlier Scriptures, because it supersedes them. And books of knowledge were prohibited during the earliest period, when Islam was very new, because there were so few people with proper knowledge at that time who could distinguish between revelation and other things. Most of the Bedouin had no understanding of religion and did not spend time with the scholars and knowledgeable people, so there was the possibility that they might confuse the books of hadith with the words of Allah in the Quran, and might believe that what was contained in the books of hadith was the words of Allah.\nThe people were instructed to memorize hadiths, because the isnads were short, as it was not long after the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). They were forbidden to rely on books, because that would lead to a decline in memorization to the point that it would be almost non-existent, but if there was no writing down of hadiths, then people’s memories would become strong, for a person’s memory is with him wherever he goes.""(Taqyid al-‘Ilm\xa0 p. 57).\nIbn ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThose scholars who disapproved of the writing down of hadiths disapproved for two reasons:\nThe first reason was so that there would be no book that was given the same importance as the Quran.\nThe second reason was so that the one who wrote down hadiths would not rely on what he had written and forego memorizing, in which case there would be fewer people who memorized hadiths.""(Jami‘ Bayan al-‘Ilm wa Fadlihi\xa0 1/292).\nSecondly:\nLater on, especially in the second century AH, there emerged an urgent need to write down the hadiths in books, because the situation had changed. The hadiths had become widely circulated among people, because when the Tabi‘in realized that the number of Sahabah and senior Tabi‘in was declining due to their dying, they strove to seek out the hadiths that they had narrated, which they collected and kept in written form.\nAl-Bukhari (99) narrated from ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Aziz that he wrote to Abu Bakr ibn Hazm, saying: Seek out whatever hadiths of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) are extant and write them down, for I am afraid that with the death of the scholars, knowledge will disappear.\nShaykh ‘Abd ar-Rahman al-Mu‘allimi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAs a matter-of-fact, some of the senior Sahabah thought that conveying of hadiths was only to be done at a time of need, and they thought that if they conveyed hadiths to others when there was no need for that, there was the possibility of error for which they could be called to account, unlike when there was a need, in which case conveying what they knew of hadith was a must, and either Allah would protect them from error or a He would not bring them to account for it. Hence hadiths were narrated from all of them, and it was never narrated from any of them that he knew a hadith, but when there was a need to act according to its guidelines he refused to narrate it.\nSome other Sahabah narrated hadiths even when there was no need for that, because they thought that conveying them before the need arose was something good, as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Narrate from me, and there is nothing wrong with it.” And there is other evidence which speaks of conveying knowledge and conveying hadiths.\nEach of the two views has a point, and the scholars were all aiming to do good.\nBut when the number of Sahabah became few, the view of the second group carried more weight.""(Al-Anwar al-Kashifah, in Athar al-Mu‘allimi\xa012/61).\nThis is like the case of the Quran at the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): there was no urgent need to put it all together in a written book, but as the reciters among the Sahabah who had memorized it began to die one after another, there emerged the need to compile it all in one master copy.\nIt was narrated from ‘Ubayd ibn as-Sabbaq that Zayd ibn Thabit (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Abu Bakr sent for me when the people of Yamamah had been killed (i.e., a number of the Prophet\'s Companions who fought against Musaylimah). (I went to him) and found \'Umar bin al-Khattab sitting with him. Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) said (to me):‘ ‘Umar has come to me and said: Casualties were heavy among the reciters of the Quran (i.e. those who knew the Quran by heart) at the Battle of Yamamah, and I am afraid that more heavy casualties may take place among the reciters on other battlefields, whereby a large part of the Quran may be lost. Therefore I suggest that you [Abu Bakr] should issue orders that the Quran be collected.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (4986).\nAnd there are many similar reports, because the hadiths had begun to include the fatwas and verdicts of the Sahabah, then the views and fatwas of the Tabi‘in.\n‘Abd ar-Razzaq narrated in al-Musannaf (11/258) from Ma‘mar that Salih ibn Kaysan said: I met Ibn Shihab when we were both seeking knowledge, and we agreed to write down some hadiths and other reports. So we wrote down everything that was narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), then we wrote down what was narrated from his companions. I said: No, it is not part of the Sunnah. But he said: Yes, it is part of the Sunnah. So he wrote it down and I did not; he did well and I missed out.\nThen the isnads (chains of narration) became lengthy and numerous, because the number of narrators increased.\nIn addition to that, many views of innovators began to spread among the people, and views based on personal opinion and fabrications of hadiths and reports also became widespread.\nAll of this prompted the leading scholars of hadith and Sunnah to compile what they had collected of hadiths in specialized books, so as to preserve the Sunnah and spread it among people.\nAl-Khatib al-Baghdadi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nScholars only began to write down knowledge and rely on writing down hadiths in books, after having been reluctant to do that, because hadiths and reports had become widespread; isnads had become longer; the names, kunyahs and lineages of narrators had become numerous; and technical terms varied, and people were unable to memorize all of that…""(Taqyid al-‘Ilm\xa0 p. 64).\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nYou should understand, may Allah increase me and you in knowledge, that the reports of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) were not written down in books at the time of his Companions and the senior Tabi‘in, and they were not sorted into categories, for two reasons:\nThe first reason was because, in the beginning, they were forbidden to do that, as is proven in Sahih Muslim, because of the fear that some of that might become mixed with the Quran.\nThe second reason was because they had the ability to memorise things and their minds were clear, and because most of them did not know how to read and write.\nThen towards the end of the time of the Tabi‘in, the writing down of hadiths and reports began, and similar hadiths and reports were grouped together in different categories, when the scholars scattered throughout different regions, and a lot of innovations appeared on the part of the Kharijis, Rafidis and those who denied the divine decree (Qadaris).\nThe first ones to compile the reports in books were ar-Rabi‘ ibn Subayh and Sa‘id ibn Abi ‘Urubah…""(Hadi as-Sari\xa0p. 6).\nThis has to do with general reasons, but there may have been specific reasons too. The author of each book may have had a specific motive, on the basis of which he chose to put hadiths in certain categories. For example, it is well known that al-Bukhari divided his book al-Jami‘ as-Sahih [Sahih al-Bukhari] into various categories for certain reasons.\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAbu ‘Abdillah Muhammad ibn Isma‘il al-Bukhari said: We were with Ishaq ibn Rahawayh and he said: Why do you not write a brief book in which you record the sound hadiths of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)?\nHe said: I liked that idea, so I began to compile the book of al-Jami‘ as-Sahih [Sahih al-Bukhari] …""(Hadi as-Sari\xa0 7).\nAbu Musa al-Madini narrated in Khasa’is Musnad al-Imam Ahmad (p. 14):\nIt was narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn Ahmad ibn Hanbal said: I said to my father (may Allah have mercy on him): Why did you not like people to write books, then you did al-Musnad?\nHe said: I wrote this book to be a reference book, so that if people differed concerning the hadiths of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), they can refer to it.

34575,"I often hear people saying “Madad ya Rasul-Allah, Madad ya Sayyidina Al-Husayn, madad ya Sayyid ya Badawi…” and I do not know the meaning of these words.","['Praise be to Allah.Avoiding unlawful acts of worship in Islam\nIt should be noted that Allah has created the universe to worship Him and Him alone. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And I (Allah) created not the jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me (Alone).” [Adh-Dhariyat 51:56]\nAllah sent the Messengers to call their people to worship Allah alone (Tawhid ) and to forbid them to associate anything with Him (polytheism). Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And We did not send any Messenger before you (O Muhammad) but We revealed to him (saying): La ilaha illa Ana [none has the right to be worshipped but I (Allah)], so worship Me (Alone and none else).” [Al-Anbiya’ 21:25]\nWhat is Shirk?\nPolytheism means directing worship to other than Allah, and Du`a comes under the heading of worship which must be devoted to Allah alone and not directed to anyone else. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Du`a is worship .” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 2969; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Tirmidhi)\xa0\nCan we seek help from other than Allah?\nAsking for Madad (help or support) from anyone other than Allah, as mentioned in the question, is a kind of calling upon (or making Du`a to) someone other than Allah, hence it is a kind of polytheism.\xa0\nIt says in Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah (2/193):\xa0\n“The words of some of those who sing Nashid, “Madad ya sayyidina Al-Husayn (Help O our master Al-Husayn), Madad ya Sayyidah Zaynab, madad ya Badawi ya Shaykh Al-`Arab, madad ya Rasul Allah (O Messenger of Allah), Madad ya awliya’ Allah (O close friends – or ‘saints’ – of Allah),” etc, is major polytheism which puts the one who says it beyond the pale of Islam (Allah forbid), because it is calling upon the dead to give them good things, to help them, to ward off danger or relieve them of harm. That is because what is meant by madad is giving, help and support. So it is as if the person who says, “Madad ya Sayyid ya Badawi, madad ya Sayyidah Zaynab” etc is saying: Help us and give us of your bounty, and relieve us of hardship and ward off calamity from us. This is major polytheism. Allah says, after explaining to His slaves that He is in control of the universe and that it is subjugated to Him:\n“Such is Allah, your Lord; His is the kingdom. And those, whom you invoke or call upon instead of Him, own not even a Qitmir (the thin membrane over the date stone).\nIf you invoke (or call upon) them, they hear not your call; and if (in case) they were to hear, they could not grant it (your request) to you. And on the Day of Resurrection, they will disown your worshipping them. And none can inform you (O Muhammad) like Him Who is the All-Knower (of everything).” [Fatir 35:13-14 – interpretation of the meaning]\xa0\nSo He calls their prayers to others Polytheism.\xa0\nAnd Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And who is more astray than one who calls on (invokes) besides Allah, such as will not answer him till the Day of Resurrection, and who are (even) unaware of their calls (invocations) to them?\nAnd when mankind are gathered (on the Day of Resurrection), they (false deities) will become their enemies and will deny their worshipping.” [Al-Ahqaf 46:6]\xa0\nSo Allah tells us that those who are called upon other than Him, the Prophets and the righteous, are unaware of the call of those who call upon them and will never respond to their calls, and they will be their enemies and will deny their worship of them. \xa0\nAnd Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Do they attribute as partners to Allah those who created nothing but they themselves are created? No help can they give them, nor can they help themselves. And if you call them to guidance, they follow you not. It is the same for you whether you call them or you keep silent. Verily, those whom you call upon besides Allah are slaves like you. So call upon them and let them answer you if you are truthful.” [Al-A`raf 7:191-194]\xa0\n“And whoever invokes (or worships), besides Allah, any other Ilah (god), of whom he has no proof; then his reckoning is only with his Lord. Surely, Al-Kafirun (the disbelievers in Allah and in the Oneness of Allah, polytheists, pagans, idolaters) will not be successful.” [Al-Mu’minun 23:117]\nSo Allah tells us that whoever calls upon anyone other than Allah, among the dead etc., will never succeed because of his disbelief and his calling upon someone other than Allah.\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 181206 , 200862 , 2742 , 201175 , 220340 , 9918 , and 31807 .\xa0\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34575/ruling-on-seeking-help-from-other-than-allah
509477,There is a man who is married to a Christian woman.,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt is not permissible to swear by anything or anyone except by Allah, may He be exalted, or one of His attributes, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever swears by something other than Allah has committed an act of shirk.” Narrated by Abu Dawud (3251) and by at-Tirmidhi (1535), who said: This is a hasan hadith. It was classed as authentic by al-Albani in Irwa’ al-Ghalil (8/189).\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAnother major sin is swearing by anything or anyone other than Allah, as the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever swears by something other than Allah has committed an act of shirk.” The one who said that this is disliked (makruh) has made a serious mistake, because the Lawgiver stated that it is shirk, therefore it is more serious than other major sins.""(I‘lam al-Muwaqqi‘in\xa0 6/571-572).\nThis hadith is general in meaning and applies to both Muslims and disbelievers, because the minor issues of sharia – meaning its rulings – are also addressed to the disbeliever. One of the rulings of sharia is that it is not permissible to swear by anything or anyone other than Allah.\nWali ad-Din al-‘Iraqi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe correct view on which the majority of scholars are agreed is that the minor issues of sharia are addressed to the disbelievers, so silk is prohibited for them as it is for the Muslims.(Tarh at-Tathrib\xa0 3/227).\nBased on that, it is not permissible for anyone to ask another person to swear by someone other than Allah, even if the one who is being asked to swear the oath is not Muslim. Therefore it is not permissible to ask him to swear by his god that he believes in and venerates.\nThe scholars stated that if a disbeliever is required to swear an oath, he should only swear by Allah, such as the Jews, Christians and Zoroastrians, and even the atheists who do not believe in the existence of Allah. They should not be asked to swear by anyone except Allah.\nKhalil ibn Ishaq al-Maliki (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his Mukhtasar (p. 228):\nAn oath to establish rights should be sworn by Allah besides Whom there is no god worthy of worship, even if he [the person being asked to swear the oath] is a Jew or a Christian. End quote.\nAl-Kharashi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his Sharh (7/237):\nThe well-known view is that the Jew or Christian should say this phrase, just like a Muslim, when swearing an oath.\nAs for a Zoroastrian, he should swear by Allah only. End quote.\nIbn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nFor both Muslims and disbelievers, oaths should be sworn by Allah, may He be exalted, because no one should swear by anyone except Him, because He, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {and let them both swear by Allah} [al-Ma’idah 5:106].

End quote.\nThis question was answered by ‘Ala’ ad-Din in Takmilah Haashiyah Ibn ‘Abidin, where he said:\nI say, they should swear by Allah, may He be exalted, because of what was narrated from al-Mabsut in Mi‘raj ad-Dirayah: Free and slave, men and women, evildoers and righteous, disbelievers and Muslims are all the same with regard to swearing oaths, because the purpose here is to pass a judgement, and they all believe that swearing a false oath is prohibited.""(Takmilah Hashiyah Ibn ‘Abidin\xa0 11/618).\nAl-Qadi Shihab ad-Din ibn Abi’d-Dam ash-Shafa‘i said in his book Adab al-Qada’ (1/553, 554):\nIf the one who is swearing an oath is a Dahri who does not believe in any Creator or God, make him swear by Allah, the Creator, the Provider.\nIf it is said that that will not deter him from telling lies, so what benefit is there in it?\nOur response is that there are two benefits in that:\nFirstly, we will be able to pass our judgement concerning them. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): {And judge, [O Muhammad], between them by what Allah has revealed and do not follow their inclinations} [al-Ma’idah 5:49].\nSecondly, he will increase in sin by this oath and will be punished because of the sin, so he may hasten his own punishment by way of (divine) vengeance. End quote.\nThirdly:\nIf a Muslim asks a non-Muslim to swear by his own god, not intending thereby to venerate that god, then he has done something prohibited, but it does not constitute major disbelief (kufr akbar).\nThat is because swearing by something other than Allah constitutes minor disbelief (kufr asghar), not major disbelief.\nBut it may constitute major disbelief if he intended to venerate that god as he venerates Allah, or more.\nUsually the Muslim who does that is either unaware of the prohibition on doing that, or he justifies it on the basis of his thinking that it is permissible in the case of a disbeliever, so that he will not tell lies.\nIn these two cases, the Muslim is not sinning, but after he comes to know the Islamic ruling, he must refrain from doing that, and should not ask anyone to swear an oath by anything or anyone except by Allah.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/509477/is-it-permissible-to-ask-a-non-muslim-to-swear-by-what-he-venerates

It was also narrated by Ibn Al-Mundhir from Malik.” (Al-Mughni, 1/281)\xa0\nThe scholars of the Standing Committee said: \xa0\n“Clasping the hands in prayer means placing the right hand over the left hand, and letting the arms hang means letting them hang down by the sides . It is proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) placed his right hand on his left during prayer, when standing to recite Quran, and when standing after rising from bowing. This is according to the report narrated by Ahmad and Muslim from Wa’il ibn Hajar (may Allah be pleased with him), that he saw the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) raising his hands and saying Takbir when he started to pray, then he wrapped his cloak around himself, then he placed his right hand on his left. When he wanted to bow, he brought out his hands, then he raised them and said Takbir , then he bowed. When he said “Sami`a Allahu liman hamidah (Allah hears the one who praises Him)” he raised his hands , and when he prostrated, he prostrated between his hands.” According to a report narrated by Ahmad and Abu Dawud he said: Then he placed his right hand on his left hand, wrist and forearm. According to a report narrated by Abu Hazim from Sahl ibn Sa`d Al-Sa`idi: The people were commanded to place the right hand on the left forearm when praying.
