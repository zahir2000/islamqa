365477,"Some people analyze the Qurans language in an interesting way. For example, they say that some parts of verses are palindromes (can be read forwards and backward the same way) and they link this to the meaning of the verse. Or they claim that in the phrase ""kun fayakun"" the k is a ""cutting sound"" and the n is a ""vivid sound"" and so the transition from k (cut) to n (vivid) in""kun"" symbolizes something coming into existence, which is linked to the meaning of the phrase ""kun fayakun"".","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe Noble Quran is a sign from Allah, the Exalted and Praised, and Allah has placed within it many signs of truth. Among the signs of its truthfulness and proofs that it is from Allah, the Exalted, are the unique phonetic properties not found in any other text. Indeed, the Quran contains phonetic styles that are unmatched elsewhere.\nDr. Muhammad Daraz says, ""Let the proficient reciter read the Quran; recite it properly, descending upon the inclination of the Quran, and not imposing his own inclinations upon it. Then distance yourself from him to a remote place where you do not hear the ringing of its letters, but you hear its movements and stillness, its elongations and melodies, its connections and pauses, then lend your ear to this phonetic collection, made exclusive and released plainly into the air. You will find yourself facing a strange and wonderful melody; you will not find it in any other speech even if it were rendered exclusive and refined in this manner.\nYou will find a harmony and unity that captivates your hearing as music and poetry do, yet it is not the tunes of music, nor the patterns of rhythm of poetry, and you will find something else that you do not find in music or poetry. That is because you listen to a poem and find its rhythm unified line by line, and part by part, and you listen to a piece of music and find its moods similar and going in a close direction; so your hearing soon rejects it, and your nature tires of it, if it is repeated and recited to you with one signature.\nWhereas with the Quran, you are always in a varied and renewed melody, moving between causes and pegs and pauses in different positions, each string of your heart\'s chords taking an equal share, so that no matter how often it is repeated, it does not bring you boredom or weariness, but you constantly seek more of it,"" End quote.\n""An-Naba\' Al-Adhim"" (p. 133 - 134).\nHe also mentioned the beauty of the articulation points of the letters, saying, ""If you bring your ear a little closer, the jewels of its letters coming out from their correct articulation points will strike your hearing, surprising you with another pleasure in the arrangement of those letters and their lining up, and the ordering of their positions among themselves; this one taps and that one whistles, a third whispers and a fourth declares loudly, another lets the breath slide over it, and another holds the breath. And so on, you see the linguistic beauty manifest before you in a different yet harmonious collection, without rattling or babbling, without softness or harshness, without discord or repulsion.\nThus, you see speech that is neither the bland urban nor the rough Bedouin, but you see it having blended within it the robustness and grandeur of the desert with the delicacy and fluidity of the city, and the matter is measured in such a way that neither exceeds the other. It is as if it is the essence of the two languages, and their progeny, or as if it is the point of contact between the tribes, where their tastes meet, and upon it their hearts agree,"" End quote.\n""An-Naba\' Al-Adhim"" (p. 135).\nSecondly:\nThere is a correlation between the parts of the Noble Quran, which scholars refer to as the coherence between the verses and Surahs. This coherence may be between one Surah and another, between the beginning of a Surah and the one following it, between the verses of a single Surah, and between the beginning and end of a Surah.\n""And there is not a Surah except that it has its own (landmarks) that distinguish it, whether they are short or long Surahs, and the shorter the Surahs, the greater this characteristic becomes. This is clear from the fact that Allah, the Exalted, did not make the short Surahs a single independent Surah except for a great wisdom, which is the independence of each one of them with what distinguishes it from others.""\nSee: ""Misbah Ad-Durar fi Tanasub Ayat Al-Quran Al-Karim wa As-Suwar"" (p. 93).\nThere is also a close proximity between the topics of the Surahs and their objectives, as each Surah of the Quran has a purpose and goal, that is, a significance to which the meanings of the Surah and its content return, and represents its spirit that flows through all its parts.\nThe objective may be the same as the topic of the Surah, or the objective may differ from the topic, in that a single Surah may have a number of topics, and these topics return to one objective.\nKnowing the topics of the Surah and its objective is one of the most important aids to contemplating the Surah and realizing its miraculous nature, because you find that despite the different topics of the Surah, it leads to one goal in a harmony that compels the observer to deem it impossible for this speech to be of human origin.\nThe search for the topics of the Surah and its objective requires certain matters:\nThe most important of which are: understanding the meanings of the Surah, realizing the appropriateness between the verses, and realizing the appropriateness between the Surah and what precedes and follows it. All this makes the reader of the Quran more attentive to what he recites and more present in understanding it.\nAmong the important books in this field are:\n1- Asma\' Suwar Al-Quran wa Fada\'iliha, Dr. Munirah Al-Dosari, Dar Ibn Al-Jawzi, it is an important book in its field.\n2- An-Naba\' Al-Adhim, Dr. Muhammad Daraz, Tafakkur Center.\n3- Muhtawayah Suwar Al-Quran Al-Karim, Sheikh Ahmad Al-Taweel, Dar Al-Watan.\n4- Dalail An-Nizam, by the teacher Abdul Hamid Al-Farahi.\n5- Al-Burhan fi Tanasub Surah Al-Quran, by Imam Ibn Zubair Al-Gharnati, Dar Ibn Al-Jawzi.\n6- At-Tanasub bayna As-Suwar fi Al-Muftatah wa Al-Khawatim, Dr. Fadil Al-Samarrai, Dar Ibn Kathir.\nAnd among the Tafsirs that have taken care of highlighting these aspects are:\n1- Nazm Al-Durar fi Tanasub Al-Ayat wa As-Suwar, by Imam Al-Biqa`i.\n2- At-Tahrir wa At-Tanwir, by Imam Al-Tahir Ibn Ashur.\n3- Masu`at At-Tafsir Al-Mawdu`i, University of Sharjah.\nAnd see: ""Ad-Dalil ila Al-Quran,"" Amr Al-Sharqawi (p. 78).\nThirdly:\nWe have not been able to personally examine the details of the attempts mentioned in the question, nor have we seen anything of them.\nHowever, we mention here some general methodological alerts, which we summarize as follows:\n1- One should not force oneself to research the characteristics of letters and their connection to the word and then the position of this word in the sentence, because this may obscure the main purpose of the Quran, which is to be a book of guidance.\n2- It must be known that this is merely one of the delicacies of the Quran, and its seasoning, and not from the solid knowledge, nor from the general objectives of the Noble Quran, nor the central meanings it brought; rather, it is closer to being, if correct, from the superficial layer as the scholar (Daraz) expresses.\n3- Writing in such a field, and the possibility of contributing one\'s own insights, requires special knowledge and tools; the most important of which are specialization in phonetic studies and related sciences, then proficiency in the sciences of Arabic morphology and rhetoric; and such is not attainable by everyone, so the matter should be put in its proper place, and one should not undertake what one has no knowledge of, nor should one pretend to be an expert in a field for which the tools of research and examination are not complete, even if one\'s tools of research and examination were complete.\n4- If something of this is established for a person, there is no harm in speaking of it, but as his own ijtihad, which should be presented to the solid knowledge, its essence, and its core; and one should not exaggerate in this so that it is said to be from the ""miraculous nature,"" lest the Word of Allah and its miraculous nature be exposed to speculation and debate, as has happened with those concerned with examining aspects of the ""scientific miracles"" of the Noble Quran; and indeed, both extremes in intending matters are reprehensible!!\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/365477/miraculous-language-of-the-quran
12567,"Why is playing cards – I mean only playing, without gambling – counted as haram? We are not playing for money.","['Praise be to Allah.Is playing cards prohibited in Islam?\nThe Standing Committee was asked about playing cards if that does not distract people from prayer and there is no money involved. They answered:\xa0\n“Playing cards is not permitted , even if there is no money involved, because the problem with that is that it distracts people from remembering Allah (Dhikr) and from prayer. Even if they claim that this is not the case, then it is still a means that may lead to gambling which is expressly forbidden in the Quran . Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Intoxicants (all kinds of alcoholic drinks), and gambling, and Al-Ansab (stone altars for sacrifices to false gods) and Al-Azlam (arrows for seeking luck or decision) are an abomination of Shaytan’s (Satan’s) handiwork. So avoid (strictly all) that (abomination) in order that you may be successful.” [Al-Ma’idah 5:90]\nThese cards have an effect on society, for the bonds of a strong society are achieved by means of two things: following the commands of Allah and heeding His prohibitions. A society disintegrates when it neglects any of those duties or does any of those things that are forbidden. These cards form one of the factors which have an effect on society. They cause people to neglect prayer in congregation, and they generate alienation, breaking of ties, hatred and negligence through the committing of haram actions, and they make people too lazy to earn a living.” (Fatawa Islamiyyah, 4/436)\nHistory of playing cards\nWith regard to the history of these playing cards: No one really knows who invented playing cards or when or where they were invented. It has been said that they are of Chinese or Indian origin, or otherwise. But historians agree that they came to Europe from the Middle East in the latter part of the Middle Ages. Experts also say that there is agreement that playing cards have clearly evolved from that time until now.\xa0\nPlaying cards made their first appearance in Europe in Andalusia, and were brought to northern Spain in the eleventh century CE.\xa0\nThe traditional deck of cards in Spain consisted of 40 cards, including the numbers 1 to 7, plus three characters, the highest of which was the “ruler”, followed by the “deputy”, then the “scribe” or “knight.”\xa0\nIn the sixteenth century, the French changed the cards, replacing the “ruler” with the king, the “deputy” with the queen, and the “knight” with the jack. They also added three new numbers, so that the deck now consisted of 52 cards. In the seventeenth century, the Germans added a fourth character, the joker.\xa0\nWe have quoted above the fatwa on playing with these cards. It may also be added that playing cards is devoid of any of the goals of recreational activities as required in Islam; it does not teach any skill that is needed for Jihad or any useful knowledge or bring any social benefit or relaxation that will calm the nerves. Rather it is a game that has nothing good in it; it causes arguments and simply kills time. It is based on speculation and chance, and it is like playing with dice, in that it leads to disputes and fighting, and it is like alcohol and gambling.\xa0\nBased on the above, it would not be farfetched to suggest that it is prohibited rather than disliked, by analogy with dice, because both are based on chance and both lead to arguments.\xa0\nThe same view was favoured by Shaykh Ibn Hajar Al-Haythami (may Allah have mercy on him), and it is the view of our contemporary scholars, and of Shaykh Muhammad ibn Salih Al-`Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) among the jurists of Al-Najd, who transmitted it from his shaykhs. This is based on the fact that it leads to enmity and hatred, and because it is a great waste of time and it distracts people from remembering Allah (Dhikr) and keeps them from worshipping and obeying Him.\xa0\nThis view is further supported by the fact that one of the French kings issued orders banning people from playing cards during the day, and stating that everyone who went against this order was to be arrested and punished. That was because the French people loved playing cards too much, to such an extent that they were neglecting their work in order to play cards. The punishment dictated by this French king was not just a brief imprisonment, he also added a severe beating as a deterrent to others.\xa0\nYet despite these decrees and others, he did not succeed in uprooting the habit of playing cards; the only result was that the people started to play in secret rather than openly.\xa0(From Qadaya Al-Lahw wat Tarfih by Madun Rashid, p. 185-187)\nFor more details, please refer to the following answers: 120806 , 335520 , 95409 , and 181642 .\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12567/is-playing-cards-prohibited
397034,"I have sworn an oath about this sin I have been addicted to and I am trying desperately to rid myself of it. In my oath, I stated that if I do this sin, for a week I will have to perform ghusl every day and pray 8 rakah nawafil as expiation. And If I repeat the sin, another week will be added, and so on. I have been stuck in this loop and keep doing the sin and now I owe over 6 months of prayers, this has become extremely burdensome for me to carry out and I am now struggling mentally and externally to cope with my addiction. I have stated in my oath that if I do this sin, and do not do the expiation of ghusl and 8 rakah for even a day, I will have committed kufr, I am wasting huge amounts of water and time performing this every day, and my family is fed up. Is there any way for me to break free from this loop and expiate the oath?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIf someone swears that if they commit a sin, they will perform ghusl\xa0(a full-body ritual wash)\xa0every day and pray eight optional Rak`ahs for a week, and if they repeat the sin, they will add another week, then if they fall into sin and do not perform the ghusl and do not pray, they have broken their oath, and they must perform the expiation for breaking an oath. This will release them from their oath.\nThe expiation for breaking an oath is: freeing a slave, or feeding ten needy people, or clothing them. If one cannot do these, then fasting for three days is required, as Allah the Exalted says (translation of the meaning):\n{Allah will not impose blame upon you for what is meaningless in your oaths, but He will impose blame upon you for [breaking] what you intended of oaths. So its expiation is the feeding of ten needy people from the average of that which you feed your [own] families or clothing them or the freeing of a slave. But whoever cannot find [or afford it] - then a fast of three days [is required]. That is the expiation for oaths when you have sworn. But guard your oaths.} This verse is from Surat Al-Ma\'idah/89.\nIt is sufficient to give each needy person a meal, or one and a half kilograms of rice.\nSecondly:\nIf someone swears that if they commit a sin and do not perform the ghusl and pray eight Rak`ahs, even for just one day, they will become a disbeliever, they have sinned by making this prohibited oath, but they do not become a disbeliever by doing so; because they detest disbelief and want to prevent themselves from something, so they make it severe by mentioning something they hate and are repelled by, which is disbelief.\nHowever, if they break the oath: they must perform the expiation for breaking an oath.\nAt-Tirmidhi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his Sunan (4/115): ""The scholars have differed concerning this matter when a man swears by a religion other than Islam, saying: \'He is a Jew or a Christian if he does such and such,\' and then he does that thing. Some of them said: \'He has done something grave and there is no expiation upon him,\' and this is the view of the people of Madinah, and it is the view of Malik ibn Anas. Abu `Ubaid also held this view.\nSome of the scholars among the Companions (may Allah be pleased with him) and the Successors and others said: \'He must perform expiation,\' and this is the view of Sufyan, Ahmad, and Ishaq."" End quote.\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n""If he says: \'He is a Jew or a Christian if he does such and such,\' or \'He is a disbeliever if he does such and such,\' then the Imams are agreed that if the condition is met, he does not become a disbeliever, but he must perform the expiation for breaking an oath according to Abu Hanifah and Ahmad in the well-known view from him. According to Malik and Ash-Shafi`i, there is nothing upon him.\nUnlike if he says: \'If you give me the dirhams, I will disbelieve,\' then he does become a disbeliever by that; his disbelief is enacted immediately [i.e., he disbelieves right away just by saying these words]; because he intended the occurrence of disbelief when the condition is met."" End quote from ""Majmu` al-Fatawa"" (33/199).\nIn conclusion:\nYou are required to perform two expiations, one for swearing by Allah and another for swearing on disbelief. With this, you will be released from this predicament you have put yourself in. Then you should strive to abandon the sin and treat the addiction to it, and we ask Allah to accept from you and to help you.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/397034/swearing-to-pray-if-she-breaks-an-oath-or-she-is-not-a-muslim
39408,What is the ruling on putting nutmeg in food? Is it permissible to sell it?,"['Praise be to Allah.What is nutmeg?\nThe nutmeg tree is used as a kind of spice which gives food a fragrant smell and delicious taste. The ancient Egyptians used it as a medicine for stomach disease and to expel wind.\xa0\nIts effects are like those of hashish. If it is consumed in large quantities, a person ringing in his ears, severe constipation, difficulty urinating, anxiety, stress, suppression of the central nervous system and possibly death.\xa0\nIs nutmeg prohibited?\nWith regard to the rulings on it, the scholars differed and there are two opinions.\xa0\nThe majority of scholars are of the view that it is prohibited to use it in small and large quantities. Others are of the view that it is permissible to use a little of it if it is mixed with other substances. \xa0\nIbn Hajar Al-Haytami (d. 974 AH) (may Allah have mercy on him) said concerning nutmeg:\xa0\n“When there was a dispute concerning it between the scholars of the Haramayn and Egypt, and there were differences of opinion as to whether it is permissible or prohibited, this question arose: Did any of the imams or their followers state that it is prohibited to eat nutmeg?\xa0\nTo sum up the answer – as was stated clearly by Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Daqeeq Al-Eid – it is an intoxicant. Ibn Al-`Imad went further and regarded hashish as comparable to it. The Malikis, Shafa’is and Hanbalis agreed that it is an intoxicant and comes under the general text: “Every intoxicant is Khamr and all Khamr is prohibited.” The Hanafis are of the view that it is either an intoxicant or a drug, either of which affects the mind, so it is prohibitedin either case.” (See: Az-Zawajir `an Iqtirab Al-Kaba’ir (1/212) and Al-Mukhaddirat by Muhammad `Abd Al-Maqsud (p. 90)\nDuring the eighth conference of medical Fiqh – “The Islamic View on Some Health Problems – prohibited and Impure Substances in Food and Medicine” – which was held in Kuwait between 22-24 Dhul-Hijjah 1415 AH (22-24 May 1995), they said:\xa0\n“Narcotic substances are prohibited, and it is not permissible to consume them unless that is for a specific medical purpose, and in the amount specified by doctors, but they are pure in and of themselves.\xa0\nThere is nothing wrong with using nutmeg to improve the flavour of food, in small amounts that do not cause listlessness or intoxication.”\nShaykh Dr. Wahbah Az-Zuhayli (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“There is no reason why a small amount of nutmeg should not be used to improve the flavour of food, cakes and the like, but a large amount is prohibited, because it is a narcotic.”\xa0\nBut to be on the safe side we should say that it is not allowed even if it is mixed with other things and there is only a small amount of it, because “that which intoxicates in large amounts, a small amount of it is prohibited.”\xa0\nIt should be noted that it is prohibited to import nutmeg – both seed and powder – into the Land of the Two Holy Mosques (i.e., Saudi Arabia) and it is permitted only to import it when it is mixed with other spices in permitted proportions, which is no more than 20%.\xa0\nFor more details, please refer to the following answers: 82116 , 227982 , 125974 , 107381 , 114855 , and 111827 .\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/39408/is-nutmeg-prohibited
