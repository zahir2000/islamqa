112708,"I got a high-speed Internet connection to my house, and because the price of subscription is too high for my budget, I installed a switch and distributed cables to some of my neighbours, so that we can share the cost of the monthly subscription. My question is: do I share the burden of sin if these neighbours use the Internet for things that incur the wrath of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted? What is the solution?","['Praise be to Allah.The Internet is a means that may be used for good or evil, what is permissible and what is prohibited. If those who use it are not religiously committed people who adhere to the limits set by their Lord, then their usage may not be free from haram activities such as downloading images, music and movies, and participating in immoral chats, and the like. Therefore it is not permissible to give an Internet connection to anyone who you think most likely will use it for haram purposes. You should choose those of your neighbours who you think will never use it for haram purposes. Otherwise, you should keep your connection to yourself, even if it costs you more, so as to avoid helping anyone in sin.\nYou can also get a connection from an existing group that is already sharing the Internet connection, then you will be free of the issue of helping others in what is haram and telling them about it.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/112708/he-shared-his-internet-connection-with-his-neighbours-despite-the-possibility-that-they-may-use-it-for-sinful-purposes
161629,"Please could you tell me the basic guideline on marriage in Islam with regard to relatives? I know that it is permissible for a person to marry paternal cousins, but what is the ruling on marrying one’s father’s paternal cousin? And what is the ruling on my daughter marrying the nephew of my mother-in-law? Please advise me, may Allah reward you with good.","['Praise be to Allah.Allah, may He be Exalted, has mentioned women who are forbidden in marriage because of kinship. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Forbidden to you (for marriage) are: your mothers, your daughters, your sisters, your father\'s sisters, your mother\'s sisters, your brother\'s daughters, your sister\'s daughters…”\xa0[An-Nisa’ 4:23]\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\nThese are seven who are forbidden in marriage, according to the text and scholarly consensus; none of the scholars differed concerning this."" (Al-Sharh Al-Mumti`, 12/53)\nThey are:\xa0\n\nThe mother, which includes grandmothers on both the father’s and mother’s side\nThe daughter, which includes granddaughters\nSisters , whether full sisters or half-sisters through the father or mother\nThe paternal aunt, which also includes the paternal aunt of the father or mother\nThe maternal aunt , which also includes the maternal aunt of the father or mother\nThe brother’s daughter, which includes his granddaughters\nThe sister’s daughter, which includes her granddaughters\n\nAny other women who are relatives, apart from these, are permissible for marriage. Hence Allah, may He be Exalted, says in the following verse (interpretation of the meaning): “All others are lawful…”\xa0 [An-Nisa’ 4:24]\xa0\nBased on that, the daughter of one’s paternal uncle or aunt, or of one’s maternal uncle or aunt, are permissible in marriage. The Quran states that in the verse (interpretation of the meaning):\n“O Prophet (Muhammad )! Verily, We have made lawful to you your wives, to whom you have paid their Mahr (bridal money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage), and those (slaves) whom your right hand possesses - whom Allah has given to you, and the daughters of your paternal uncles and the daughters of your paternal aunts and the daughters of your maternal uncles and the daughters of your maternal aunts…”\xa0[Al-Ahzab 33:50]\xa0\nBased on this, it is permissible for a girl to marry her father’s paternal cousin , because a person’s paternal uncle is an uncle to him and to all his offspring. So her father’s paternal uncle is also an uncle to her, and his son is her cousin, and it is permissible for a girl to marry her paternal cousin.\xa0\nit is also permissible for your daughter to marry the son of your mother-in-law’s brother, because the brother of your mother-in-law is her maternal uncle, because he is the maternal uncle of her father, and the maternal uncle of one’s father is also an uncle to his children. And it is permissible for a girl to marry her maternal cousin.\xa0\nFor more details, please see this category: Women Who are Forbidden for Marriage\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/161629/women-forbidden-for-marriage-in-islam-due-to-kinship
263615,"How can I know what work is prohibited and what is lawful? Because here in Germany there are many jobs that are unlawful or dubious. Many times I have read that if someone works in a place where alcohol or pork are sold, it is unlawful for him to work in that place.","['Praise be to Allah.Which jobs are permissible in Islam?\nThe guideline on permissible work is that it should be in a permissible field and should not involve helping others to commit unlawful acts.\nThis includes working in buying and selling, and rental, of permissible things such as selling food, medicine, tools and equipment, and the like. It also includes working in teaching, medicine, engineering, electricity, carpentry, and manufacturing, and innumerable other permissible types of work.\nWhich jobs are Prohibited in Islam?\nAs for unlawful work , that includes: working in Riba-based banks or commercial insurance companies, or carrying alcohol , or raising pigs , or writing down contracts of Riba, or equipping places for gambling, or selling things that it is thought most likely will be used for unlawful purposes, such as selling weapons to bandits, and other things that are regarded as prohibited and sinful, or helping in it directly or almost directly .\nAs for helping in it indirectly, whilst not intending to help in sin and transgression, that is not unlawful. That includes selling permissible food to a disbeliever, one who deals in Riba, or one who gambles. It cannot be said that by means of this food one is nourishing them and giving them the strength to commit sin. If indirectly helping them was forbidden, then people would never find permissible work except in very rare cases.\nHence the Companions used to deal with the Jews, buying and selling, renting, and so on, because they benefited from such activities.\nIf the work in and of itself is permissible, and does not involve directly helping anyone to commit unlawful acts, it is permissible.\nThis is the guideline that we can mention in this regard, with regard to whether work is lawful or prohibited.\nBased on that, if there is a bakery that sells permissible types of bread, and other types that are unlawful because they are contain alcohol, for example, and the worker’s role is limited to dealing with the permissible bread, and he is not helping with that which is unlawful in any way, then in the case of extreme need it is permissible for him to do this job, but he should look for other work, because seeing the evil deed makes it obligatory for him to object to it, and he may not be able to do that. So he should leave the place in that case, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And it has already come down to you in the Book that when you hear the verses of Allah [recited], they are denied [by them] and ridiculed; so do not sit with them until they enter into another conversation. Indeed, you would then be like them. Indeed Allah will gather the hypocrites and disbelievers in Hell all together.”\xa0[An-Nisa’ 4:140]\nAl-Jassas (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Ahkam Al-Quran (2/407):\xa0\n“This verse indicates that it is obligatory to express the objection to an evil deed to the one who is doing it, and that part of objecting to it is expressing displeasure, if it is not possible to remove it, and to refrain from sitting with the one who is doing it, and to get up and leave him, until he stops doing that and begins to do something else.”\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: What is the ruling on working for the owners of shops selling gold, in which they engage in transactions that are Islamically unacceptable, whether that is dealing with Riba, using prohibited tricks, deceiving customers, and other transactions that are not acceptable according to shari‘ah?\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) replied:\xa0\n“Working for these people who deal in Riba, use deceit, and other prohibited things is prohibited, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“but do not cooperate in sin and aggression.”\xa0[Al-Ma’idah 5:2]\n“And it has already come down to you in the Book that when you hear the verses of Allah [recited], they are denied [by them] and ridiculed; so do not sit with them until they enter into another conversation. Indeed, you would then be like them. Indeed Allah will gather the hypocrites and disbelievers in Hell all together.”\xa0[An-Nisa’ 4:140]\nAnd because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: ““Whoever among you sees an evil action, then let him change it with his hand [by taking action]; if he cannot, then with his tongue [by speaking out]; and if he cannot, then with his heart [by hating it].” But the one who works with them is not changing anything, whether with his hand, his tongue or his heart, so he is disobeying the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).” (Fiqh wa Fatawa Al-Buyu‘, p. 392)\nSo this friend of yours should look for another job in which he will be able to avoid seeing evil.\nBut so long as he does not go near the pork or help with it in any way, then his salary is lawful, because it is in return for his work with the permissible bread, but he is sinning by not objecting the evil, and this is what makes it necessary for him to look for another job.\nThus you will know that there is nothing wrong with you eating his food or accepting his gifts, for his salary is permissible.\nCan you work in commercial insurance companies?\nWorking in commercial insurance companies is prohibited, because commercial insurance is based on Riba (usury) and gambling .\nBut with regard to wealth that is unlawful because of the manner in which it is acquired, it is only prohibited for the one who acquires it; so there is no blame on the one who takes it from him in a lawful manner, such as gifts, maintenance and the like.\nBased on that, there is nothing wrong with you eating food or accepting anything of the wealth of the one who works in this unlawful insurance field.\nThirdly:\nHow to earn lawful money\nThe ways of earning a lawful income are many, but the matter may need some research and effort. Whoever fears Allah, may He be exalted, He will grant him provision and help him, as He, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And whoever fears Allah - He will make for him a way out.\nAnd will provide for him from where he does not expect. And whoever relies upon Allah - then He is sufficient for him. Indeed, Allah will accomplish His purpose. Allah has already set for everything a [decreed] extent.”\xa0[At-Talaq 65:2-3]\nSo strive to look for permissible work, that is free of mixing and seeing evil things. Caution in this regard is something praiseworthy, for whoever strives to avoid dubious matters will protect his religious commitment from shortcomings and will protect his honour from slander, and whoever falls into doubtful matters will soon fall into prohibited matters.\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said:\n“Whoever guards against the doubtful matters will protect his religious commitment from shortcomings and will protect his honour from slander, but whoever falls into that which is doubtful will fall into that which is prohibited, like a shepherd who grazes his flock around prohibited land; he will soon graze in it.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 52, and Muslim, 1599)\nAnd he said: “Leave that which makes you doubt for that which does not make you doubt.” Narrated by At-Tirmidhi (2518) and An-Nasa’i (5711). At-Tirmidhi said: This is an authentic Hadith. It was classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Tirmidhi.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/263615/islamically-permissible-and-prohibited-jobs-in-the-west
98580,"I wore the socks under my shoes after performing Wudu. Then I made Wudu and wiped on the shoes. If I take my shoes off, am I permitted to continue the wiping for the allowed period of time, wiping on my socks?","['Praise be to Allah.If a person wears Khuff (leather socks) over socks , or Khuff over Khuff, to which of them does the ruling apply? That is subject to further discussion. \xa0\nShaykh Muhammad ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \xa0\n\nIf he puts on socks or Khuff then invalidates his Wudu , then he puts something else on before he does Wudu, then the ruling applies to the first one. This means if he wants to wipe over them after that, he must wipe over the first one, and it is not permissible for him to wipe over the upper layer.\nIf he puts on socks or Khuff , then loses his Wudu and wipes over them, then he puts something else on over them, then he may wipe over the second layer, according to the correct opinion.\n\nIt says in Al-Furu`: ‘It is permissible according to Malik.’ An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: ‘This appears to be more correct because he put them on when he was in a state of purity, and the suggestion of those who say that purity is not complete is not acceptable.’\xa0\nIf we accept that, then it is the beginning of the period during which he may wipe (over the Khuff or socks ), and in this case he may wipe over the first (layer) without a doubt.\xa0\n\nIf he puts a Khuff over a Khuff or socks , and wipes over the top layer then takes it off, can he wipe over the lower layer for the remainder of the period? I have not seen anyone who explicitly stated this, but An-Nawawi narrated from Abu Al-`Abbas ibn Surayj, concerning a case where an overshoe is worn over the Khuff: they are like a single Khuff, of which the upper layer is visible and the lower layer is hidden. I say: based on that, it is permissible to wipe over the lower layer until the period for wiping over the upper layer ends, such as if the upper layer of the Khuff is scratched off, he may wipe over the lower layer.” (Fatawa At-Taharah by Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin, p. 192)\xa0\n\n“The overshoe or galosh is a Khuff that is worn over the ordinary Khuff, especially in cold countries.\xa0What is meant by the upper and lower (or outer and inner) layers is if there is a Khuff of two layers, then the upper layer is called the outer and the lower layer is called the inner.” (Al-Sharh Al-Mumti`, 1/211)\xa0\nThus it is clear that if a person wears Khuff over socks, then he takes off the upper or outer layer of the two, if he wipes over it, then his taking it off does not invalidate his wiping, and he may wipe over the lower or inner layer, in all the cases mentioned by Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him), until the end of the period for wiping over the Khuff or socks .\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/98580/wearing-a-khuff-over-socks-which-to-wipe-over-in-wudu
