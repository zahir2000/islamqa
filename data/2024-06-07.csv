130263,"We use a classroom to pray in. Recently they have put up posters with guidelines regarding hazardous materials, and the images include images of humans. Is it permissible to pray in this room?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe basic principle is that men should pray in congregation in the mosque, but if there is the fear that some employees may mess about and take too long to come back to work on the grounds that they are going to pray, or the work will be affected, then in that case there is nothing wrong with praying in the workplace.\nPlease see the answers to questions no. 72895 and 74978 .\nSecondly:\nIt is not permissible to pray in places in which there are images of animate beings, except in the case of necessity, because of the report narrated by al-Bukhari (3322) and Muslim (2106) from Abu Talhah (may Allah be pleased with him) from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), who said: “The angels do not enter a house in which there is a dog or an image.”\nThe scholars of the Permanent Committee for Ifta’ were asked:\nIs it permissible for a Muslim to pray in a room of which the walls are covered with images of animals, humans and so on?\nIs it permissible for a Muslim to pray in a garment on which there are images of animals?\nThey replied:\nMaking images of animate beings is haram, and putting images of animate beings on walls and the like is also haram. Praying in a place in which there are such images is not permissible, except in the case of necessity. Similarly, praying in garments on which there are images of animals is not permissible, but if a person does that, his prayer is valid, although that is haram. It is soundly narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that when he saw a curtain in ‘A’ishah’s house on which there were images [of animate beings], he got angry and tore it down, and he said: “The makers of these images will be punished on the Day of Resurrection, and it will be said: Give life to what you have created.”""(Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah\xa0 1/705).\nThey were also asked:\nWe have been working in government departments for several years. They allocated to us one of the distribution halls in the building in which we work, where we pray in congregation during working hours. A while ago, on the front wall in the direction of the qiblah, they put up some large pictures of famous people. We are greatly troubled by the presence of these pictures in front of us when we pray. What do you think about the placing of pictures in the place that has been allocated for the Muslims to pray in for some time? Should we continue to pray there when these pictures are there?\nThey replied:\nThe prayer is valid, and there is no blame on them for that, in sha Allah, if they have no option but to pray in the place mentioned because there is no mosque nearby. But they must try their best to persuade the people in charge to remove the pictures from that place, or give them another place to pray in which there are no pictures or images. That is because praying in a place in which there are pictures or images in front of the worshippers is resembling the idol worshippers, and there are many hadiths which indicate that it is not allowed to resemble the enemies of Allah, and it is enjoined to differ from them. Moreover, putting images of animate beings on walls is something that is not permissible; rather it is one of the means that lead to drifting away and associating others with Allah (shirk), especially if they are images of people who are held in high esteem.""(Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah\xa0 6/250-251).\nBased on that, the prayer offered in this classroom is valid, but you must try hard to get these pictures removed, or at least obliterate the features of the faces, after which there will be no need to remove them.\nIf you are not able to do that, then try to find another place to pray that is free of such pictures and images. But if it is not possible to do that, then there is no blame on you if you pray in this classroom, because you have no choice but to pray there. But it is still important to advise the people in charge to remove these pictures.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/130263/is-it-permissible-to-pray-in-a-room-in-which-there-are-images-of-animate-beings
125711,Is there any reference in the Holy Quran on stoning at the Jamarat?,"['Praise be to Allah.Is Stoning the Jamarat Part of Hajj?\nStoning the Jamarat is one of the obligatory rituals of Hajj and is prescribed for everyone who intends to do this great pilgrimage. This ritual is mentioned clearly in the Sunnah and its authenticity is agreed upon by the scholars.\xa0\nIt was narrated from Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) seated Al-Fadl behind him on his mount, and Al-Fadl (may Allah be pleased with him) said that he did not stop reciting the Talbiyah until he stoned the Jamrah .\xa0(Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 1685 and Muslim, 1282)\nIt was narrated from `Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) that he came to the largest Jamrah and put the House on his left and Mina on his right and stoned it with seven (pebbles), and he said: This is how the one to whom Surat Al-Baqarah was revealed (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) stoned it.\xa0(Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 1748 and Muslim , 1296)\xa0\nIt was narrated from Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that he would stone Al-Jamrah Ad-Dunya (the Jamrah near the Khayf mosque) with seven pebbles, saying Takbir after every throw. Then he would go ahead until he reached the level ground where he would stand facing the Qiblah, and he stood for a long time, offering Du`a and raising his hands. Then he would stone the middle pillar, then he would move to the left towards the middle ground, where he would stand facing the Qiblah. He would remain there for a long time offering du’a’ and raising his hands. Then he would stone Jamarat Al-`Aqabah from the middle of the valley, but he did not stand beside it. Then he would leave and say: This is how I saw the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) doing it.\xa0(Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 1751)\xa0\nIbn Al-Mundhir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Scholars unanimously agreed that if a person stones the Jamarat during the days of At-Tashriq after the sun has passed the meridian, that is valid.” (Al-Ijma` by Ibn Al-Mundhir, 11)\nIbn Hazm (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Scholars agreed that the three days after the Day of Sacrifice are the days for stoning the Jamarat, and that the one who stoned them during those days after the meridian, that is valid.” (Maratib Al-Ijma` by Ibn Hazm, 46)\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“When he reaches Mina, he should start with Jamarat Al-`Aqabah , which is the furthest of the Jamarat from Mina and the closest of them to Makkah, and it is at Al-`Aqabah, hence it is also called Jamarat Al-`Aqabah . He should stone it with seven pebbles, saying Takbir with each throw. He should stand at the middle of the valley and turn to face the Qiblah, then he should leave and should not stay there. This is a summary of the views of those scholars whose views we know.”\xa0 (Al-Mughni, 3/218)\xa0\nWhy do we throw stones at the Jamarat?\nAbu Hamid Al-Ghazali (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“As for the stoning of the Jamarat , the purpose behind it is to follow the command and manifest submission and servitude to Allah, and show complete obedience without rational thought or the ego having any part in it. The aim is also to imitate Ibrahim (peace be upon him), when Shaytan (may Allah curse him) appeared to him in that place to instil confusion in his mind or tempt him to sin, and Allah commanded him to throw stones at him so as to drive him away and dash his hopes. If you ever think that the Shaytan appeared to him and he saw him and that is why he stoned him, but as for me, the Shaytan did not appear to me, it should be noted that this thought is from the Shaytan and that he is the one who is putting it into your mind, so as to slow you down when you are throwing and you will imagine that it is an action in which there is nothing good and that it is like playing, so why should you bother with it? Expel him from your mind with a serious attitude and determination to throw the pebbles despite the Shaytan. Remember that you are outwardly throwing pebbles at Al-`Aqabah, but in fact you are throwing them in the face of the Shaytan and you are breaking his back with them, because nothing annoys him except your obeying the command of Allah out of veneration for Him, simply because of His command, and the soul and mind have nothing to do with it.” (Ihya’ `Ulum Ad-Din, 1/270)\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/125711/is-stoning-the-jamarat-part-of-hajj
506997,Is praying to increase ones height considered as the transgressions of dua?,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nWhen a person has passed the growth stage, meaning that it is usually not possible to increase in height, then praying to increase one’s height is a transgression of du`a (supplication).\nWhat we have found out regarding the age at which a man stops growing is:\nA growth spurt begins in males at the onset of puberty – i.e., between 10 and 13 years of age – and usually they continue to grow until the age of 16, but growth may continue after that time until the early 20s.\nIn response to a question about when a man stops growing, there are other factors which may affect that, such as:\n\nGenes inherited from the father and mother. This is one of the most significant factors that may play an important role in growth, as it has an impact of 80% on how much a person will grow.\nLevels of hormones in the blood, such as growth hormones, thyroid hormones and reproductive hormones, and whether there is any problem with the levels of these hormones.\nDiet and the extent to which essential nutrients are found in it.\nActivity levels during childhood.\nThe mother’s nutrition during pregnancy.\nThe individual’s state of health and whether there are any chronic illnesses that could affect growth.\nThe presence of genetic discrepancies in some hereditary conditions, such as Down syndrome and Marfan syndrome.\n\nEnd quote from at-Tibb website.\nIf specialist doctors state that a man has reached an age after which it is usually impossible for him to grow any further, then praying for an increase in height is a transgression of du`a, because of what it involves of poor etiquette towards Allah by asking Him to do something different to what He has decreed for His creation.\nAbu Dawud (96), Ibn Majah (3864) and Ahmad (16847) narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn Mughaffal heard his son say: O Allah, I ask You for the white palace on the right-hand side of Paradise, if I enter it. He said: O my son, ask Allah for Paradise and seek refuge with Him from Hell, for I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “There will be people among this ummah who will transgress in purification and supplication.”\nThis hadith was classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud.\nAl-Qarafi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The second category of that which is prohibited but does not reach the level of disbelief is when a supplicant asks Allah, may He be exalted, for things that are ordinarily impossible unless one is a prophet, for the usual practice of the prophets (blessings and peace be upon them) is to do extraordinary feats or miracles, so that is permissible for them, as they called for a table to be sent down from heaven, and for the she-camel to be brought forth from the solid rock…\nAs for what is prohibited, there are several examples:\n1. Asking Allah, may He be exalted, to make you have no need to breathe air, so as to be protected from suffocation, when usually that is impossible.\n2. Asking Allah, may He be exalted, for freedom from sickness all your life, so that you can benefit from your strength, senses and physical faculties throughout your life, when usually that is impossible.\n3. Asking Allah, may He be exalted, for a child without having intercourse, or for fruits without planting and tending trees, when usually that is impossible, so asking for that constitutes poor etiquette towards Allah, may He be exalted…\nRather every wise person must understand the way in which Allah, may He be exalted, manages and controls His creation, and he should recognise the connection between cause and effect in this world and the hereafter, whilst acknowledging the possibility that by His power, effects may come about through other causes or without any cause at all, for in fact Allah, may He be exalted, has ordained His dominion according to a particular system and has set it up with all the natural laws that He has ordained and decreed, and He is not to be questioned about what He does [al-Anbiya’ 21:23]. So if the supplicant asks Allah, may He be exalted, to change His dominion and go against the system that He has ordained, and to do things in a manner other than that in which He usually does them in His dominion, then he is showing poor etiquette towards Allah, may He be glorified and exalted; in fact that would be poor etiquette towards the lowest of rulers and even governors.""(Al-Furuq\xa0 4/368).\nSecondly:\nWhat is meant by the jawline is the outline of the jaw and its shape from the side.\nThere is nothing wrong with defining the jawline by means of exercises, but not by means of surgery or injecting fillers.\nThese exercises – according to what we found out – have other benefits besides defining the jawline.

219643,I heard that it is not permissible for a man to wear shoes that cover the top of the feet when doing tawaf (during Ihram – this is the view of a number of Hanafis). Is that true? Or is it permissible to wear all kinds of shoes?,"['Praise be to Allah.What the pilgrim in Ihram may wear on his feet is of several kinds, for each of which there is a ruling. In general terms, they may be summed up in three categories:\xa0\nProhibited footwear for pilgrims in Ihram\n\nThat which covers the entire foot , plus the ankles [which are the two bones that protrude at the joint between the leg and the foot], such as the Khuff (a type of leather slipper have comes up past the ankle), boots that cover the ankle, army boots, and so on.\n\nSuch shoes are not permissible for the pilgrim in Ihram to wear, because of the report narrated by Al-Bukhari (1543) and Muslim (1177) from `Abdullah ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which a man said: O Messenger of Allah, what garments can the pilgrim in Ihram wear? The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “He should not wear chemises, head coverings, pants, burnooses, or Khufuf (leather slippers), except for one who cannot find sandals, in which case he may wear Khufuf, but he should cut them so that they come lower than the ankles.”\xa0\nThis Hadith clearly states that it is prohibited for the pilgrim in Ihram to wear Khufuf, and this is applicable by analogy to similar footwear that also covers the entire foot and ankle.\xa0\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Wearing the Khuff (leather slipper) is prohibited for the man who is in Ihram, and this is agreed upon, whether the Khuff is intact or has holes in it, because of the general meaning of the authentic Hadith.” (Al-Majmu` Sharh Al-Muhadhdhab, 7/258)\xa0\nPermissible sandals for pilgrims in Ihram\n\nThe sandal is that which is the same size as the sole of the foot, but leaves the top of the feet, the heels and the ankles uncovered. There is nothing wrong with wearing it (when in Ihram).\xa0\n\nIn fact it is proven in the Sunnah that it is recommended to enter Ihram wearing sandals. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Let one of you enter Ihram wearing an Izar (waist wrapper or lower garments), Rida’ (upper garment) and sandals.” (Narrated by Ahmad in his Musnad, 8/500; classed as authentic by Ibn Khuzaymah, 2601)\xa0\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “With regard to sandals, it is permissible to wear them no matter how they look, and it is not necessary to cut anything from them, because the ruling that they are permissible was narrated in general terms.” (Al-Mughni, 5/123)\xa0\nAl-Juwayni (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“With regard to sandals, they may be worn by the pilgrim in Ihram, even if they have a strap that comes over the top of the foot. There is nothing wrong with anything that is called sandals, even if the straps are wide. There may be a need to make it wide if one wants to walk for long distances.” (Nihayat Al-Matlab fi Dirayat Al-Madhhab, 4/251)\xa0\nIn Tuhfat Al-Muhtaj (4/162) it says:\n“What is meant by sandals is a kind of footwear that does not cover all the toes.”\xa0\nIt says in Matalib uli An-Nuha (2/329):\n“It is permissible for the pilgrim in Ihram to wear sandals, even if the sandal has a strap going across the foot and another strap going around the heel.”\xa0\nThe point is that it does not matter if the sandal has straps that help to keep it on the foot, whether the straps go across the toes or around the heel.\xa0\nControversy over footwear that covers the ankles\n\nIf the shoe does not cover the ankles, but it covers the rest of the foot, such as the toes, the top of the foot and the heel, then there is a difference of scholarly opinion as to whether it may be worn (in Ihram), because of the difference of opinion as to whether it resembles the Khuff (leather slipper) or sandal. Some scholars think that because it covers most of the foot, it should be regarded as being like the Khuff and should be disallowed for that reason. Others think that because it does not cover the ankles, it comes under the same ruling as sandals and is permissible. The majority of scholars are of the view that it is prohibited to wear anything that covers the foot, even if it does not cover the ankles, whether it covers all of the toes at the front or covers all of the heels, or covers the top of the foot.\xa0\n\nIn Minah Al-Jalil Sharh Mukhtasar Khalil (2/260) it says: “No sandals should be worn except those that have two straps to tie them to the foot, so that one may walk easily. It is not permissible for him to wear any shoes that have a wide strap going around the heel and a wide strap going over the top of the feet, because that results in covering much of the foot.”\xa0\nAbu Ishaq Ash-Shirani (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Wearing Khufuf that have been cut so that they come lower than the ankle, when sandals are available, is not permissible, and compensation must be offered for that… because it is a garment that is fitted to that part of the body, and it resembles the Khuff (leather slipper).”\xa0 (Al-Muhadhdhab fi Fiqh Al-Imam Ash-Shafa`I, 1/381)\xa0\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“With regard to wearing Khufuf that have been cut to come lower than the ankle, is it permissible to wear them when sandals are available? There are two well-known points of view concerning that which were mentioned by the author and his companions. The correct view, according to their consensus, is that it is prohibited; this is what is implied by the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in the authentic Hadith mentioned above: “Whoever cannot find sandals, let him wear Khufuf, but let him cut them so that they come lower than the ankles.” (Al-Majmu` Sharh Al-Muhadhdhab, 7/258)\xa0\nAl-Mawirdi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Because the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) permitted the wearing of Khufuf that have been cut down, on condition that the individual does not possess any sandals, if that condition is not met, then it cannot be assumed to be permissible.” (Al-Hawi Al-Kabir, 4/97)\xa0\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Wearing cut-down Khufuf, when sandals are available, is an action for which compensation must be paid, and he (the pilgrim in Ihram) does not have the right to wear them. This was stated by Ahmad, and this was also the view of Malik… because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) stipulated, when he said that it was permissible to wear them, that one should not have any sandals. This indicates that (wearing cut-down Khufuf) is not permissible when a person does have sandals. Moreover, they are tailored to fit that part of the body. So the pilgrim in Ihram must give compensation if he wears them (without a valid excuse), as in the case of gloves (if worn by a woman in Ihram).” (Al-Mughni, 5/122)\xa0\nThis view was favoured by Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him), who said:\n“With regard to rubber boots that come below the ankles , some scholars say that there is nothing wrong with that, because the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said, according to the hadith of `Abdullah ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), “Whoever cannot find sandals, let him wear Khufuf, but let him cut them so that they come lower than the ankles.” He said: That is because, if they are cut so that they come lower than the ankles, they become like sandals.\xa0\nBut the apparent meaning of the Sunnah is that the ruling is general, so the correct view is that it is prohibited, and that it is not permissible for the pilgrim in\xa0 Ihram to wear (western-style) shoes, even if they come below the ankles.” (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 22/136)\xa0\nShaykh Muhammad Al-Mukhtar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“It is not permissible for the pilgrim in Ihram to wear shoes that cover his feet or most of his feet; rather he should wear shoes that do not cover most of the foot. If the shoes cover part of the foot, then his toes should be uncovered, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “…let him cut them so that they come lower than the ankles.” Based on that, the toes should be uncovered, and based on that, if the shoe covers the ends of the toes, then it is not permissible to wear it, like the kind of slipper that covers the front of the foot. This should not be worn.” ( Sharh Zad Al-Mustaqni`, 5/135)\nThe Hanafis are of the view that it is permissible to wear something that covers the foot on condition that it does not cover the ankles. So if a person wears a shoe that covers the front of the foot and the heel and the top of the foot, there is nothing wrong with that so long as it does not cover the ankles.\nThey quoted as evidence the fact that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) advised a person who could not find any sandals to wear the Khufuf and cut them so that they came lower than the ankles, which suggests that after cutting it, it has been transformed from a form that is prohibited to a form that is permissible, which indicates that it is permissible to wear anything that comes lower than the ankles.\xa0\nAl-Kasani (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Some of our later shaykhs granted a concession allowing the wearing of shoes, by analogy with the cut-down Khufuf, because it is similar to it.” ( Bada’i` As-Sana’i`, 2/184)\xa0\nAs-Sarkhasi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Based on that, our later shaykhs said: There is nothing wrong with the pilgrim in Ihram wearing that which does not cover the ankle, so it is like sandals.” (Al-Mabsut, 4/127)\xa0\nIn Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah (2/154) it says: “The Malikis, Shafa`is and Hanbalis included with the Khuffayn any footwear that covers part of the feet, so they did not regard it as permissible to wear Khuffayn that are cut to come below the ankle, except in cases where sandals are not available. If sandals are available, then it is not permissible for him to wear them (the cut-down Khuffayn), and he must take them off if he has put them on. But if he has put them on because of an excuse such as illness, then he is not sinning and he does not have to offer compensation.\xa0\nAs for the Hanafis, they said: Anything that does not cover the ankles is permissible for the pilgrim in Ihram to wear.”\xa0\nThis view was favoured by Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him).\xa0\nHe said:\n“The correct view is that it is permissible to wear anything that comes below the ankles, whether sandals are available or not.” (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 26/110)\xa0\nHe said concerning the Hadith, “If he cannot find sandals, let him wear Khufuf , but let him cut them so that they come lower than the ankles”:\n“This indicates that that which has been cut down to be like sandals is permissible to be worn in all cases, and one may wear things that are similar to them, of various kinds of footwear. This is the view of Abu Hanifah and is one of the views narrated from Imam Ahmad and others. My grandfather Abu’l-Barakat (may Allah have mercy on him) used to issue fatwas to this effect towards the end of his life, when he did Hajj.\xa0\nRather the hadith mentions the one who cannot find sandals because cutting the Khufuf when sandals are available is damaging the Khufuf and wasting wealth unnecessarily, which is prohibited. That is different from the case when there are no Khufuf. This has been made an alternative in that case, so as not to waste wealth.” (Al-Fatawa Al-Kubra, 1/327)\xa0\nAnd he said:\n“The words “let him wear Khufuf, but let him cut them so that they come lower than the ankles” clearly indicate what is permissible to wear and what makes it different than the Khufuf, which is disallowed, and makes it like sandals which is permissible. Otherwise there would be no difference between wearing cut-down Khufuf and intact Khufuf. This is a concession granted to the one who cannot find sandals, because of what is mentioned above. Moreover, a concession was granted after that allowing people to wear Khufuf and pants, for one who has no alternative.\xa0\nMoreover, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) only forbade the pilgrim in Ihram to wear Khufuf and he allowed wiping over the Khufuf; the cut-down Khufuf and other types of shoes are not Khufuf and do not come under the same heading as Khufuf, so they are not included in the prohibition just as they are not included in what may be wiped over, especially when forbidding the pilgrim to wear the Khufuf implies that it is permissible for him to wear other things, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was asked about what garments the pilgrim in Ihram may wear, and he said: ““He should not wear such and such…” So so he limited what the pilgrim is forbidden to wear, and whatever he did not mention is permissible.\xa0\nMoreover, if the foot needs to be covered, then that which is required by necessity must inevitably be permitted. Many people cannot walk in sandals, so it is essential that they be granted a concession allowing them to wear other kinds of footwear.” (Sharh `Umdat Al-Qari, 3/46)\xa0\nThis view is also favoured by Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him), who said:\xa0\n“If someone wears Western-style shoes that come below the ankles, that does not matter, because they come under the same heading as sandals according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions, and because the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to the one who could not find any sandals: “let him wear Khufuf, but let him cut them so that they come lower than the ankles.”\xa0\nThis indicates that those that have been cut down come under the same heading as sandals, and many of the scholars regarded as correct the view which says that it is permissible to wear Khufuf without cutting them down if no sandals are available.\xa0\nIn conclusion, that which is cut down is that which is cut so that it comes below the ankle; there is nothing wrong with this. So if a shoe comes below the ankle and does not cover the ankle, then the ruling on it is the same as the ruling on sandals, and there is nothing wrong with that.” (Fatawa Nur `ala Ad-Darb, 17/275)\xa0\nAnd he said:\xa0\n“It is permissible for the pilgrim in Ihram to wear Khufuf that come below the ankles, because they come under the same heading as sandals.” (At-Tahqiq wal Idah, p. 34)\xa0\nAlthough the view of the Hanafis, which was also favoured by Shaykh Al-Islam (may Allah have mercy on him) and other scholars, is strong in terms of evidence and rationality, it is more on the safe side for the Muslim and his worship not to do that, especially since sandals are available and plentiful, unless there is a need for that, such as if he is someone who will be harmed by wearing sandals or he cannot easily walk in them.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/219643/what-shoes-to-wear-for-hajj-and-umrah
209165,What is the ruling on one who does `Umrah and starts Sa`i from Al-Marwah instead of As-Safa?,"['Praise be to Allah.What the one who does Sa`i between As-Safa and Al-Marwah must do is begin with that with which Allah, may He be Exalted, began and with which His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) began. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily! As-Safa and Al-Marwah (two mountains in Makkah) are of the Symbols of Allah. So it is not a sin on him who performs Hajj or `Umrah (pilgrimage) of the House (the Ka`bah at Makkah) to perform the going (Tawaf) between them (As-Safa and Al-Marwah). And whoever does good voluntarily, then verily, Allah is All-Recogniser, All-Knower” [Al-Baqarah 2:158].\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) began his Sa`i with As-Safa, and he said: “I begin with that with which Allah began.” The more correct view is that doing Sa`i in the proper order is obligatory. So the one who begins with Al-Marwah first cannot count his first lap, and he must do another lap.\xa0\nShaykh Muhammad Al-Amin Ash-Shinqiti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“It must be understood that the majority of scholars stipulate that Sa`i must be done in the proper order, which means beginning at As-Safa and ending at Al-Marwah. If he starts at Al-Marwah, that lap is not counted. Among those who stipulated that it must be done in the proper order are: Malik, Ash-Shafi`i and Ahmad, and their companions, and Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Al-Awza`i, Dawud and the majority of the scholars.\xa0\nConflicting views were narrated from Abu Hanifah concerning that:\xa0\nThe author of Tabyin Al-Haqa’iq Sharh Kanz Ad-Daqa’iq, which is a book on the Fiqh of Imam Abu Hanifah (may Allah have mercy on him), said:\n“If a person begins Sa`i from Al-Marwah, the first lap should not be counted, because he has gone against the command.”\xa0\nShaykh Shihab Ad-Din Ahmad Ash-Shalabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said, in his footnote to Tabyin Ad-Daqa’iq:\n“With regard to his words “If a person begins Sa`i from Al-Marwah, the first lap should not be counted”, in Manasik Al-Karmani it says: Doing Sa`i in a certain order is not an essential condition, according to our view; even if he begins at Al-Marwah and comes to As-Safa, that is acceptable and he may count it, but it is disliked because he did not do what is Sunnah. Therefore, it is recommended for him to repeat that lap.\xa0\nAs-Saruji (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Ghayah: There is no basis for what Al-Karmani said:\xa0\nAr-Razi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Ahkam Al-Quran: If he begins with Al-Marwah before As-Safa, that is not to be counted according to the well-known report from our companions. It was narrated from Abu Hanifah that he should repeat that lap, but if he does not do so there is no blame on him. He regarded it as being like failing to follow the proper order of washing the limbs when purifying oneself. End quote.\xa0\nWith regard to As-Saruji’s comment that there is no basis for what Al-Karmani said, that is subject to further discussion. End quote from Ar-Razi.\xa0\nThe evidence quoted by the majority for it being essential to do Sa`i in the proper order is the fact that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did that and said: “I begin with that with which Allah began.” According to a report narrated by An-Nasa’i he said: “Begin with that with which Allah began,” in the form of a command or instruction. Moreover, he said: “Learn from me your rituals of Hajj.” So we must learn from him and follow him with regard to our rituals, and begin with that with which Allah began, and following that which he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did, acting in accordance with the Holy Qur’an.” (Adwa’ Al-Bayan, 5/250-251)\xa0\nThe scholars of the Standing Committee said – in response to a question about someone who began with Al-Marwah instead of As-Safa, and added an eighth lap:\xa0\n“If the matter is as you describe, that you did an eighth lap to complete the seven laps of Sa`i in the correct order, then your Sa`i is valid, because the first lap that you did, beginning at Al-Marwah and ending at As-Safa, is regarded as invalid, as you did not do it in the prescribed manner.” (Shaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn `Abdullah ibn Baz, Shaykh `Abd Ar-Razzaq `Afifi, Shaykh `Abdullah ibn Ghadyan, Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah lil-Buhuth Al-`Ilmiyyah wal-Ifta’, 11/259- 260)\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/209165/what-to-do-if-you-start-sai-from-al-marwah
