249932,Is white alum pure (tahir)?,"['Praise be to Allah.Alum is a strongly astringent substance, which is composed of crystals of aqueous potassium sulfate and aluminium sulfates. It appears in the form of transparent, colourless crystals which are solid.\nWhite alum is used for many purposes, and is used in cosmetics, deodorants and so on. It is also used for medical purposes, such as sterilization of wounds and relieving pain and infections in the gum, and so on.\nAlum is a pure (tahir) substance which it is permissible to use. It is like any other substance for which there is no evidence (in the religious texts) that it is impure or prohibited, because the basic principle is that things are pure and permissible, and cannot be deemed otherwise except on the basis of textual evidence.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: You should understand that in principle all things, regardless their types and characteristics, are permissible for humans and are pure, and it is not prohibited to handle them and touch them. This statement is very general in application and applies to all substances; these are very decisive and clear-cut words of great benefit and immense blessing, and the scholars refer to this principle in many cases and situations.\nThere is a great deal of evidence for that – from what I can call to mind of the religious texts – namely the Book of Allah, the Sunnah of His Messenger, and following the way of the believers which is referred to in the verses (interpretation of the meaning):\n{O you who have believed, obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you}\xa0[An-Nisa’ 4:59]\n{Your ally is none but Allah and [therefore] His Messenger and those who have believed}\xa0[Al-Ma’idah 5:55].\nThen come the methods of analogy, rational thought, and the right way of thinking and understanding.""(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa\xa0 21/535).\nWe have previously discussed this issue in the answer to question no. 231261 .\nThe jurists have stated that the Muslim can buy and sell it and use it for dyeing and the like. All of that is based on the basic ruling that it is pure.\nIt says in al-Muhit al-Burhani (7/83), which is one of the books of the Hanafis: There is nothing wrong with paying in advance [salam transaction] for cotton, linen, copper, iron, lead, brass, alum and so on.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/249932/is-white-alum-pure-tahir
98031,"I want to know the wording of the Tashahhud in prayer, and how to send blessings on the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).","['Praise be to Allah.Importance of learning the rulings of prayer\nThe Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) encouraged us to learn the rulings on prayer and how he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prayed, so that we would follow his example in that. He said: “Pray as you have seen me praying.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 631)\xa0\nBased on this, we must pay attention to learning this.\xa0\nSignificance of multiple versions of Tashahhud\nThe wordings for the Tashahhud and the blessings on the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that have been narrated in reports are many and various. It is best for the Muslim to recite all of them, saying it in one form on one occasion and in another form on another occasion, and so on, so that he will have done all the sunnahs. He should not limit himself only to some of them. But if that is too hard for him, then he should stick to what he is able to do, and there is no sin on him in sha Allah.\xa0\nWhat to say in Tashahhud\nThere follow some of the versions of the Tashahhud and blessings on the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that have been narrated in proven reports from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in the prayer.\n\nIbn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) recited the Tashahhud as follows:\xa0 At-tahiyyatu Lillahi was-salawatu wat-tayyibat, as-salamu `alayka ayyuhan-Nabiyyu wa rahmat-Allahi wa barakatuhu. As-salamu `alayna wa `ala `ibadillah As-salihin. Ash-hadu allaa ilaha illallah wa ash-hadu anna Muhammadan `abduhu wa rasuluhu (All compliments, prayers and pure words are due to Allah. Peace be upon you, O Prophet, and the mercy of Allah and His blessings. Peace be upon us, and on the righteous slaves of Allah. I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allah, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger). (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 6265 and Muslim, 402)\nIbn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) recited the Tashahhud as follows: At-tahiyyatu Lillahi was-salawatu wat-tayyibat, as-salamu `alayka ayyuhan-Nabiyyu wa rahmat-Allahi wa barakatuhu. As-salamu `alayna wa `ala `ibadillah As-salihin.

Peace be upon you, O Prophet, and the mercy of Allah and His blessings. Peace be upon us, and on the righteous slaves of Allah. I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allah alone with no partner or associate, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger). (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 971 and classed as authentic by Al-Albani)\xa0\nThe Tashahhud of `Umar was recited by him on the pulpit in order to teach the people: “At-tahiyyatu Lillahi, az-zakiyatu Lillahi, Al-tayyibatu Lillahi, As-salawatu Lillahi.

I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allah, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger).\xa0(Narrated by Malik, 204 and classed as authentic by Al-Albani)\n\nHow to send blessings on the Prophet in prayer\nAs for the wording of the blessings on the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), it is as follows:\xa0\n“Allahumma salli `ala Muhammad wa `ala ali Muhammad kama sallayta `ala Ibrahim wa `ala ali Ibrahim, innaka hamidun majid. Allahumma barik `ala Muhammad wa `ala ali Muhammad kama barakta `ala Ibrahim wa `ala ali Ibrahim, innaka hamidun majid (O Allah, send prayers upon Muhammad and upon the family of Muhammad, as You sent prayers upon Ibrahim and upon the family of Ibrahim; You are indeed Worthy of Praise, Full of Glory.

472270,"What is the ruling on friends mocking one another by way of joking, meaning that I trade insults with my friend jokingly, when there is no fear of that stirring up enmity?","['Praise be to Allah.Mocking or lampooning means reviling and listing a person’s faults. It is mostly done in poetry, but it may be done in poetry and otherwise. al-Mu‘jam al-Wasit (2/975).\nThere is a clear prohibition on insulting a Muslim. It was narrated from Ibn Mas‘ud (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Trading insults with a Muslim is evildoing and fighting him is disbelief (kufr).” Al-Bukhari (48).\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The Arabic word sabb (reviling) means insulting and saying about the person things that shame him. Reviling someone for no legitimate reason is prohibited, according to the consensus of the ummah, and the one who does that is an evildoer, as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said.""(Sharh an-Nawawi ‘ala Muslim\xa0 2/53).\nIf it so happens that the insult is said by way of joking, that is not allowed either, because such insults are usually wrong and foul-mouthed. In the hadith it is narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: They said: O Messenger of Allah, you joke with us. He said: “I never say anything but that which is true.” At-Tirmidhi (1990); he said: This is as hasan sahih hadith. It was also classed as sahih by al-Albani in as-Silsilah as-Sahihah (1726).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: It is customary for friends to joke, and those jokes include saying rude words. Is this regarded as prohibited?\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) replied: Yes, rude words which include false accusations, cursing and the like, are prohibited, even if they are said by way of joking, because the Muslim has sanctity and it is not permissible to violate that sanctity.""(Fatawa Nur ‘ala ad-Darb by al-‘Uthaymin\xa0 24/2).\nIt makes no difference whether the insult comes in the form of poetry or prose; rather poetry has more impact, because it is easy to memorize and circulate.\nSecondly:\nYour saying that you mock one another jokingly when there is no fear of that stirring up enmity is not correct, because it is well established for people of reason that people are affected by what is said about them, even if they pretend otherwise because it is said as a joke. Rather it is said that what a person cannot say in earnest he will say as a joke. Educationalists and behaviourists have stated that the impact of such words remains in the psyche. Hence Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {And tell My servants to say that which is best} [al-Isra’ 17:53]. This indicates that speaking unkind words is a means by which the Shaytan sows discord among people, whether the words are said in earnest or in jest. Real-life experience tells us how often jokes create grudges, enmity and rancour, so how about if the jokes include insults and mockery?\nHence it is not appropriate for you to mock one another, even if that is by way of joking; rather you should let your joking be by saying good and permissible words. According to the hadith, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The Muslim is the one from whose words and actions the Muslims are safe.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (10).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/472270/what-is-the-ruling-on-insulting-and-mocking-by-way-of-joking
109538,If I travel to another place during Ramadan and my Salat I missed is Qasr; when I come back should I pray full Salat or half.,"['Praise be to Allah.Making up missed prayers when not travelling\nIf a person misses prayers when he is travelling and makes them up when he is at home, he should make them up in shortened form as if he prayed them whilst travelling, according to the more correct opinion, because making up should match the original that was missed . This is the view of the Hanafis and Malikis, and of the Shafa`is in the older madhhab.\xa0(End quote from Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah, 27/281)\xa0\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti` (4/367): “A man reached his city then he remembered that he had not prayed Dhuhr whilst travelling. So he has to pray it with four Rak`ahs, because it is a prayer that became obligatory for him whilst he was not travelling, so he has to offer it in full. And because shortening the prayer is a concession of travel; once he is no longer travelling then he has to offer it in full.\xa0\nThis is our Madhhab (i.e., the Hanbali school of jurisprudence); but the more correct view is different, i.e., if he remembers a prayer that should have been offered whilst travelling when he gets home, he should offer it in the shortened form because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If a person sleeps and misses a prayer or forgets it, let him offer it when he remembers it,” i.e., let him offer it as it should have been offered. This man remembered that he had not prayed Dhuhr when it was two Rak`ahs in his case, so he does not have to offer it in full.”\nFour scenarios of remembering missed prayers\nAnd he said (4/383):\xa0\n“Based on this, there are four possible scenarios with regard to this issue:\xa0\n\nHe remembered a prayer that should have been offered whilst travelling when he was still travelling; so he should offer it in shortened form .\nHe remembered a prayer that should have been offered whilst he was not travelling when he was not travelling; so he should offer it in complete form.\nHe remembered a prayer that should have been offered whilst he was travelling when he was not travelling; he should offer it in shortened form according to the correct opinion.\nHe remembered a prayer that should have been offered whilst he was not travelling when he was travelling; he should offer it in complete form.”\n\nConsequences of delaying or missing prayers\nIt should be noted that prayer is of great importance and that it is not permissible to delay it until after the time it is due except when joining prayers. If a person sleeps or forgets a prayer, then he should pray it when he wakes up or remembers it, and he is not allowed to delay it. Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And when you have completed the prayer, remember Allah standing, sitting, or [lying] on your sides. But when you become secure, re-establish [regular] prayer. Indeed, prayer has been decreed upon the believers a decree of specified times.} [An-Nisa’ 4:103]\n{Maintain with care the [obligatory] prayers and [in particular] the middle [i.e., `Asr] prayer and stand before Allah, devoutly obedient.} [Al-Baqarah 2:238]\n{But there came after them successors [i.e., later generations] who neglected prayer and pursued desires; so they are going to meet evil.} [Maryam 19:59]\nIbn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said concerning the word Ghayy (translated above as “evil”): It is a valley in Hell that is very deep and foul.\xa0\nAnd Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{So woe to those who pray, [But] who are heedless of their prayer [i.e., the hypocrites who are unconcerned if they miss prayers when no one sees them].} [Al-Ma`un 107:4-5]\nAnd when the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was asked: Which deed is dearest to Allah?, he replied: “Prayer offered on time.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 527 and Muslim, 85)\xa0\nAnd he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever gives up `Asr prayer, his (good) deeds are rendered invalid.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 553)\xa0\nAnd he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not associate anything with Allah, even if you are cut and burned. Do not neglect any prescribed prayer deliberately, for whoever neglects it deliberately no longer has the protection of Allah. And do not drink wine, for it is the key to all evil.” (Narrated by Ibn Majah, 4034 and classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah)\xa0\nWe ask Allah to guide us and you and to keep us all steadfast.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/109538/can-you-pray-qasr-after-returning-home
