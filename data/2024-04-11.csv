480155,I invested in a hospital project which is currently in the preliminary stage of construction. I don't expect any profit in the next 5 to 8 years. Do i have to pay zakat on the investment?,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nInvesting in the construction of a hospital means that the building is to be kept and is not for sale, and profit will be generated after the hospital is up and running from what doctors charge for examining patients, selling medicines, doing x-rays and lab tests, and so on, if the hospital is going to provide these services.\nIf that is the case, there is no zakah on the building or devices and equipment, or anything that is bought to be kept and used in the hospital. It says in al-Ma‘ayir ash-Shar‘iyyah regarding zakah:\n1/4 Fixtures and fittings for the purpose of running the business\nFixtures and fittings for the purpose of running a business are not subject to zakah, such as offices of institutions and the equipment in them, and what the company possesses of intangible things, if they are not for the purpose of trading, such as things that the institute makes use of, such as patents, trademarks and software, and movable items that are kept in the building for the purpose of operating the business and are not prepared for sale, such as machine parts, machines and equipment (in industrial settings), even if they are in storage, so long as they are not for sale.\n2/4 Other fixtures that are used to generate income\nThere is no zakah on other fixtures that are used to generate income, such as things that are rented out, so long as they are not for sale. Rather zakah is due on what is left of the income generated by means of them at the end of the zakah year, by adding that accumulated income to other zakatable wealth and paying zakah on the total.""(Al-Ma‘ayir ash-Shar‘iyyah, p. 448).\nSecondly:\nIn this case, zakah is due on three things:\n1. Cash that is used to build the hospital, if one full hijri year has passed and some of it is left. In that case the one who is in charge of the project must give zakah on it. If he does not do that, then each shareholder must estimate his share of that money, and give zakah on it.\n2. What is prepared for sale, such as medicines. Its value should be worked out at the end of the zakah year, and the zakah on trade goods must be given on it. So one quarter of one tenth (2.5%) must be given.\nThe zakah year begins from the time of taking possession of the money with which the medicines and the like, that are to be sold, were purchased, if this money reached the nisab (minimum threshold at which zakah becomes due).\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Mughni (2/504): If someone buys goods to sell with money that reached the minimum threshold, or he sells goods of which the value reached the nisab, the zakah year is not interrupted (rather it continues), because zakah is due on the value of the goods, not on the goods themselves, and their value is their price. Hence the price and the goods come under the same category. End quote.\n3. With regard to income that is generated after the hospital is up and running, such as doctors’ fees and the like, the accounts should be examined at the end of the zakah year, and zakah should be paid at a rate of one quarter of one tenth (2.5%) on the money that is available and debts which are expected to be paid and are not owed by someone who is in financial difficulty or is delaying payment for no reason.\nIn this case, the zakah year begins from when this money was acquired, after the hospital is up and running.\nThirdly:\nIt is permissible for the people in charge of the project to take care of paying zakah, but if they do not do that, each shareholder should pay zakah himself, after finding out his share of the money that is subject to zakah as we have mentioned above.\nIt says in al-Ma‘ayir ash-Shar‘iyyah, p. 88: With regard to investments in shares with the aim of keeping the shares for the purpose of their yields: if it is possible to find out from the company what belongs to each share of wealth that is subject to zakah (cash, trade goods and debts which are expected to be paid), he should give zakah on that.\nIf that is not possible, he should give zakah on whatever zakatable wealth is connected to each share on the basis of estimation. If the company does not have any zakatable wealth, he should give zakah on what remains of the net income at the end of the zakah year.

6084,"The following article was published stating that the prophet’s spirit is omnipresent at all times (may allah bless him & give him peace). below is most of their article and their proofs. is what they say the truth? 
it is the contention and the belief of the ahle sunnat wal jamat that the holy prophet(sallal lahu alaihi wasallam) is : (a). present & seeing at all times , (b). aware and witnessing the creation of allah , (c). able to be present in several places at the same time . 
"" 'o' nabi (communicator of the unseen) we have sent you as a witness."" (s33 v45). 2). ""then how shall it be, when we bring up a witness from each nation (of each prophet) and 'o' beloved messenger we will bring you as a witness and guardian against all those."" (s4 v41)
observe that the holy prophet(sallal lahu alaihi wasallam) is being called a witness to all the nations that allah has put upon this earth. therefore, the holy prophet(sallal lahu alaihi wasallam) must have been present before his earthly appearance and is still present after this earthly demise, otherwise he cannot be called upon as a witness in the true sense of the word. there are many other verses of the holy quran that call upon the holy prophet(sallal lahu alaihi wasallam) to be a witness. and a witness can only be someone who is hazir & nazir.
a technical point: the following quranic verses are often quoted to show that the holy prophet(sallal lahu alaihi wasallam) was not present and seeing before his earthly appearance : ""and you('o' prophet) were not with them(present) when they cast their pens(to decide) which of them should be mary's guardian."" (s3 v44)
""the prophet was not present when musa was called upon tur"" (s28 v46) yes, the holy prophet(sallal lahu alaihi wasallam) was not present (physically speaking) at these .","['Praise be to Allah.The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the best and most perfect of creation, and the most beloved to Allah and the most honoured by Him. But this does not mean that his human characteristics are to be denied , or that any of the duties of worship which are due only to Allah should be directed to him.\xa0\nThe Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was a human being who suffered from sickness and real death the same as any other human being. Allah said (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Verily, you (O Muhammad) will die, and verily, they (too) will die.” [Az-Zumar 39:30]\xa0\n“And We granted not to any human being immortality before you (O Muhammad); then if you die, would they live forever?” [Al-Anbiya’ 21:34]\nThe Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) died and was buried in his grave , hence Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “Whoever used to worship Muhammad, Muhammad has died, but whoever used to worship Allah, Allah is alive and will never die.”\nThe fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was a witness , a bringer of glad tidings and a warner, and that he will be a witness on the Day of Resurrection, does not mean that he is present among all nations, or that he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) will remain alive until the Day of Resurrection, or that he sees and witnesses while he is in his grave. Witnessing does not only mean seeing. Rather he will testify against the nations by means of what Allah tells him, for he does not know the unseen. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“… and If I had the knowledge of the Ghaib (Unseen), I should have secured for myself an abundance of wealth…” [Al-A`raf 7:188]\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) does not have the ability to be present in numerous places; he is in only one place, which is his grave, and this is according to the consensus of the Muslims.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/6084/is-prophet-muhammad-omnipresent
273295,"Who inherits from a man who leaves behind no father, mother, wife or children, but he has nieces who are the daughters of a deceased full brother, and he has nephews and nieces who are the sons and daughters of deceased full sisters, and he has a paternal cousin, and his paternal uncle is also deceased. Is this a case of kalalah?","['Praise be to Allah.This case is a case of kalalah. What is meant by kalalah is when a man dies and does not leave behind parents or children who could inherit from him.""(An-Nihayah fi Gharib al-Hadith wa’l-Athar\xa0 4/197).\nPlease see the answer to question no. 185972 .\nAs there is no heir who would inherit an allocated share of the estate in this case, the entire estate goes to the paternal cousin, because he is the only ‘asib [male relative on the father’s side]. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Give the allocated shares of inheritance to those who are entitled to them, and whatever is left over goes to the closest male relative who has no allocated share.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (6732).\nThis paternal cousin is the closest male relative. As for the daughters of his brother, and the sons and daughters of his sisters, they do not inherit anything, because they come under the heading of dhawi’l-arham (relatives who do not receive any share of the inheritance). According to the view that they may inherit, they only inherit when there are no heirs who are entitled to allocated shares and no male relatives on the father’s side, and this condition is not met in this case, because of the presence of the male relative on the father’s side, namely the son of the paternal uncle.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/273295/if-someone-dies-and-leaves-behind-the-children-of-his-siblings-and-a-paternal-cousin-how-should-the-estate-be-divided
188229,"I want to start reciting the beautiful names of Allah every day, starting this Ramadan. What is the reward that will result from that? What are the best times to do this act of worship?","['Praise be to Allah.The Sunnah tells us that the reward for memorising the names of Allah, may He be Exalted, is admission to Paradise. Al-Bukhari (2736) and Muslim (2677) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has ninety-nine names . Whoever memorises them will enter Paradise.”\xa0\nThe word translated as memorised in this Hadith include the following:\xa0\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Memorising them\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Understanding their meanings\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Acting upon what they imply. So if a person knows that Allah is One, he will not associate anything else with Him; if he knows that He is the Provider, he will not seek provision from anyone else; if he knows that He is the Most Merciful, he will do acts of obedience that are a means of attaining this mercy… And so on\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Calling upon Him by these names, as Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And (all) the Most Beautiful Names belong to Allah , so call on Him by them” [Al-A`raf 7:180]. So one may say for example, “O Most Gracious, have mercy on me; O Oft-Forgiving, forgive me; O Accepter of repentance, accept my repentance” and so on. Thus you will realise that it is not prescribed to merely recite these names without understanding them, acting upon them and calling upon Allah by them.\xa0\nShaykh Muhammad ibn Salih Al-`Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “What is meant by memorising them is not merely writing them on a piece of paper, then repeating them until you have memorised them…” (Majmu` Fatawa wa Rasa’il Ibn `Uthaymin, 1/74)\xa0\nUndoubtedly focusing in Ramadan on reading the Quran is better than focusing on any other kind of Dhikr. We advise you to read a great deal of the Quran and ponder its meanings, whilst not neglecting Du`a, calling upon Allah, may He be Exalted, by His names .\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/188229/benefits-of-reciting-99-names-of-allah-daily
