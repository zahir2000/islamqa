417781,"I have a company that develops computer programs at the request of some special customers. Recently the company has offered only one program, in return for a monthly subscription fee paid by customers. I developed it with money provided by my partner, and my efforts and administration. Because my share of the profits was unfair from the beginning, I want to dissolve the partnership, return the capital and profits to my partner, but continue doing business with the program and customers who are subscribing to it, which I developed with my partner’s money. Is it permissible for me to continue doing this work after ending the partnership? I want to do that, so what is the solution?","['Praise be to Allah.A partnership is a permissible, non-binding contract, according to the majority of scholars. It is permissible to dissolve it even without the consent of the other party, unless the terms stipulate a particular duration, in which case it must continue until the end of that period.\nWith regard to dissolving the partnership that you mentioned, the money must be given back to the owner of the capital, and anything surplus to that of equipment, programs, patents or tradenames, if there are any, should be evaluated and sold to a third party – which is called turning goods into cash – or they may be evaluated and sold to one of you, and the proceeds should be divided according to the proportions agreed upon. One of you is not more entitled than the other to carry on using the program.\nIf you do not sell the program to a third party, it must be evaluated, then one of you can buy it, with mutual consent. If both of you want it, then the solution is to draw lots, then the one whose name is drawn may buy it.\nIt says in al-Ma‘ayir ash-Shar‘iyyah (p. 199): The partnership ends when its duration is over, or it may end before that with the agreement of the partners, or by selling to a third party what is in the possession of the company. The partnership may also be ended with the evaluation and sale of its assets, which is to be regarded as if the existing company was closed down and a new company was started, as the assets that were not sold in a real sense were evaluated, and their value is the capital of the new company. If the partnership is liquidated because the agreed-upon duration came to an end, then the remaining goods should be sold, based on whatever price you can get in the market, and the proceeds may be used to liquidate the company’s business in the following manner:\n\nPaying costs of liquidation.\nPaying off any financial commitments from the assets of the partnership.\nDividing the remaining assets between the partners, according to the percentage of capital invested by each of them. If the assets are not sufficient to return the capital, then they should be divided among them in such a way that the loss of each is commensurate with the capital he invested. End quote.\n\nDrawing lots is prescribed when people are competing for their dues.\nThe great scholar as-Sa‘di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nDrawing lots is to be resorted to when there is ambiguity with regard to rights, or there is competition.\nBased on that, this program that you developed using the partnership funds belongs to both of you, so you should work out the value of that program and the value of any patents, and of all the assets of the company, then you can buy them yourself, or you can sell them as described above.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/417781/they-both-worked-to-make-a-computer-program-then-rented-it-out-who-should-take-the-program-and-the-customers-when-they-dissolve-the-partnership
145437,"I would like to know whether or not it is permissible according to Islam to declare bankruptcy. If I declare bankruptcy, I will still acknowledge that I still have to pay the money that I owe, so to whom should I give back the money when I become able to do that? What advice can you give me in this regard?","['Praise be to Allah.The bankrupt (muflis) is the one who has debts that are greater than the wealth he owns.\nIf the creditors ask the court to establish conservatorship (hajr) and divide among them the wealth that the debtor has, the judge must respond to that.\nShaykh Salih al-Fawzan (may Allah preserve him) said, explaining the rulings on conservatorship and bankruptcy:\n1.\xa0What is meant by conservatorship (hajr) in sharia is preventing a person from disposing of his wealth.\nThe evidence for that in the Qur’an is the verses in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And do not give the weak-minded your property, which Allah has made a means of sustenance for you, but provide for them with it and clothe them and speak to them words of appropriate kindness.\nAnd test the orphans [in their abilities] until they reach marriageable age. Then if you perceive in them sound judgement, release their property to them}\xa0[an-Nisa’ 4:5-6].\nThese two verses indicate that conservatorship should be imposed in the case of one who is weak-minded and the orphan to prevent them having access to their wealth, lest they mishandle it and lose it. The wealth should not be given to such a person until after it is established that he is mature and competent. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) imposed conservatorship on some of the Sahabah for the purpose of ensuring that the debt they owed to people would be paid off.\n2.\xa0Conservatorship (hajr) is of two types:\nThe first type: conservatorship imposed on a person because he owes something to others, such as conservatorship imposed on a bankrupt person because of what he owes to his creditors.\nThe second type: conservatorship imposed on a person because that is in his best interests, lest he squander his wealth or mishandle it, such as conservatorship in the case of a minor, a weak-minded person and one who is insane.\nIn the first case, which is conservatorship imposed on a person because he owes something to others, what is meant in this case is conservatorship imposed on one who is bankrupt. The bankrupt person is one who owes a debt that has now become due, but the wealth that he has is not sufficient to pay it off. He should be prevented from disposing of his wealth, so that he does not harm the creditors.\nAs for the debtor who is in financial difficulty and is not able to pay off anything of his debt, he is not to be asked for it, and he should be given more time, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And if someone is in hardship, then [let there be] postponement until [a time of] ease}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:280].\nAs for the one who is able to pay off his debt, it is not permissible to impose conservatorship on him, because there is no need for that. Rather he should be instructed to pay off his debt when the creditors ask him to do so, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “For a rich man to delay repayment is wrongdoing.” In other words, if one who can afford it is taking too long to pay off his debt, he is wronging the creditors, because he is withholding payment that he is obliged to make to people who are entitled to it. So if he refuses to pay off his debts, he should be imprisoned. Shaykh Taqiy ad-Din Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Whoever is able to pay off his debt but refuses to do so should be forced to pay it off by means of beating and imprisonment. This was stated by the leading scholars among the companions of Malik, Ahmad, ash-Shafa‘i and others. He said: And I do not know of any difference of scholarly opinion concerning that. End quote.\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “For a rich man to delay repayment is wrongdoing, and it is permissible to speak ill of him and punish him.” Narrated by Ahmad, Abu Dawud and others.\nWhat is meant by speaking ill of him is complaining about him, and what is meant by punishing him is detaining him. The one who takes too long to pay off what he owes deserves to be punished by detention or otherwise, and that should be done repeatedly until he pays off what he owes. If he persists in taking too long to pay his debt, then the judge should intervene to sell his property and pay off his debts from the proceeds, because the judge will be playing the role of the one who is refusing to pay. That will also serve the purpose of alleviating harm from the creditors. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There should be neither harm nor reciprocating harm.”\n4.\xa0From the above, it becomes clear that in the case of debt, there are two scenarios:\nThe first scenario: the debt has not yet become due. In this case, the debtor is not to be asked to pay it back until it becomes due, and he does not have to pay it before it becomes due. If the wealth he has is less than what he owes that has not yet become due, then he is not to be subjected to conservatorship because of that, and he is not to be prevented from disposing of his wealth.\nThe second scenario: the debt is now due. In that case, there are two possibilities:\nThe first possibility is that the wealth he has is greater than the debt he owes. In this case, he is not to be subjected to conservatorship regarding his wealth, but he should be instructed to pay off the debt if the creditor asks for it. If he refuses to do that, then he should be detained and punished until he pays off what he owes. If he puts up with detention and punishment, and refuses to pay off the debt, then the judge should intervene to pay off his debt from his wealth, selling whatever he needs to sell in order to do that.\nThe second possibility is that the wealth he has is less than the debt he owes. In this case, he should be subjected to conservatorship and prevented from disposing of his wealth, if he has creditors who ask for that, lest he harm them. That is because of the hadith of Ka‘b ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) imposed conservatorship on Mu‘adh and sold his property. Narrated by ad-Daraqutni and by al-Hakim, who classed it as sahih. Ibn as-Salah said: It is a proven hadith. If he is subjected to conservatorship in this case, then that should be announced and it should be made known to people that conservatorship has been imposed on him, lest they be deceived by him and do business with him, then end up losing their wealth.\n5.\xa0There are five rulings having to do with imposing conservatorship on someone.\nThe first ruling is that the rights of the creditors are connected to his wealth that existed before conservatorship was imposed and to any wealth that he acquired after it was imposed. So the wealth that he acquired later is subject to the conservatorship, just like the wealth that he owned before that. Thus he will have no authority to dispose of the wealth that he acquired after conservatorship was imposed in any way whatsoever. Even the wealth that he acquired before it was imposed cannot be disposed of in any way that harms his creditors.\nImam Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf what he owes of debts is equal to or more than what he has of wealth, then any donation he makes is not valid if he donates it in a way that harms his creditors, regardless of whether the judge has imposed conservatorship on him or not. This is the view of Malik and it is the view favoured by our shaykh – meaning Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him). He said: And it is the correct view, and no other view is appropriate according to the general guidelines of the madhhab. In fact, this is in accordance with the teachings and general guidelines of sharia, because the rights of the creditors are connected to his wealth, therefore the judge has the right to impose conservatorship on him. Were it not for the fact that the creditors’ rights are connected to his wealth, then the judge could not impose conservatorship on him. Therefore he is like one who is terminally ill; allowing this debtor to donate his wealth would mean that the creditors would lose what is rightfully theirs, and sharia cannot approve of such a thing. Rather sharia emphasizes the importance of protecting the rights of those who have rights by all possible means, and bars any means that could lead to the loss of their rights. End quote.\nThe second ruling is that if someone finds his exact wealth with the debtor that he sold to him or loaned to him or rented to him before conservatorship was imposed on him, then he has the right to take it back from the one who is bankrupt, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever finds his own goods with one who has become bankrupt has more right to them [than other creditors].” Agreed upon. The jurists (may Allah have mercy on him) stipulated six conditions in order for the one who finds his property with one who is bankrupt and has had conservatorship imposed on him to take it back:\n\nThe bankrupt person should still be alive in order for him to take his property back from him, because of the report narrated by Abu Dawud, according to which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If [the debtor] has died, then the owner of the goods becomes equal to all other creditors.”\nThe bankrupt person should still owe him the price in full. If the creditor has received anything of its price, he is not entitled to take back the goods.\nThe goods should be fully in the possession of the bankrupt person. If the creditor only finds some of them, he cannot take them back, because he has not found his exact property; rather he has only found some of it.\nThe goods should be in the same condition as when they were sold, and none of their characteristics should have changed.\nThe goods should not be connected to the rights of someone else, such as if the bankrupt person gave them in pledge as collateral, and the like.\nThe goods should not have increased in size, such as growing fat [in the case of livestock].\n\nIf all these conditions are fulfilled, then it is permissible for the owner of the goods to take them away, if it has become known that the one who has them has become bankrupt, because of the hadith quoted above.\nThe third ruling is that the creditors should stop demanding repayment from him after conservatorship is imposed on him, until after it is lifted. So whoever sells something to him or lends something to him during this period should ask him to pay him or return it after the conservatorship is lifted.\nThe fourth ruling is that the judge may sell his property and divide its price commensurate with the size of the debts that are currently due, because this is the purpose of imposing conservatorship on him. Delaying that is wronging the creditors. However, the judge should leave for the bankrupt person whatever he needs of shelter and sustenance, and so on.\nAs for any debt that is not yet due, it does not become due when the person declares bankruptcy, and that does not impact the currently-due debts, because the deferral of time for payment is the right of the bankrupt individual, and that right, like all others, cannot be waived. It remains something that the bankrupt person owes. Then after distributing his wealth to those debtors whose payment is currently due, once he has paid them off and none of those currently-due debts remain, the conservatorship should be lifted automatically, without any need for a judicial ruling, because the reason for it no longer applies. If he still owes anything of the debts that are currently due, then the conservatorship is not to be lifted from him except by a judicial ruling, because the judge is the one who ruled that he was to be subject to conservatorship, so he is the one who should rule that the conservatorship is to be lifted.""(Al-Mulakhkhas al-Fiqhi\xa0 2/89-95).\nIf any debts remain unpaid, then they are still owed by the one who is bankrupt, until Allah, may He be exalted, blesses him with wealth, whereupon he must repay these outstanding debts.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/145437/summary-of-the-rulings-on-conservatorship-and-bankruptcy
289243,"How were children brought up at the time of the Prophet? What were some boy-specific and girl-specific games/activities? Which chores did each child help their parents with (and at what age did they start to help out)? Did all girls remain at home? If not, what jobs did they do outside (like trading, etc.)? Can you describe a typical day in a child’s life?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nFor children who were seven years old at the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), it seems that their day would begin with Fajr prayer, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to enjoin his companions to start teaching their children how to pray when they reached the age of seven years.\nIt was narrated from ‘Amr ibn Shu‘ayb, from his father, that his grandfather said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: Instruct your children to pray when they are seven years old, and smack them if they do not pray when they are ten years old, and separate them in their beds.” Narrated by Abu Dawud (459). Also narrated by Abu Dawud (494) and at-Tirmidhi (407) from Sabrah ibn Ma‘bad. At-Tirmidhi said: The hadith of Sabrah ibn Ma‘bad al-Juhani is a hasan hadith.\nThe Sahabah (May Allah be pleased with him) used to fill their children’s day with four things:\n1.\xa0They would teach them faith and Islam, according to whatever each parent was able to do.\nIt was narrated that Jundub ibn ‘Abdillah said: We were with the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and we were strong boys, so we learnt faith before we learnt the Qur’an. Then we learnt the Qur’an and our faith increased thereby. Narrated by Ibn Maajah (61); classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Sunan Ibn Majah (1/37-38).\nIbn al-Athir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n[The word translated here as strong] may also refer to a boy who is approaching puberty.""(An-Nihayah fi Gharib al-Hadith\xa0 1/380).\nIt was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him): When the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) died, I was ten years old, and I had read al-Muhkam. Narrated by al-Bukhari (5035).\nAl-Muhkam refers to the surahs of al-Mufassal. The surahs of al-Mufassal are those from Qaf or al-Hujurat – according to different scholarly views – to Soorat an-Nas.\nIt was narrated that al-Bara’ ibn ‘Azib (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The first ones to come to us were Mus‘ab ibn ‘Umayr and Ibn Umm Maktum, who taught the people the Qur’an. Then came Bilal, Sa‘d and ‘Ammar ibn Yasir. Then ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab came with twenty of the companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Then the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came, and I never saw the people of Madinah rejoice at anything as much as they rejoiced at the arrival of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Even the slave girls were saying: The Messenger of Allah has come! Before he arrived, I had read {Sabbih isma rabbik al-a‘la (Glorify the name of your Lord, the Most High)} [Surat al-A‘la], along with other surahs of al-Mufassal. Narrated by al-Bukhari (3925).\nAt that time, al-Bara’ was still a child, because he was deemed too young to participate in the battle of Badr.\nWhen a child reached the age of seven, his parents would watch him to make sure that he did all of the five daily prayers, as is mentioned in the hadith quoted above. And perhaps some children also offered voluntary prayers, according to what each of them was able to do.\nIt was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I stayed overnight with my maternal aunt, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) got up to pray at night, so I got up to pray with him. I stood on his left, and he took hold of my head and made me stand on his right. Narrated by al-Bukhari (699).\nPerhaps some of them would fast, in order to get used to it so that it would be easy for them when they grew up.\nIt was narrated that ar-Rubayyi‘ bint Mu‘awwidh said: On the morning of ‘Ashura’, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) sent word to the villages of the Ansar around Madinah, saying: “Whoever started the day not fasting, let him complete the rest of the day (without food), and whoever started the day fasting, let him complete his fast.”\nAfter that, we used to fast on this day, and we would make our children fast too. We would make them toys out of wool, and if one of them cried for food, we would give (that toy) to him until it was time to break the fast. Narrated by al-Bukhari (1960) and Muslim (1136).\nPerhaps some of them also did Hajj.\nIt was narrated that as-Sa’ib ibn Yazid said: I was taken to do Hajj with the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) when I was seven years old. Narrated by al-Bukhari (1858).\n2.\xa0The children would help out their families with whatever they were able to do of day-to-day tasks and service.\nAnas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: When the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came to Madinah, he had no servant. Abu Talhah took me by the hand and brought me to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and said: O Messenger of Allah, Anas is a good boy, let him serve you. I served him whilst travelling and at home, and by Allah he never said to me about something that I had done: Why did you do this like this? Or for something that I had not done: Why did you not do this like this? Narrated by al-Bukhari (2768) and Muslim (2309).\nHis age when he started to serve the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was ten years.\nIt was narrated from Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him) that he was ten years old when the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came to Madinah. [He said:] My mother and aunts used to regularly urge me to serve the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and I served him for ten years. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him died when I was twenty years old. Narrated by al-Bukhari (5166).\n3.\xa0They also had their fair share of play and fun.\nIt was narrated that ‘A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: I used to play with dolls in the house of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). I had friends who would play with me, but when the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came in, they would hide themselves from him, but the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would call them to play with me. Narrated by al-Bukhari (6130) and Muslim (2440).\nAnas said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was one of the best people in attitude. One day he sent me to do an errand for him, and I said: By Allah, I will not go. But in my heart I intended to go and do what the Prophet of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) had told me to do. Then I went out and passed by some boys who were playing in the marketplace. Then the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) caught me on the back of my neck from behind. I looked at him and he was smiling. He said: “O Unays, did you go where I told you to go?” I said: Yes, I am going, O Messenger of Allah.\nWe have not come across any sahih hadith which describe in detail what kind of games they used to play, but what appears to be the case is that they carried on with the games that they had known during the Jahiliyyah that were not prohibited according to Islamic teachings, and the games of strength that were known at the time, such as wrestling with one another, as is indicated by some hadiths.\nDr. Jawad ‘Ali \xa0has spoken in detail about the children’s games that were known to the Arabs at that time, in his book al-Mufassal fi Tarikh al-‘Arab qabl al-Islam, Dar as-Saqi edn., (9/124-126).\nSecondly:\nThe basic principle regarding the women of the Sahabah is that they stayed in their houses, in response to the words of Allah, may He be exalted (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And abide in your houses and do not display yourselves as [was] the display of the former times of ignorance}\xa0[al-Ahzab 33:33].\nThey did not go out except for necessary errands, or for prayer if one of them wanted to attend it, but they did not crowd with men in the streets and marketplaces.\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe words {And abide in your houses} mean: Stay in your houses and do not go out unnecessarily.\nAmong the needs that are recognised in Islamic teachings is praying in the mosque, subject to certain conditions, as the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not prevent the female slaves of Allah from attending the mosques of Allah, but let them go out looking scruffy.” According to one report: “and their houses are better for them.""(Tafsir Ibn Kathir\xa0\xa06/409).\nIt seems, from what is mentioned in the hadiths quoted above about training children to get used to Islamic practices from an early age, that the Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) used to prepare their daughters to adhere to Islamic rulings from a young age, so they taught them to observe the etiquette that would instil shyness and chastity in them, in obedience to the command of Allah (interpretation of the meaning):\n{ O you who have believed, protect yourselves and your families from a Fire whose fuel is people and stones, over which are [appointed] angels, harsh and severe; they do not disobey Allah in what He commands them but do what they are commanded}\xa0[at-Tahrim 66:6].\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/289243/how-children-lived-at-the-time-of-the-prophet-blessings-and-peace-of-allah-be-upon-him
112018,"I have some questions to which I would like to find a satisfactory answer that will help me in my research. Recently it has become common in online discussion boards to use anime images (depicting animate beings). What are the means of combating this phenomena, noting that people are very fond of them and love them, especially young women? What are the possible alternatives?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nNo wise person would doubt the impact that animated cartoons have on children, and it is an impact that becomes more intense because of the attractive way they are presented and because of lack of restraint. The means by which these cartoons are shown are very powerful and exciting, to the extent that there are many adults who are infatuated by them, in addition to the lack of restraint that would prevent children from watching them, such as mature thinking and strong belief. Hence if you asked anyone who watched these cartoons when he was very young, he will be able to tell you a lot about the stories and events as if he can see them with his own eyes now. Think about how much is imprinted on children’s minds of images that promote a particular belief or teach a particular behaviour. Whoever reflects on the true nature of these cartoons [and what they promote] will realise the great danger that they pose to children and even adults.\nThe newspaper al-Jazirah (issue no. 12321, Friday 27 Jumada al-Ula 1427 AH) reported on an academic study undertaken by the researcher Huda al-Ghufays which deals with the impact of cartoons on the child at different stages of his life. Among other things, it says in this paper:\nAn academic study has warned of the dangers of imported cartoons on the faith of Muslim children, because of what they contain of deviant ideas aimed at undermining belief in the minds of young people and has affirmed how important it is to consolidate efforts to reform TV channels and satellite channels, in order to protect our youth from the conspiracy against them, for the matter is no longer hidden.\nThe study indicated that an ideological war has been launched against Islam and its people, aimed primarily at the faith of Muslim children, the foundations of the religion, and belief in Allah, His Books and His Messengers.\nThe study discovered that the time when children start to become attached to media is the age of three for males and the age of five for females. This is the most critical stage in the child’s development and in the formation of his ideas and beliefs.\nThe study shows that a high percentage of mothers are unaware of whether or not cartoons can play a role in instilling sound belief or otherwise in children, as 75% of those who were included in the study were not certain about the impact of cartoons in building the child’s creed (‘aqidah). This is indicative of an urgent need to rethink what children watch, and confirms the serious impact that cartoons have on building the child’s imagination and way of thinking, which leads to developing convictions that have a serious influence on the child’s psyche. Unfortunately, this issue – the issue of the impact that cartoons have on the child’s mind – despite the serious consequences that may result from that, has not been discussed in an appropriate manner which reflects the grievous danger that our children are facing. End quote.\nSecondly:\nThose who are in charge of the Muslim media must fear Allah, may He be exalted, with regard to the children of the Muslims. They must realise that they are taking part, through their media, in the destruction of society and in the spread of immorality, violence and corruption. They were not content only to corrupt young men and women, and adult men and women, with movies, plays and songs; now they have added to their dreadful track record things that will corrupt the beliefs and morals of children by means of what they import from the doomed East or the corrupt West of programs and cartoons for children which play a role in ruining and corrupting them.\nThirdly:\nSome of the means that we advise parents and those in authority to use in order to combat this assault on our children and ward it off are as follows:\n1.\xa0Focus on teaching children to memorise the Book of Allah, may He be exalted, and to make the best use of their youthful energy and willingness to learn for that purpose.\n2.\xa0Teach them to love the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his Companions by teaching them their biography and life stories, choosing age-appropriate books for the children.\n3.\xa0Teaching them something about issues of creed (‘aqidah) in a simple and straightforward manner, such as the oneness of Allah and how to venerate Him, love Him and fear Him, and that He has power over all things, and that He is the Creator and Provider, and other things that are appropriate to their age and intellectual level.\n4.\xa0Teaching them to denounce and hate evil, and teaching the child that he should not watch cartoons in which there is music or girls who are uncovered or crosses. Even if there is any character in the cartoon who drinks or eats without saying Bismillah, he should denounce that, and if he sees anyone stealing or killing, he should denounce that. Teaching him that before he watches anything will be beneficial, by Allah’s leave, because the child may see something shown on TV outside the family home, so he will hasten to turn it off and not watch it. There are interesting stories of children who have been raised in this manner, which have been a means of warding off a great deal of evil.\nSome of the alternatives to these cartoons that we may suggest are as follows:\n1.\xa0Similar cartoons should be produced that comply with Islamic guidelines and are free of evils, and which teach about virtues. There is no reason why they should not be the same cartoons, edited to remove the evils, and with the characters playing their roles using permissible words that do not go against Islamic teachings. The Majd channel did well when it used this method, as it has its own programs of cartoons, as well as beneficial dubbing of famous cartoons. Thus this will combine the aim of fulfilling the child’s desire for entertainment with the aim of teaching him some proper behaviour and good manners.\nShaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\nNow there are some Islamic recordings and cartoons, which say that they are Islamic – meaning that they have produced some movies such as the Conquest of Constantinople, or Peace Journey. Recently there has appeared the Boy of Najran, telling a story that is mentioned in Surat al-Buruj and in the hadith narrated in Sahih Muslim. This is a cartoon which has been produced as an alternative to corrupt cartoons. What is the ruling on that?\nHe replied:\nI think, in sha Allah, that there is nothing wrong with this, because in reality – as you said – it protects children from watching haram things. At the very least, even if we are strict about it, it is less serious than other cartoons, meaning – as we have heard – the type in which they try to shed doubts on faith and belief, and which depict the Almighty – Allah forbid – when He sends down rain, and the like. Whatever the case, I do not think there is anything wrong with them…\nI think that if there is nothing but good in it, then there is nothing wrong with it, in sha Allah. But if they are accompanied by music, then they are not permissible, because music is haram.\nLiqa’at al-Bab al-Maftuh (127/question no. 10).\n2.\xa0Choosing educational programs which combine fun and learning. Such programs are becoming widespread, which incorporate sounds and images, and talk about the sea, animals, and so on. The Majd documentary channel is a very active contributor in this field, and its programs are free of music and women.\nThese cartoons and programs should be in accordance with Islamic guidelines. Sister Huda Ghufays has mentioned this in her research paper, and the al-Jazirah newspaper said, reporting on her research:\nThis study suggests some important guidelines that makers of children’s programs should adhere to and keep in mind, such as avoiding production of programs that create fear and terror in children, because they are at a stage where they are receptive to such things and they will have a great impact on them. That is because the child between the ages of two and five years is afraid of being alone, and he is afraid of fire and animals, and imaginary things such as ghosts and ‘ifrits. Depicting such things could lead to the child growing up with psychological problems.\nPrograms for children should focus on promoting good values and should not show a great deal of weeping and crying, because that only leads to a weak character that is unable to face challenges. Rather they should promote values within a framework of fun, with positive and happy stories and ideas.\nThe study confirms that children’s media should be based on knowledge and professionalism, and it should not be produced by immature people. We should pay attention to this aspect of media production, which is based on knowledge, skills and art. We should not go to extremes in using our imagination, because this will have a great impact on children’s way of conceiving things; rather we should allow that within certain limits.\nThe study confirms that it is essential to analyse the impact of cartoons which claim to be in accordance with Islamic standards, to ensure that the purpose behind these productions is not mere entertainment and creating alternatives. We should be aware of the Islamic alternatives that are produced for children, because it seems that most of what is produced as alternatives focuses on avoiding that which goes against Islamic teachings, but they neglect another important aspect, which is how these movies could help to instil Islamic beliefs, in accordance with a well-prepared plan that is appropriate to the age of the audience. It is essential that specialists in Islamic knowledge should fiercely confront campaigns that are aimed at corrupting the minds and faith of our youth.

This will combine fun with benefits, provided that we choose the right sports clubs and choose good friends for our children to play with.\n4.\xa0Children can also watch some Islamic websites which have some sections for children, showing them useful clips, games or cartoons about the stories of the Prophets and the righteous, and stories of battles and campaigns in Islamic history. The ash-Shabakah al-Islamiyyah website has a special section for children which is very beneficial.\nAs you will notice, we do not deal with children as we deal with adults. So it must be noted that we urge parents to try to satisfy the child’s desire to watch movies and play, but at the same time we should not let things get out of control, lest we find ourselves going against Islamic teachings and so that the child does not become corrupt and accustomed to evil, and cause trouble to us when he grows up. Hence we urge companies and organisations who are able to produce useful content for children with sound and images not to spare any effort in that, for the children are in the greatest need of that, and parents are also in great need of a beneficial and fun alternative to show to their children. We think it is essential to produce something especially for girls, so that our daughters will be raised to be modest and lower their gaze from an early age.\nSister Huda al-Ghufays also referred in her paper to some things that are useful in this regard.\nIn the article in the al-Jazirah newspaper which reports on her research it says:\nWith regard to the negative impact of the media and how to remedy it, the study indicates that we should adopt an educational method aimed at instilling faith, focusing on spiritual well-being and strengthening belief, so as to prevent or reduce these negative impacts. The study listed some of these negative impacts and how to find a solution to them:\n1.\xa0Showing a lot of media interviews with football stars, pop stars, movie stars and other celebrities, focusing on their lives and parties and presenting them as examples for children to follow. The study suggests that parents should make the child aware of the example of the Messenger of Allah and encourage the child to take him as an example to be followed, by presenting the Sirah (biography) of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in a story that the child can connect with.\n2.\xa0The child memorising the names of characters in cartoons, and asking to dress like them. The solution to that is to encourage the child to imitate the way the Prophet and Sahabah, and other historical heroes of the Muslims, lived.\n3.\xa0The child readily accepts ideas that are not in accordance with our beliefs. The solution recommended by the study is to strengthen the child’s spiritual immunity, by teaching him the Book of Allah and encouraging him to spend time studying it, and striving to connect the child to the Qur’an in all aspects of life.\n4.\xa0Undermining the child’s pride in being a Muslim; that is because the child is not raised to love Islam and is not made aware of how great it is to be a Muslim. The solution to this issue is to continually highlight the merits of Islam, making the most of special occasions to do that, and comparing Islam to other religions. We should feel a sense of responsibility, and be sincere and truthful in fulfilling the trust as is required of us.
