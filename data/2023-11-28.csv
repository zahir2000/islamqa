471887,I noticed that many worshippers compete to pray behind the imam in the mosque. Is there any particular virtue in that? Is that virtue only connected to the first row and the right-hand side of the first row?,"['Praise be to Allah.It is narrated that there is a particular virtue in competing to pray in the first row and the next row, and so on, behind the imam.\nAl-Bukhari (615) and Muslim (437) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If the people knew what there is (of reward) in the call and the first row, and they could find no other way than drawing lots, then they would draw lots. If they know what there is (of reward) in coming early to prayer, they would compete for it. If they knew what there is (of reward) in ‘Isha’ and Fajr prayer, they would come to them even if they had to crawl.”\nMuslim (438) narrated from Abu Sa‘id al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) saw some of his companions going towards the back (of the mosque). He said to them: “Come forward and follow me (in the prayer), and let those who are behind you follow you, for people will keep moving to the back until Allah puts them back (from great reward or high status).”\nRegarding the virtue of being close to the imam on Friday in particular, there is a report narrated by Samurah ibn Jundub, according to which the Prophet of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Attend the reminder (the khutbah) and come close to the imam, for if a man continues to distance himself, his admittance to Paradise will be delayed, even if he enters it.” Narrated by Abu Dawud (1108). Shaykh al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Its isnad is sahih. Al-Hakim said: It is sahih according to the conditions of Muslim, and al-Dhahabi agreed with him. End quote from Sahih Sunan Abi Dawud (Gharras edn., 4/271).\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWith regard to Jumu‘ah prayer and other prayers, the people should fill the gaps in the first row, then the next row, and so on, as it was narrated in al-Sahihayn that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Why do you not stand in rows as the angels stand in rows before their Lord?” They said: How do the angels stand in rows before their Lord? He said: “They complete the first rows and leave no gaps in the rows.” So no one should fill gaps in the back rows when there are still gaps in the front rows, and no rows should be formed in the streets and stores when there is still space inside the mosque… Rather if the rows in the mosque have been filled and there is no more space, then they may form rows outside the mosque, and if there are no large gaps between the rows and they form rows in the streets and marketplaces, then their prayer is valid…""(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa\xa023/209-210).\nThe scholars regarded it as recommended (mustahabb) to stand on the right-hand side of the row. Among the evidence they quoted for that is the report narrated by Imam Muslim (709) from al-Bara’, who said: When we prayed behind the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), we liked to be on his right so that his face would turn towards us. And I heard him say: “O Lord, save me from Your punishment on the Day when You resurrect or gather Your slaves.”\nThey also regarded it is recommended to be close to the imam, as is mentioned in the hadith of Abu Mas‘ud, who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to touch our shoulders when we were praying and he would say: “Make the rows straight and do not differ, lest your hearts differ. Let those who are adults and mature in thinking be closest to me, then those who come after them, then those who come after them.” \xa0Narrated by Muslim (432).\nIbn al-Jawzi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: He only enjoined that for three reasons, the first of which is preferring them to be in the first row. Secondly, it was so that they might understand what movement he was doing; and thirdly, because he might need them to remind him if he made an error, or he might need them to take over and lead the prayer if something happened to him. By giving preference to them, this teaches those who have less knowledge to show good manners and keep away from that place. And his words “then those who come after them” refer to those who are lower in status.""(Kashf al-Mushkil\xa0 1/327).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIs the right-hand side best in all cases, meaning the right-hand side of any row, or if the space on the right is far away from the imam, is the left-hand side better if the space is closer to the imam?\nThe answer is: the right-hand side is better if the space is closer to the imam, and the evidence for that is the fact that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not say: Complete the right, then the next right, and so on. Rather he said: “Complete the first row, then the next, and so on.” Hence we say regarding the first and second rows that the first row is better than the second, even if one can stand in line with the imam in the second row, and the space in the first row is at the very end of the row, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) enjoined us to complete the first row, then the next, and so on. As for the right-hand side, he did not say: Complete the right then the next right, and so on. If the right-hand side was better in all cases, he would have said: Complete the right then the next right, and so on. Based on that, we say: If spaces on the right and left are of a similar distance from the imam, then the space on the right-hand side is better. If spaces on the right and the left are equally distant from the imam, then the space on right-hand side is better. But if the space on the right is further away from the imam, then the space on the left-hand side is better, because it is closer to the imam, and being close to the imam is something desirable according to Islamic teachings.""(Liqa’ al-Bab al-Maftuh\xa0 215/10).\nSummary:\nCompeting to be in the first rows and to be close to the imam is something recommended (mustahabb), and the virtue of the first row is greater than that of the second, and the second is better than the third, and so on.\nBeing on the right-hand side of the first row is better than being on the left-hand side of it, but being on the left-hand side of the front row is better than being on the right-hand side of the row behind it. Standing in the back rows when one is able to move forward is blameworthy.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/471887/is-praying-in-the-first-row-is-better-than-praying-in-other-rows
113852,"What is the ruling on making a deposit in an Islamic bank, such as the Faisal Islamic Bank?","['Praise be to Allah.What is a deposit?\nA deposit (Wadi`ah) is something that is left with someone else for safekeeping, without the other person having the authority to dispose of it. This is applicable to the safety deposit boxes that may be found in hotels and elsewhere, and also in some banks.\nWith regard to bank deposits, that is something different, because the bank does not keep the exact money [that you deposit]; rather the bank disposes of it.\nThis is as far as names are concerned.\xa0\nTypes of bank deposits\nWith regard to the rulings, bank deposits are of two types:\n\nThe first type is a non-investment deposit, which is also called a demand deposit account or a current account. How it works is that the customer deposits his money in the bank on the basis that he can withdraw it whenever he wants, without making any profit or gain from the process. There is nothing wrong with this idea, because in a way it is a loan from the customer to the bank. But if the bank is Riba-based, it is not permissible to deposit money in it, because the bank will benefit from this money and use it to support it in its prohibited activities.\n\nHowever, if the customer needs to put his money in the bank for safekeeping, and there is no Islamic bank where he can put his money to keep it safe, then in that case there is nothing wrong with him putting his money in a Riba-based bank .\n\nThe second type is investment deposits, in which the customer puts his money in the bank in return for profits or dividends to be paid at set intervals, as agreed.\n\nForms of investment deposits\nThis type of deposit may take several forms, some of which are permissible and some are prohibited.\n\nOne of the permissible forms is where there is a profit-sharing (Mudharabah) contract between the customer and the bank. In this case, the bank invests the money in permissible projects, in return for a set share of the returns. There are several conditions that are to be met in this case:\n\n\nThe bank should invest the money in permissible enterprises, such as establishing beneficial projects, building houses, and the like. It is not permissible to invest the money in building Riba-based banks or cinemas, or lending with interest to the needy. Based on that, it is essential to know the nature of the investment that the bank will make.\nThere should be no guarantee of the capital. So the bank should not commit to return the capital if the bank incurs loss, so long as there has been no shortcoming on the bank’s part that resulted in the loss.\n\nThat is because, if the capital is guaranteed, then this in reality is a loan contract, and any profit that it brings is regarded as Riba (usury).\n\nThe profit should be defined and agreed upon from the outset, but it should be defined as a percentage of the profit, not of the capital. So one of the two parties should get, for example, one third or one half or 20% of the profits, with the remainder going to the other party. The contract is not valid if the percentages of the profit are not known or defined. The fuqaha’ stated that profit-sharing (mudaarabah) is rendered invalid if the shares of profits are unknown.\n\nProhibited forms of investment\nProhibited forms of investment include the following:\n\nIf the capital is guaranteed, so the customer deposits 100, for example, in order to get interest of 10, along with a guarantee of the one hundred. This is a Riba-based loan, and it is the regular practice in most banks.\n\nIt may be called a deposit, or investment certificates or a savings account , and the returns may be shared periodically, or by drawing lots, as in the case of Class C investment certificates . All of that is prohibited.\xa0\n\nIf the bank invests the money in prohibited projects, such as building cinemas and tourist results, in which evils are widespread and many sins are committed, it is prohibited to invest in this bank in that case, because this comes under the heading of cooperating in sin and transgression.\n\nThis is a brief overview of different types of deposits in banks.\nResolution of Islamic Fiqh Council on bank deposits\nIn a statement of the Islamic Fiqh Council belonging to the OIC (Organization of Islamic Cooperation, formally the Organization of the Islamic Conference) it says the following:\n\nDeposits that may be withdrawn at any time (demand deposit account or current account), whether they are in Islamic banks or Riba-based banks, constitute loans according to the Islamic jurisprudential point of view, as the bank which receives these deposits is entrusted with them (and liable for them), and are required according to Shari`ah to return the money on request.\n\nThe fact that it is a loan is not altered by the fact that the bank is wealthy.\n\nBank deposits may be divided into two types, according to the regular practices of the bank:\n\n\nDeposits on which interest is paid, as is the case in Riba-based banks. These are prohibited Riba-based loans, regardless of whether the type of deposit is a demand deposit account (current account), or a deposit that is made for a set period, or a deposit for which notice must be given for withdrawal, or a savings account.\nDeposits given to banks that are committed to operating in accordance with the rulings of Islamic Shari`ah on the basis of an investment contract, in return for a share of the profit; these deposits are regarded as capital for profit-sharing (Mudharabah) contracts, and are subject to the rulings on profit-sharing (Mudharabah) contracts according to Islamic Fiqh (jurisprudence). These rulings include the impermissibility of the bank guaranteeing the capital (or being liable for it).” (Majallat Majma‘ Al-Fiqh, issue no. 9, part i, p. 931)\n\nIf the Faisal Bank adheres to these guidelines, namely investing the money in permissible projects and not guaranteeing the customer’s capital, and agreeing with the customer on a defined share of the profits, then there is nothing wrong with making investment deposits in this bank, and there is also nothing wrong with opening a current account with it.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/113852/what-types-of-deposits-are-allowed-in-islamic-banks
131561,What is the ruling on what some people do of signing books and writing good wishes to those who ask them to do that?,"['Praise be to Allah.We put this question to Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahman al-Barrak (may Allah preserve him) and he said:\nWhat some authors do of signing copies of the books they have written at the request of the publishers, is a new phenomenon and is undoubtedly a foreign tradition that does not make sense, because the copies that the author is meant to sign are not gifts from the author that he would sign to indicate that. Rather the copy of the book belongs to the one who is requesting the signature, so it does not seem that there is any meaning in that except blind imitation. It is as if the ones who do that are seeking blessing (barakah) from the author writing his name in their copy, and that is very unlikely, unless the author is someone whom the Sufis believe in as they believe in their saints. What appears to be the case is that this is not requested from every author; rather it is requested from those who are famous, so that the one who gets his signature can boast about it, or the author is someone he likes, so he gets that signature for the sake of memory. It is well known that competing in seeking signatures from the author may lead to him developing self-admiration.\nBased on the above, the least we can say is that doing this is makruh, because it is imitating non-Muslims, and because it makes no sense and it may cause the author to develop self-admiration. It may also lead to the one who asks for the signature venerating the author and the copy that he signed. And Allah knows best. End quote.\nMoreover, competition among fans, male and female, to rush to the author to get his or her signature, as happens in book fairs, may also open the door to fitnah and temptation between the sexes.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/131561/ruling-on-asking-authors-to-sign-their-books
245973,"I have a very bad character; I am disobedient and defiant towards my mother and I often make her angry. Sometimes my manners and character are good, but most of the time they are bad. How can I improve my character and my manners? What are the things that will help me to be kind to my parents and develop a good character? Will I be punished if my character and manners are bad? Or is having a good character something that is only good but is not essential? When my character is good, I feel that I am showing off, and I feel that I am committing minor shirk (by showing off). So how can I remain steadfast in having a good character and good manners, whilst being sincere to Allah in that regard?","['Praise be to Allah.Virtue of a good charecter in Islam\nA good character is something that will weigh most heavily in the balance of deeds on the Day of Resurrection, and the best of people in character will be seated closest to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on the Day of Resurrection.\nIt was narrated by At-Tirmidhi (2018) – who classed it as sound – from Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Among the dearest of you to me and those who will be seated closest to me on the Day of Resurrection are those of you who are best in character .” (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Saheeh At-Tirmidhi)\nAl-Bukhari (6035) and Muslim (2321) narrated from ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that he said: “The best of you are the best of you in character.”\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“This is encouragement to have a good character, and it highlights the virtue of such a person, for this is the character of the Prophets of Allah, may He be exalted, and His close friends (Awliya’).”\nAl-Hasan Al-Basri (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“The definition of a good character is doing acts of kindness, refraining from causing harm, and having a cheerful countenance.”\nAl-Qadi ‘Iyad (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“It means mixing with people with a kind and cheerful character, and being friendly and compassionate towards them, putting up with them, showing forbearance and patience towards them at times of hardship, refraining from being arrogant towards them or mistreating them, and avoiding being harsh and angry with them or being critical towards them.”\nIs it a sin to disobey your parents?\nDefiance and disobedience towards parents is a major sin , and the one who is defiantly disobedient towards his parents will not prosper in this world or in the hereafter.\nWhat the Muslim, man or woman, must do is treat his parents very kindly and strive to treat them well in every way possible, and to avoid angering them or going against their wishes and defiantly disobeying them.\nHow to improve your character in Islam\nIt is possible to improve one’s character and refine it, by doing the following:\n\nKnowing the virtues of having a good character and the reward that will result from it in this world and the hereafter.\nKnowing the bad consequences of having a bad character, and what will result from it of requital and negative consequences.\nStudying the biographies of the earlier generations (Salaf) and the lives of the righteous.\nAvoiding getting angry, striving to attain patience, and training oneself to be deliberate and not hasty.\nSitting with people of good character, and avoiding sitting with people of bad character.\nTraining oneself to develop a good character and trying to make oneself become accustomed to that, and being patient when striving to do that.\nFinally: calling upon Allah, may He be Exalted, and asking Him to make your character good and help you to attain that. One of the supplications of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was: “O Allah, You have made my outward appearance good, so make my character good.” Narrated by Ahmad (24392); classed as authentic by the commentators on Al-Musnad. Also classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Al-Jami‘ (1307).\n\nIf a Muslim slips and behaves badly in some situation, he should hasten to apologise and set things straight, and he should resolve to improve his character.\nWhen the Muslim strives to improve his character, doing that in obedience to the command of Allah, may He be exalted, seeking His pleasure and following the example of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), this is like any other act of worship (that is, he should be sincere in his intention and so on). So he should not try to improve his character in order that people might praise him, because this will cancel out the reward and he will be deserving of punishment for showing off.\nJust as the Muslim should strive to make all his worship sincerely for Allah alone, so too he should strive to do the same when trying to improve his character. He should always bear in mind the command of Allah, the reckoning, the balance, and paradise and hell, and he should remember that people will never benefit him or harm him at all. Remembering the hereafter is one of the most important means that will help the Muslim to be sincere to Allah, may He be exalted.\nHow to be dutiful to parents in Islam?\nThings that will help one to treat parents kindly include the following:\n\nKnowing the rights and virtues of parents, and how they brought up their children and put up with hardship in order to give their children a life of ease and joy.\nKnowing the Islamic texts that encourage showing kindness to parents , and the texts that warn against defiantly disobeying them, and understanding the effect that it may have and the punishment for it in this world and the hereafter.\nKnowing that showing kindness to parents is one of the greatest means of ensuring that the one who shows kindness to his parents will have children who will show kindness to him, and that defiantly disobeying parents is one of the greatest means of ensuring that the one who defiantly disobeys his parents will have children who will be defiantly disobedient towards him.\nStudying the biographies of the earlier generations (the Salaf) and learning how they used to honour their fathers and mothers.\nReading books and essays that speak about showing kindness to parents or defiantly disobeying them, and also listening to Islamic lessons that speak about these topics.\nGifting them, saying kind words, being cheerful, offering a great deal of supplication and speaking well to them are among the greatest means that help one to show kindness to parents.\n\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/245973/how-to-improve-your-character-in-islam
