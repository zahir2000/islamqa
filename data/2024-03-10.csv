150534,"If the father appoints a proxy to give his daughter in marriage, what should the proxy say to the groom when doing the marriage contract? If he says, “I give to you in marriage the woman on behalf of whom I am acting as a proxy” out of ignorance, is that valid? What is the correct phrase?","['Praise be to Allah.If the father appoints a proxy to give his daughter in marriage, then this proxy should say words to indicate that he is acting as a proxy of the guardian in this marriage, such as saying “I give to you in marriage So-and-so the daughter of So-and-so, who has appointed me as his proxy to give her in marriage” or, “I give to you in marriage So-and-so the daughter of the one who has appointed me as his proxy,” and similar phrases.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf the guardian has appointed a proxy, what the proxy should not say, for example, is, “I give to you in marriage my daughter.” Rather he should explain that he is a proxy, so he should say, “I give to you in marriage the daughter of So-and-so, who appointed me as his proxy, and she is So-and-so the daughter of So-and-so” or, “I give to you in marriage as a proxy the daughter of So-and-so the son of So-and-so.”\nIf he says: “I give to you in marriage the daughter of So-and-so,” that is not valid, because he has no guardianship over her, unless he explains the reason why he is giving the daughter of So-and-so in marriage, which is because he is his (the guardian’s) proxy.""(Ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘\xa0 12/23).\nShaykh Ibn Jibrin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIt is valid for the groom to appoint a proxy, and for the woman’s guardian to do so. Therefore if the groom is far away, he can send word appointing you as his proxy, and say: “You are my proxy in my marrying the daughter of So-and-so, so you should be present.” And the guardian of the girl may say: “I give my daughter in marriage to So-and-so, who has appointed you as his proxy.” And you may say: “I accept on behalf of So-and-so, who appointed me as his proxy.” That is valid.\nSimilarly, the guardian may appoint you as his proxy, so for example you may say to the groom: “I give to you in marriage the daughter of the one who appointed me as his proxy, So-and-so the daughter of So-and-so,” and he may say, “I accept.”(Sharh Akhsar al-Mukhtasrat).\nAs for the proxy of the guardian saying: “I give to you in marriage the woman on behalf of whom I am acting as a proxy,” this wording is not correct, because the woman has no right to do the marriage contract herself, or to appoint someone to do the marriage contract for her.\nRather her guardian should do the marriage contract for her on the basis of his having guardianship over her, not on the basis that he is acting as a proxy for her.\nBut usually people do not differentiate between these words, and do not pay attention to the difference in meaning or what they indicate.\nTherefore what appears to be the case is that the marriage that was done with these words is valid, on the grounds of the intention of the guardian’s proxy, as he meant that he was the proxy of the guardian, not the proxy of the woman.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/150534/what-should-the-proxy-of-the-womans-guardian-say-when-doing-the-marriage-contract
50404,"A girl noticed some thin discharge on her underwear but she had not felt it come out. Is it permissible for her to pray with her underwear on which this discharge has gotten? If it is not permissible, then does she have to repeat her Wudu and change her underwear?","['Praise be to Allah.The discussion on such discharges focuses on two issues:\xa0\nAre discharges pure or impure?\xa0\nThe view of Abu Hanifah and Ahmad, and one of the two views narrated from Ash-Shafi`i – which An-Nawawi classed as correct – is that it is pure. This view was also favoured by Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin, who said in Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti` (1/392):\xa0\n“If these discharges come as the result of intimacy, then they are pure, because they are not the waste products of eating and drinking, thus they are not urine.\xa0\nThe basic principle is that there is no impurity unless there is evidence that something is impure. Because a man is not obliged to wash his penis if he has intercourse with his wife nor to wash his garment if anything gets onto it; if it were impure then the semen, which is pure, would become impure (through contamination with these discharges).\xa0(See Al-Majmu`, 1/406 and Al-Mughni, 2/88)\xa0\nBased on this, she does not have to wash her underwear or change them if these discharges get on them.\xa0\nIs Wudu invalidated because of discharges or not?\xa0\nThe view of most of the scholars is that this does invalidate Wudu.\xa0This is the view favoured by Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him), who said:\xa0\n“Anyone who attributes to me the view that this does not invalidate Wudu is not correct. It seems that he understood from my words that it is pure and does not invalidate Wudu.” (Majmu` Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin, 11/287)\xa0\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) also said (11/285):\xa0\nWith regard to the belief of some women, that (these discharges) do not invalidate Wudu , I do not know of any basis for that except the view of Ibn Hazm.\xa0\nBut, if a woman experiences this wetness constantly, then she should do Wudu for every prayer after the time for the prayer begins, and it will not matter if this wetness is discharged after that, even if that happens while she is praying.\xa0\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“If the wetness described happens continually , most of the time, then every woman who experiences that must do Wudu for every prayer when the time begins. This is similar to the case of a woman who suffers from Istihadah (irregular vaginal bleeding outside menses) or one who suffers from urinary incontinence . \xa0\nBut if this wetness only happens sometimes, and is not ongoing, then it comes under the same rulings as urine – when it happens it invalidates purity, even during the prayer.” (Majmu` Fatawa Ibn Baz, 10/130) \xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/50404/can-you-pray-with-discharge-on-your-underwear
382518,"If I follow the view of the Hanbalis about it being permissible to wipe over the headcover that is wrapped under the chin, should I be wearing the headcover directly on my head, or is there nothing wrong with that [wearing a headband and the like]? Because I wear a small cloth (kerchief or headband) under it that goes around the head only, and does not go over the ears or under the chin. Is it sufficient to wipe the headscarf only, and not this piece of cloth?","['Praise be to Allah.It is proven that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) wiped over his turban when doing wudu.\nIt was narrated from Ja‘far ibn ‘Amr ibn Umayyah that his father said: I saw the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) wiping over his turban and khuffs. Narrated by al-Bukhari (205).\nIt was narrated by Ka‘b ibn ‘Ujrah, from Bilal, that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) wiped over his khuffs and headcover. Narrated by Muslim (275).\nAl-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhat is meant by the headcover here is the turban, because it covers the head. End quote from Sharh Sahih Muslim (3/174).\nBy analogy with that, it is permissible for a woman to wipe over her headcover, especially that which goes under the chin. Whatever is prescribed for men is, in principle, also prescribed for women.\nMoreover, the reason is the same, which is to alleviate the difficulty of taking it off and putting it back on again. In fact, women’s need to wipe over their headcovers is often more obvious and greater than that of men, as is quite clear.\nAl-Hasan narrated from his mother, from Umm Salamah, that she used to wipe over her headcover.\nNarrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah in al-Musannaf (224).\nFor more information and to see the views of scholars regarding this matter, please see the answer to question no. 148129 .\nSecondly:\nIn order for it to be valid to wipe over the headcover, there is no stipulation that the headcover should rest directly on the head, because there is no text to that effect. Rather it is sufficient for it to cover the head as socks or khuffs cover the feet, and it is permissible to wipe over them even if there is another pair of socks or khuffs under them. This is the view of the majority of scholars.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If he put the outer khuff on before invalidating his wudu, it is permissible to wipe over it in all cases, whether the inner one is intact or has holes. This is the view of al-Hasan ibn Salih, ath-Thawri, al-Awza‘i and ashab al-ra’y. Malik disallowed that in one of the two reports narrated from him, as did ash-Shafa‘i in one of his two views, because usually there is no need to wear the second khuff, so there is no need for a general concession regarding it, as is the case regarding a plaster cast.\nIn our view, however, if the two khuffs together are covering the foot and it is possible to walk in them, then they are like one khuff, even if the inner khuff has holes. His saying that there is no need for it is not correct, for if the land is cold, it is usually not sufficient to wear just one khuff.""(Al-Mughni\xa0 1/364).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/382518/wiping-over-the-headcover-khimar-when-there-is-a-piece-of-cloth-headband-under-it
81931,I hope that you can explain the following to me:,"['Praise be to Allah.Can you kiss your fiancé in Islam?\nA man and his fiancée are not married ; rather she is still a “stranger” (non-Mahram) to him until the marriage contract is completed. Based on this, it is not permissible for him to be alone with her, travel with her, touch her, or kiss her.\xa0\nNo one should take this matter lightly, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If one of you were to be stabbed in the head with a needle of iron, that would be better for him than touching a woman who is not permissible for him.” (Narrated by At-Tabarani from the Hadith of Ma`qil ibn Yasar (may Allah be pleased with him); classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Al-Jami, 5045)\xa0\nConcerning the ruling on touching one’s fiancée or being alone with her, Az-Zayla`i (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “It is not permissible for him to touch her face or hands – even if there is no fear of desire – because she is still prohibited for him and there is no need for that.” (Radd Al-Muhtar `ala Ad-Durr Al-Mukhtar, 5/237).\xa0\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“It is not permissible for a man to be alone with his fiancé because she is still forbidden, and Islam does not allow anything but looking, so she remains forbidden for him. And because if he is alone with her there is no guarantee that something forbidden will not happen. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No man is alone with a woman but the devil is the third one present.” And he should not look at her with pleasure and desire, or in a dubious manner.”\xa0\nThe Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) warned us against being alone with a non-Mahram woman, and said: “No man is alone with a woman but the devil is the third one present.” (Narrated by Ahmad, At-Tirmidhi and Al-Hakim; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Al-Jami`, 2546)\xa0\nIs Ghusl required after kissing a fiancé?\xa0\nWith regard to the greater purification (Ghusl ) being required because of kissing, that is not the case. Rather the greater purification is required if semen is emitted or if intercourse takes place.\xa0\nDoes touching a woman break one’s Wudu?\nWith regard to Wudu\xa0being broken by touching a woman, this has been discussed in question no.\xa02178 .\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/81931/can-you-kiss-your-fiance-in-islam
