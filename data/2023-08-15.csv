20759,Is providing breast milk (mother/wet nurse) to an infant too young to live on solid foods a required duty?,"['Praise be to Allah.Breastfeeding is the right of the child\nIf the infant needs to be breastfed, then breast milk must be provided for him.\xa0\nIt says in al-Mawsu’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (22/239):\xa0\n“There is no difference of opinion among the jurists that it is obligatory to breastfeed an infant so long as he needs that and he is at the age for breastfeeding.\xa0\nBreastfeeding is a proven right of the infant, according to the rulings of the Shari’ah, and must be provided for him by the one whose duty it is to do so. The jurists clearly stated that breastfeeding is the right of the child.\xa0\nThey explained the reason for that as being that breastfeeding for an infant is like maintenance for an adult.\xa0\nWhat they said is true and is indicated by the Quran. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“but the father of the child shall bear the cost of the mother’s food and clothing on a reasonable basis.” [Al-Baqarah 2:233]\nAllah has enjoined upon the father to spend on the woman who nurses his child, because nutrition reaches the child via the nurse through breast milk. So spending on the nurse is in fact spending on him.\n\nIt says in Sharh Muntaha al-Iradat:\xa0\n“The one who is obliged to spend on the infant, whether male or female, is obliged to spend on the child’s nurse, because the child is nourished by the milk produced by the nurse, and that can only happen if she is nourished. So it is obligatory to spend on the nurse because this is in fact spending on the child.” (Al-Mufassal fi Ahkam al-Marah, 9/464)\xa0\nEffects of breastfeeding in establishing the prohibition on marriage\nThe scholars unanimously agree on the effects of breastfeeding in establishing the prohibition on marriage and on making the child the mahram of the woman who breastfeeds him, and making it permissible to look at her and be alone with her, but it does not make it obligatory to spend on the person, or make him an heir or a guardian in cases of marriage.\xa0\nThe reason for this mahram relationship is obvious, because when the infant is nourished by the milk of this woman, his flesh grows on that, so it is as if he is her own child.\xa0\nHence the scholars regarded it as makruh to appoint a disbelieving woman or an immoral woman as a wet-nurse, or a woman who was suffering from a contagious disease, because it may pass to the child.\xa0\nThey regarded it as mustahabb to choose a wet-nurse who was of good character and morals, because breastfeeding changes the child’s nature.\xa0\nIt is better if no one breastfeeds the child but his mother, because that is more beneficial, and that may be obligatory for her if the child will not accept the breast of anyone else.\xa0\nDoctors encourage giving the mother’s milk, especially in the early months.\xa0\nThe wisdom of Allah in creating the nourishment of the child in his mother’s milk has been proven through scientific and medical research.\xa0\nMedical benefits of breastfeeding\xa0\nBreastfeeding brings great benefits. Allah has enjoined breastfeeding in His Book, when He said (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“The mothers shall give suck to their children for two whole years, (that is) for those (parents) who desire to complete the term of suckling.” [Al-Baqarah 2:233]\nSo Allah has stated the child’s right to be breastfed.\xa0\nFourteen hundred years after this verse was revealed, international organizations such as the World Health Organization have issued statement after statement calling on mothers to breastfeed their children, whereas Islam enjoined that fourteen centuries ago.\xa0\nThe benefits of breastfeeding for the child include the following:\xa0\n\nThe mother’s milk is sterile, containing no germs.\xa0\nThe mother’s milk cannot be imitated by any milk prepared from the milk of cows, goats or camels. It is composed in such a way as to meet the child’s needs day after day, from birth until weaning.\xa0\nThe mother’s milk contains sufficient amounts of protein and sugar that suit the infant completely, whereas the proteins in cow’s, goat’s and buffalo’s milk are difficult for the child’s stomach to digest, because they are suited to the offspring of those animals.\xa0\nThe development of children who are breastfed is faster and more complete than that of children who are bottle-fed.\xa0\nThe psychological and emotional bond between the mother and her child.\xa0\nThe mother’s milk contains various elements that are essential to the child’s nourishment, in the right amounts and formats needed by his body, and in a form that is suited to his ability to digest and absorb.\xa0 The nourishing content of the milk is not fixed; it changes day by day according to the child’s needs.\xa0\nThe mother’s milk is kept at a suitable temperature that meets the child’s needs, and can be given to him at any time.\xa0\nBreastfeeding is a natural means of contraception for the mother, and is free of the complications that may accompany use of birth control pills, the coil (IUD) or injections.

434239,,"['Praise be to Allah.It was narrated from Humayd ibn Hilal, from a group of people including Abu’d-Dahma’ and Abu Qatadah, who said: We used to pass by Hishaam ibn ‘Aamir on our way to ‘Imraan ibn Husayn. He said one day: You pass by me to go to some men who did not spend more time with the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) than me and they do not have more knowledge of his hadith than me. I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “Between the creation of Adam and the onset of the Hour there is no creation that has more impact than the Dajjaal. Narrated by Muslim (2946). According to another report narrated by him: “no matter greater than the Dajjaal.”\nAl-Qadi ‘Iyad (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“no matter greater than the Dajjaal” for he will have a great impact and cause a great deal of fitnah, not that he is physically large. This is the correct view, although it may be understood as meaning that he is great or large in physical size.""(Ikmal al-Mu‘allim\xa0 8/504).\nThis does not contradict the hadith of Usamah ibn Zayd (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “I have not left behind me any fitnah (trial) that is more harmful to men than women.”\nIbn Battal (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe hadith of Usamah indicates that the fitnah of women is the greatest fitnah to be feared for people, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) included all fitnahs in his words “I have not left behind me any fitnah (trial) that is more harmful to men than women.” The truth of this hadith is attested to in the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says:\n{Beautified for people is the love of that which they desire - of women and sons …}\xa0[Al ‘Imran 3:14],\nin which women are mentioned before all other desires.\nIt was narrated from one of the Mothers of the Believers that she said: Unfortunately, we were put at the forefront of desires.\nThe trial of women is the greatest of trials because of the great temptation they pose to men. And Allah has told us that in addition to that, some of them (women) are enemies to us, so the believer should seek refuge with Allah, turn to Him and ask Him to save him from their temptation and from their evil.""(Sharh Sahih al-Bukhari\xa0 7/188).\nIt seems that the hadith of Usamah refers to the trials caused by desires with which a believer may constantly be faced in his life and his daily activities, and to which people were subject at the time of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him); they continued after he passed away, and they continued throughout all eras, as people are constantly infatuated with women, wealth, status and so on. The most serious of this type of trials is the fitnah of women.\nAs for the fitnah of the Dajjal, it is not included in this type of trial, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not leave it behind when he died, and it has not happened yet. So it is not the same as the trials of desires; rather it is a trial of confusion. Moreover, the hadith of Usamah speaks of a trial that is unique to men, and is not faced by women, whereas the fitnah of the Dajjal will be a trial that affects everyone.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/434239/which-fitnah-is-greater-the-fitnah-of-the-dajjal-or-the-fitnah-of-women
