78963,What is the ruling on using emojis and drawings in chat rooms [such as icons] or using some real images to explain something?,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly\nThe basic principle regarding making images of animate beings is that it is prohibited, whether they are 3D images, or hand-drawn pictures on paper, fabric, walls or otherwise. This is the view of the majority of scholars. Please see questions no. 34839 , 10668 and 39806 .\nAl-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Riyadh al-Salihin: Chapter on the prohibition of making images of animate beings on rocks, stones, cloth, coins, cushions, pillows and so on; and the prohibition on putting images on walls, ceilings, curtains, turbans, garments and so on; and the command to eliminate such images. End quote.\nBut modern scholars differed regarding photography; some prohibited it and some permitted it. The more correct view is that it is prohibited except in cases of necessity or need. See the answers to questions no. 22660 and 8954 .\nSecondly:\nIt seems that the emojis that are used in chat rooms, such as happy faces and sad faces, do not come under the rulings on images, for two reasons:\nThe first reason is because their features are not distinct; rather they are more like a symbol. In fact some of the scholars are of the view that “if the image is so small that it does not appear clearly to the viewer unless he stares at it, it is not disliked (makruh).”""(Al-Fatawa al-Hindiyyah\xa01/108).\nThe second reason is because there is something missing from the picture’s features without which life cannot be sustained, so there is no chest or stomach, and not even a head in reality. It is no more than a circle for the face, without any hair, nose or ears.\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The image is the head, so if the head is cut off, there is no image.” Narrated by al-Isma‘ili in his Mu‘jam from Ibn ‘Abbas; classed as sahih by al-Albani in al-Silsilah al-Sahihah (1921).\nThe majority of jurists are of the view that if there is cut off from the image that without which life cannot be sustained, then it does not come under the ruling on images. Ibn Qudamah said: If the head of the image is cut off, it is no longer disliked (makruh). Ibn ‘Abbas said: The image is the head, so if the head is cut off, it is no longer an image. That was also narrated from ‘Ikrimah. It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Jibril came to me and said: ‘I came to you yesterday, and nothing prevented me from entering except the fact that there were images at the door, and in the house there was a curtain on which there were images, and there was a dog in the house. So issue instructions that the head of the image at the door be cut off, so that it will look like a tree; and issue instructions that the curtain be made into two cushions that will be stepped on; and issue instructions that the dog be taken out.’” So the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did those things.\nIf there is cut off from the image that without which the naimal could not live after it is gone, such as the chest or stomach, or it is given a head that is separate from its body, then it is not subject to the prohibition, because the image is no longer there after those things are gone, so that is like cutting off its head.\nIf what is missing is something without which it could still survive, such as an eye, hand or foot, then it is an image that comes under the prohibition.\nThe same applies if there is an image of a body without a head, or a head without a body, or it is given a head but the rest of its body is the image of an inanimate object – in that case, it is not included in the prohibition, because that is not the image of an animate being.""(Al-Mughni\xa0 7/216).\nFor more details on this matter, and the views of other scholars, please see Ahkam al-Taswir fi’l-Fiqh al-Islami, p. 234-240.\nThirdly:\nYou should avoid putting real images in chat rooms, even if it is only the image of a face. That is safer and more prudent, especially since the apparent meaning of the hadith which says that the image is the head, for the head is what matters when it comes to images, whether it is connected to the body or detached from it.\nThis was the view of some of the Shafa‘i jurists [see: Ahkam al-Taswir (235)].\nShaykh Muhammad ibn Ibrahim said: Regarding half an image [the upper half], I have no doubt that it is prohibited, even though a few people were of the view that it is not haram. Perhaps it is less serious than a complete image because of this view. As for me, I have no doubt about it, because the face is what is important in any image.""(Fatawa al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibrahim\xa01/165).\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The hadith mentioned is also quoted as evidence to prove that cutting off anything other than the head of the image, such as cutting off the lower half of it and the like, is not sufficient and does not make it permissible to use it. Doing that does not remove what prevents the angels from entering, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) issued orders that the images be torn down and erased, and he stated that they prevent the angels from entering, except when the images are things that may be handled in a disrespectful manner or the head is cut off. So anyone who tries to justify keeping an image in the house other than these two mentioned here must produce evidence from the Book of Allah or the Sunnah of His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Moreover, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him} stated that if the head is cut off an image, what remains will be like a tree. This indicates that what justifies keeping it is when it no longer has the image of an animate being and now resembles an inanimate object. But if the lower part of the image is cut off and the head remains, it does not become like that because the face is still there. Furthermore, in the face there is brilliant creation and an image that is not present in the rest of the body. So it is not permissible to make an analogy with something else for one who understands what Allah and His Messenger meant. Thus it becomes clear for the seeker of truth that depicting the head of an animate being and what is next to it is included in the prohibition, because the sahih hadiths quoted above include that.""(Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baz\xa0 4/212).\nThis real image may be used in bad ways. It should also be noted that what is prohibited is drawing the image or taking a photograph of it. As for merely clicking on it or looking at it, that is not prohibited, unless it is images of women or images that promote immorality and evil.\nMay Allah enable us all to do what He loves and is pleased with.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/78963/using-icons-and-emojis-on-the-internet
145050,"There is no doubt that each individual has his own character that Allah has given to him. Although there are characteristics that are common to all human beings, people vary with regard to the way those characteristics are combined.","['Praise be to Allah.\nAllah, may He be Exalted, created His creation and caused them to vary in characteristics, nature and attitude. This is something real and visible, and these differences are common throughout the world. Even within one family differences may be seen between the children. There is great divine wisdom in that and it is indicative of Allah’s great power.\xa0\n\n\nIt cannot be denied that\xa0 a father will feel more inclined towards the child who has good characteristics, whether physical or in his attitude, or is of a nature to which people are attracted, such as if he is cheerful, easygoing and kind. The fact that a child is male does not necessarily mean that a parent will be inclined towards him; rather we find that many fathers are more attached to their daughters, and so on.\xa0\n\n\nThe father cannot be blamed for such inclinations, but it is not wise to express that in front of the children, because of the negative results that stem from that. But if he has only one child, then he may express all his feelings and no one will blame him for that.\xa0\n\n\nMany parents do not realise that showing preference to the child who is distinguished by good and attractive characteristics may be harmful to that child who is so distinguished. That may lead to making him proud and big headed, or it may lead him to become lazy or idle and rely on others to meet his needs. There is no doubt that such a child will never be of benefit to himself or to his parents or the rest of his family.\xa0\n\n\nThe family in which the parents -- especially the father -- favour one of the children over the others cause many negative consequences, such as the following:\xa0\n\n\nThe other children will be discouraged from succeeding or advancing in both religious and worldly terms\nIt may cause them to suffer psychological or physical illness.\nIt may lead to resentment against the favoured sibling, which may go as far as murder!\n\nParents who favour some of their family over others are playing a role in the break-up and destruction of that family, because that favouritism sows the seeds of enmity, resentment and destructive envy among their children. So those who are less favoured may gang up on the one who is favoured over them, and even against their parents. The one who ponders the story of Yusuf (peace be upon him) and sees what they did to him and his other brother will clearly see that what we are saying is true. Allah, may He be Exalted, has told us the reason why they did that to their brother Yusuf. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“When they said: ‘Truly, Yusuf (Joseph) and his brother (Benjamin) are dearer to our father than we, while we are a strong group. Really, our father is in a plain error.\n‘Kill Yusuf (Joseph) or cast him out to some (other) land, so that the favour of your father may be given to you alone, and after that you will be righteous folk (by intending repentance before committing the sin.)’” [Yusuf 12:8-9]\nThere is no doubt that Ya`qub (peace be upon him) was not mistreating those other sons of his; the only thing that made them do that was his feelings of love towards his son Yusuf (peace be upon him). So how about the case of brothers whose father has wronged them by giving to one of their brothers what he did not give to them?\xa0\n\nOne of the most well-known ways in which parents favour some of their children over others is with regard to gifting, which is something that is forbidden according to the laws of Allah. Among the bad effects that result from this kind of favouritism is that it causes children to be disobedient towards their parents, so that they do not all treat their parents with the same level of respect and kindness. Our Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) drew attention to that and clearly stated that favouritism in giving is wrongdoing and unfair.\xa0\n\nIt was narrated that An-Nu`man ibn Bashir (may Allah be pleased with him) said: My father took me to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: “O Messenger of Allah, bear witness that I have given such and such of my wealth to An-Nu`man.” He said: “Did you give to all your children the same as you have given to An-Nu`man?” He said: “No.” He said: “Let someone else bear witness to that for you.” Then he said: “Would you not like all your children to honour you equally?” He said: “Yes.” He said: “Then no (I will not bear witness).”\xa0\xa0(Narrated by Muslim, 3059)\xa0\nJust as Allah, may He be Exalted, has forbidden this favouritism among children in gifting, He has also forbidden something else, namely making a bequest to any one of them. He has forbidden making a bequest to an heir (one who automatically inherits according to Shari`ah). All these rulings are in the best interests of the family and lay the foundations for family unity, not division. \xa0\n\nThe father should realise that not one of his children is perfect. If he favours one of his children for some reason, if he is fair-minded he will also find that the child has some other, negative, characteristics. The opposite may also be said of those whom he does not favour: many of them may have many positive qualities. A child who is loved for the way he moves and speaks may not be able to help the family by buying groceries from the store, and he may not be good at welcoming and serving guests. Parents should pay attention to that. They should encourage the good characteristics of their children and help them to develop them, and not expect the others to be the same. Each person will be helped to do that for which he was created. One of them may love to work, another may love to seek knowledge; a third may love to deal in trade. Some of them may have characteristics that are not found in others. The wise father tries to develop that and makes them complement one another. If he praises the positive characteristics in one child, he should also praise the positive characteristics in others, so that there will be no destructive envy or resentment among them, by Allah’s leave and with His help.\xa0\n\n\nBy the same token, parents should also beware of scolding children for their mistakes and demanding that one child be like his brother so and so. Rather he should mention to him the good qualities of his relatives or neighbours of the same age, or encourage him to develop good characteristics whilst discouraging bad characteristics, without mentioning anyone [from his siblings] in particular, because comparing him with a sibling who is better than him in this case would generate enmity and resentment between them.\xa0\n\n\nIt is not fair for the father to treat the disobedient one among his children the same as he treats the one who obeys him, otherwise the obedient one will not have any advantages. He has to make it clear that the one who does good -- such as helping his mother in the house or memorising Quran -- will have a reward, whereas the one who behaves badly will be deprived of it or penalised -- according to whatever misdemeanours the children may commit. Of course, we do not mean here that he should give him a gift -- we have explained above that doing that is prohibited; rather we mean that he should praise him by saying good things, or giving him more pocket money, or he can let him play a permissible game for longer than the one who misbehaved, and so on. This is the fairness that we encourage in parents; not treating all of them -- those who behave well and those who behave badly -- in the same manner, otherwise it would be unfair to the one who is obedient.\xa0\n\nThe father has the right to withhold from the one who is stubbornly disobedient the money with which he commits sin; in fact it is obligatory for the father to do that, so that he can prevent his child from doing that which angers his Lord, may He be Exalted.\xa0\nShaykh `Abdullah Al-Jibrin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “I will not bear witness to unfairness,” meaning that if the father was more inclined towards one of them, then he may be called unfair or unjust, but it may be that doing that is permissible if the one whom he favours is righteous and the other one is an evildoer and sinner. If he tries to set him straight and fails, and the child becomes disobedient and defiant towards his parents and disobedient towards Allah, turning away from Him and from worship, and indulging in consuming intoxicants and committing evil deeds and sins, and his parents cannot set him straight --- in that case, there is nothing to stop the parents (treating their children differently). In that case it is permissible for them to overlook the issue of equality and not treat him the same as others. Rather they should be strict in dealing with him, even if they deprive him of their care or spending on him, or they penalise him in a way that will bring him back to the right path, with the help of Allah.” (Durus Ash-Shaykh Ibn Jibrin, 1/23)\xa0\n\nAnother matter we advise parents with is to direct their children’s feelings towards the one among their siblings who deserves compassion and love. For example, one of the children may have a disability, so the parents should direct their children to show compassion and love towards their sibling before themselves. In this way they will ensure that the one who has the disability will be given his share of compassion, and they will ensure that there will be no ill feeling between them and their sibling.\xa0\n\n\nNo matter what the differences in the characters and natures of the children, fairness between them in visible matters is something that is prescribed in Islam. If the father pays the marriage expenses for one of them, he should also do that for each of them who wants to get married. If he pays for the medical treatment of one of them who falls sick, he should do the same for whoever needs treatment. If he contributes to the education of one of them, he should do the same for the others too -- so long as it falls within the category of permissible education. The same may also be said with regard to maintenance and clothing. He should treat all of his children fairly with regard to this matter. But we do not say that it should be the same; rather it should be fair. What we mean by that is that he should give each of them what is sufficient for him. Indeed, some of the Salaf (pious predecessors) were of the view that it is preferred to be fair with children in the matter of kissing them!\xa0\n\nImam Al-Baghawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said, commenting on the Hadith of An-Nu`man ibn Bashir (may Allah be pleased with him) quoted above:\xa0\n“There are many lessons to be learned from this Hadith, such as: it is recommended to treat children equally in gift-giving and in all kinds of kindness, even kisses, whether they are male or female, so that there will not be anything in the heart of the less-favoured one that will keep him from honouring the parents.” (Sharh As-Sunnah, 8/297)\nIt was narrated that Ibrahim An-Nakha`i (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “They regarded it as recommended for a man to treat his children equally even with regard to kissing.” (Musannaf Ibn Abu Shaybah, 11/221)\xa0\nSimilarly, he should not favour any child over another. This does not mean that he should have the same feelings towards all of them, because that is something that the father does not have control over. Rather he has control over being fair towards them in outward matters, as is the case with one who has more than one wife: he is not forbidden to love one of his wives more than another, but at the same time he is enjoined to treat them fairly with regard to that which he has control over, namely being fair with regard to outward matters such as maintenance, spending the night with them, and clothing. \xa0\nWe ask Allah to enable you to do that which pleases Him, and to help you to achieve fairness among your children.\xa0\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 10016 , 279342 , 215167 , 20064 , and 162787 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/145050/is-favouritism-among-ones-children-allowed-in-islam
459184,"My menses stopped three or four years ago, but suddenly, two days ago, I found a dark discharge (like the discharge at the beginning of menses) in the vagina, but it was only inside.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe basic principle is that the blood that comes out of a woman is menstrual blood, even if her menses had stopped for several years, or she has reached the age of fifty or older, because there is no defined age for menopause, according to the more correct scholarly view. Allah has connected the rulings on menses to the presence of adha (“harm”), which refers to the blood, so when there is blood, it is assumed to be menses, unless the bleeding lasts for longer than fifteen days, in which case it becomes istihadah (non-menstrual bleeding).\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And they ask you about menstruation. Say, ""It is harm, so keep away from wives during menstruation. And do not approach them until they are pure. And when they have purified themselves, then come to them from where Allah has ordained for you. Indeed, Allah loves those who are constantly repentant and loves those who purify themselves}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:222].\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: There is no specified age after which women stop menstruating. Rather, even if we assume that a woman sees the usual type of blood coming from the womb after the age of sixty or seventy, it is to be regarded as menses. The menopause mentioned in the verse (interpretation of the meaning) {And those who no longer expect menstruation among your women} [al-Talaq 65:4] is not referring to a particular age. If it was referring to a particular age, then Allah and His Messenger would have explained that. Rather the verse is speaking of a woman who thinks that she will no longer menstruate. Once her menses stops and she no longer expects it to return, then she “no longer expects menstruation,” even if she is forty years old. Then if she spent some time without menses, and the bleeding comes back, then it becomes clear that she had not reached menopause.""(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa\xa019/240).\nSecondly:\nMenstrual blood may be black, red or brown.\nIt was narrated from Fatimah bint Abi Hubaysh that she suffered from istihadah (irregular menstrual bleeding), so the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to her: “When it is menstrual blood, it is dark and recognisable, so when that happens, stop praying…” Narrated by Abu Dawud (286); classed as hasan by al-Albani in Sahih Sunan Abi Dawud.\nAl-Khatib al-Sharbini said: “Its colour” that is, of the strong blood, “is black”, then red, which is weak in comparison to the black blood, and is strong in comparison to the brown. The brown is stronger than the yellow, which is stronger than the brownish colour. That which has an unpleasant smell is stronger than that which has no smell, and that which is viscous is stronger than that which is thin and black.""(Al-Iqna‘\xa0 1/95).\nThirdly:\nIf the blood is inside the vagina, then it is menses, and there is no stipulation that it should come out. The presence of blood inside indicates that something has come out from the womb, which is menses.\nIbn Abi Shaybah narrated in al-Musannaf (1/90) with his isnad that ‘Amrah bint ‘Abd al-Rahman al-Madaniyyah (d. 98 AH) – one of the female jurists of the generation of the Tabi‘in – used to say to the women: If one of you inserts a piece of cloth and it comes out changed, then do not pray until you do not see anything.\nIt says in Matalib Uli al-Nuha (1/166): “Similar to that” – that is, the movement of semen – “is the movement of menstrual blood.” This was stated by Shaykh Taqiy al-Din. This ruling applies when sensing its movement inside the body as when it comes out. So if the woman feels the movement of menstrual blood just before sunset, and she is fasting, then her fast is broken, even if the blood does not come out until after sunset. End quote.\nIbn Hajar al-Haytami (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Blood inside the vagina – which is blood that does not come out when squatting on one’s heels – is menses, if that occurs at the time when menses is due…\nThe ruling concerning menses and the rulings that result from its presence are connected to awareness of the presence of blood in the vagina at the time when it is possible for menses to occur, so that if it is present, that time is deemed to be menses, otherwise it is not…\nMenses comes and goes, so when the blood is present in the vagina, then the rulings on menses come into effect, even if it does not come out.""(Al-Fatawa al-Fiqhiyyah al-Kubra\xa0 1/76).\nBased on that, you did well by not praying when you were menstruating. And your menses continues until you see that you have become pure with the cessation of bleeding, or dryness, or the white discharge, unless the bleeding lasts for more than fifteen days, after which you should do ghusl, pray and act in accordance with the rulings on istihadah.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/459184/her-menses-stopped-years-ago-then-she-saw-dark-blood-is-this-regarded-as-menses

It is essential that these friends should be of good character and righteous, so that they can influence your children and be an example for them in their righteousness and adherence to Islam, and the manner in which they interact with their parents.\nThe Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The likeness of a good companion and a bad companion is that of one who carries musk and one who works the bellows. With the carrier of musk, either he will give you some or you will buy some from him, or you will smell a good scent from him; as for the one who works the bellows, either he will burn your clothes or you will smell a bad scent from him.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhaari, 1995 and Muslim, 2628)\xa0\nMake them feel an attachment to the mosque, by encouraging them to pray and attend classes; you can also make that attractive to them and encourage them by giving them gifts and prizes every time one of them shows some progress in his or her classes.\nIt is also a good idea for you to go with them to the mosque, to encourage them to go there and pray.\xa0\nIf it is not easy for them to go to the mosque because it is far away or the route is not safe, then do not neglect to teach them to pray on time at home. There is a binding instruction (from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) to teach those who reach the age of seven to pray and to make them do it; before this age they may be taught but not by way of making them do it.\xa0\nThe Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Instruct your children to pray when they are seven years old and smack them if they do not do it when they are ten, and separate them in their beds.” (Narrated by Abu Dawood, 495; classed as authentic by Al-Albaani in Sahih Abu Dawud)\nLet them hear the Quran recited in beautiful voices, so that the Quran will be held in high esteem in their hearts.
