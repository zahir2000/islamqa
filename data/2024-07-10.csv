438695,"What is the ruling on using a hosepipe in which some dead mice were found, and the smell still remains after cleaning it?","['Praise be to Allah.If the mice died in the hosepipe, and something came out of them, or any part of them disintegrated, then the hosepipe has become impure (najis). If it is washed with pure water, or liquid other than water – according to the scholarly view that liquids other than water are sufficient to remove impurity – in such a way that there is no trace of the impurity left, such as taste, colour or smell, then it becomes pure (tahir).\nIf it is difficult to remove the smell after washing the hosepipe thoroughly and removing the substance of the impurity, then it is deemed to be pure.\nIs it necessary to remove the smell by using something other than water, such as detergents?\nThere is a difference of scholarly opinion regarding that.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Majmu‘ (2/594): If the smell alone remains and is difficult to remove, such as the smell of wine, the urine of a person affected by birsam [a kind of tumour] and some types of excrement.\nThere are two views, the more sound of which is that it becomes pure…\nIf the colour and the smell remain, then it does not become pure, according to the correct view, but ar-Rafa‘i narrated a different view concerning it.\nThe author of al-Tatimmah said: If the impurity cannot be removed with water only, but it can be removed by using potash and the like, that must be done.\nMoreover, whatever we deem to have been purified in this manner, even if the colour or smell remains, is pure in a real sense. This is the correct view which is held by the majority.\nAnother view is also mentioned in at-Tatimmah, which is that it is still impure, but it may be overlooked, and there is nothing to worry about. End quote.\nAl-Hattab said in Mawahib al-Jalil (1/163), in a comment on the view of Khalil: Once the taste has gone away, it does not matter if any colour or smell remains, if it is difficult to remove them.\nIf the taste remains, then the impurity has not been removed, because the fact that the taste remains indicates that the impurity is still present. Therefore the taste must be removed, even if it is difficult.\nIn other words, the place where the impurity was becomes pure thereby, provided that the taste of the impurity is removed. It is not stipulated that the colour or smell should be removed, if that is too difficult. But if it is not too difficult to remove them, that place does not become pure if either of them remains.\nIf the colour remains, that is more serious than if the smell remains.\nIt says in al-Jawahir: If the taste remains after the substance has disappeared, as seen by the naked eye, then that place is still impure, because the fact that the taste is still there indicates that the impurity is still there.\nThe same ruling applies if the colour or smell remains and it can be removed with water.\nBut if it is difficult to remove it, it may be overlooked, and the place is deemed to be pure.\nHe narrated it in adh-Dhakhirah and added: The smell may also be overlooked in the case of cleaning oneself after relieving oneself (istinja’), if it is too difficult to remove it from the hand or from the place.\nNote…\n-2- What matters with regard to removing it is removing it with water, as may be understood from the words quoted above from al-Jawahir, and it is easy to remove it with water. What may be understood from this is that if it is possible to remove the colour or smell with something other than water, that is not obligatory, and this is indeed the case. Ibn al-‘Arabi and Ibn al-Haajib also said something similar.\nIf it is possible to remove the colour and smell with potash or soap, then what appears to be the case is that it is not obligatory. Ash-Shafa‘i had a different opinion regarding that.\nIn the hadith of Khawlah bint Yasar regarding blood that is difficult to remove it says: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Water is sufficient for you, and it does not matter if its trace remains.” Narrated by Ahmad and Abu Dawud.\nSmell may be regarded as being like colour, when it is difficult to remove either. End quote.\nIt says in Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah (6/210): If you washed the impurity that is on your clothes or body, and removed its substance, then you prayed, your prayer is valid, and so is the prayer of those who prayed behind you. It does not matter if any of its smell remains, so long as the substance of the impurity has disappeared.\nShaykh ‘Abdullah ibn Ghadyan, Shaykh ‘Abd ar-Razzaq ‘Afifi, Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn ‘Abdillah ibn Baz.

108860,"I am a young woman who is about to get married, but I suffer from the problem of having a small chest. Is it permissible for me to use creams that help to enlarge the breasts?","['Praise be to Allah.Ruling on breast implants in Islam\nIf the aim in enlarging the breasts is to increase beauty, that is not permissible, because it is changing the creation of Allah. If the breasts are so small as to cause you embarrassment and distress, then there is nothing wrong with enlarging them in ways that will not cause you harm, such as using creams and so on.\xa0\nTreating that with creams is easier than having surgery which involves anaesthesia or uncovering the `Awrah in the event that there is no specialised female doctor available.\xa0\nThe balance between beautification and removing faults\nWhat we have mentioned about differentiating between beautification and removing faults is the general guideline with regard to cosmetic procedures. Please see the answer to question no.\xa047694 .\xa0\nThere follow some of the comments of scholars on this issue:\xa0\nThe scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas were asked:\xa0\nI am a young man, eighteen years old. Four years ago my breast became prominent and that was accompanied by some pain. After a while, the pain went away, praise be to Allah, but the prominence remained. This prominence of my breast is obvious even under clothing. I asked the specialist about that and he said that this can easily be removed by means of cosmetic surgery . Is it permissible to have this surgery? Please note that this problem causes me embarrassment in front of other people.\xa0\nThey replied:\xa0\n“It is permissible for you to have cosmetic surgery to remove this prominence if it is thought most likely that the surgery will be successful and that the harms will not outweigh or be equal to the benefits.\xa0\nAnd Allah is the Source of strength. May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.” (`Abd Al-`Aziz ibn `Abdullah ibn Baz, `Abd Ar-Razzaq `Afifi, `Abdullah ibn Ghadyan, `Abdullah ibn Qa`ud, Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 25/62)\xa0\nThey were also asked (25/59): one of my colleagues had gotten married, praise be to Allah, but he came to me and said that his wife wants to have cosmetic surgery on her face and breasts, because her nose is large and wide, and she wants to reduce it by means of the easy methods that modern science has developed. Is there any doubt about this surgery or is there any sin involved? Please note that not doing it may lead to psychological distress because this fault appears so prominently on her face.\xa0\nThey replied:\n“If the situation is as described, and there is the hope that the surgery will be successful and will not lead to a greater or equal harm, then it is permissible to do it in order to achieve the desired purpose, otherwise it is not permissible.\xa0\nAnd Allah is the Source of strength. May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.” (`Abd Al-`Aziz ibn `Abdullah ibn Baz, `Abd Ar-Razzaq `Afifi, `Abdullah ibn Ghadyan, `Abdullah ibn Qa`ud)\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about some cosmetic procedures such as straightening the nose, liposuction, breast reduction or enhancement, and so on – what is the ruling on these procedures? What are the guidelines, may Allah bless and reward you and benefit others through you.\xa0\nHe replied:\xa0\n“With regard to the beautification that you mentioned, beautification is of two types. The first type is done to remove faults and the second type is done to increase beauty. The first type – removing faults – is permissible; if a person’s nose is bent, it is permissible for him to have surgery to straighten it, because this is removing a fault. The nose is not normal, rather it is bent, so he wants to straighten it. The same applies to a man who has a squint; this is undoubtedly a fault, so if he wants to have surgery to correct the fault, it is permissible and there is no reason why he should not, because this is removing a fault. If a man’s nose is cut off due to an accident, can he have a prosthetic nose installed?\xa0 An incident of this type occurred at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The nose of one of the Companions was cut off in battle and the man had a nose of silver made, but the silver tarnished and developed an unpleasant smell, so the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) gave him permission to have a nose made of gold, so he did that. Hence we say: is it for beautification or to remove a fault? Removing a fault is permissible. The same applies if the lip is cleft (harelip); it is permissible to join the two sides because this is removing a fault.\xa0\nWith regard to the second type, which is increasing beauty, this is what is not permissible. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed women who file their teeth for beauty, i.e., they file them and make gaps between them for the purpose of beautification. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed that, and he cursed women who put on hair extensions by adding hair to their short hair and so on.\xa0\nIt remains for us to examine whether an operation to enhance or reduce the breast is permissible or not. This is a kind of beautification, unless the woman who has small breasts wants to increase them so that they can hold more milk, i.e., if her breast is too small\xa0 and cannot hold enough milk to satisfy for her child. In that case we may say that there is nothing wrong with it. But for the purpose of beautification it is not permissible. This is the guideline with regard to cosmetic surgery. Cosmetic surgery is of two types: the first is removing faults and there is nothing wrong with that; the second is increasing beauty and that is not permissible.” (Al-Liqa’ Ash-Shahri, 50/8)\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/108860/are-breast-implants-prohibited-in-islam

Then it sells it on another platform where the price of crypto currency is high, and gives me the difference between the two prices. Is this wealth halal?","['Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with using a robot to deal in real currency or crypto currency, meaning that the robot takes care of searching for the lowest price for crypto currency and buys it, then it sells it on the same platform or a different platform when the price is high. That is on condition that the exchange be immediate, meaning that the currency that has been purchased enters the dealer’s account immediately, and the currency that has been sold enters the other party’s account immediately.\nThat is because currencies come under the same ruling as gold and silver. So if one currency is sold for another, it is stipulated that the exchange take place immediately, as is required when gold is sold for silver.\nIt was narrated that ‘Ubadah ibn as-Samit (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “: “Gold for gold, silver for silver, wheat for wheat, barley for barley, dates for dates, salt for salt, like for like, same for same, hand to hand. But if these commodities differ, then sell as you like, as long as it is hand to hand [that is, exchanged immediately].” Narrated by Muslim (1587).\nIt said in a statement of the Islamic Fiqh Council belonging to the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC):\nWith regard to the rulings on paper currencies, they are legal tender by which prices are measured, and they come under the established Islamic rulings on gold and silver with regard to matters such as riba (usury), zakah, payment in advance (salam transaction) and so on.\nEnd quote from Majallat al-Majma‘ (issue no. 3, vol. 3, p. 1650; issue no. 5, vol. 3, p. 1609).\nIn this case, the robot takes the place of the agent with regard to buying, selling and receiving.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/507039/is-trading-in-crypto-currency-by-using-a-robot-valid
146713,"I pray the noon prayer on campus, but my classes start before noon and end after the afternoon prayer is performed, with not enough time between classes, so I pray the noon prayer only without the stressed practices for lack of time. If I arrive at class after the professor, I am not allowed to attend the class. Sometimes, I don't even have enough time to get to the place of prayer, so I pray in a secluded space inside the hall.","['Praise be to Allah.It is prescribed to make up the regular Sunnah prayers (As-sunan Ar-rawatib ) if they are missed because of an excuse such as sleeping, forgetting or being too busy to do them, which led to one not offering them at the proper time.\xa0\nSo they may be made up even at times when prayer is not allowed , according to the correct scholarly opinion. That is because of the report narrated by Al-Bukhari (1233) and Muslim (834) from Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her), according to which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) prayed two Rak`ahs after `Asr; she asked him about that and he said, “Some people from `Abd Al-Qays came to me and distracted me from offering the two Rak`ahs that come after Dhuhr , so these are they.”\xa0\nAnd Ibn Majah (1154) narrated that Qays ibn `Amr said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) saw a man praying two Rak`ahs after Fajr. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Fajr prayer twice?” The man said to him: I did not pray the two Rak`ahs that come before it, so I prayed them (now). And the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not say anything. (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah, 948)\xa0\nAnd At-Tirmidhi (426) narrated from `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that if the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not pray four Rak`ahs before Dhuhr, he would pray them afterwards. (Classed as sound by Al-Al-Albani in Sahih At-Tirmidhi)\xa0\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“The correct view in our opinion is that it is recommended to make up the regular Sunnah prayers . This is the view of Muhammad, Al-Muzani, and Ahmad according to one report. Abu Hanifah, Malik and Abu Yusuf, according to the more well-known report from them, said: ""They should not be made up; our evidence is these authentic Hadiths.” (Al-Majmu`, 4/43)\nAl-Mardawi Al-Hanbali (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“The words “and whoever misses any of these Sunnah prayers , it is prescribed for him to make them up”– this is our madhhab (the madhhab of Imam Ahmad) and is the well-known view according to our companions.” (Al-Insaf, 2/187)\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“If one of the regular Sunnah prayers, such as the Sunnah prayer of Dhuhr, is missed, can it be made up after `Asr? There are two views, both of which were narrated from Ahmad. One of them is that it may not be made up; this is the view of Abu Hanifah and Malik. The other view is that it may be made up. This is the view of Ash-Shafi`i and it is stronger. And Allah knows best.” (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 23/127)\xa0\nBased on the above, if you are not able to offer the regular Sunnah prayers before and after Dhuhr at the proper time, it is prescribed for you to offer them after `Asr.\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Is it permissible to delay the Sunnah prayer that is offered before Dhuhr, as we start Dhuhr prayer, then after approximately one hour we offer the Sunnah prayers that come before and after, because the time allowed for us to pray where we are studying outside the Kingdom is only enough to do Wudu’ and offer the (obligatory) prayer only?\xa0\nHe replied:\xa0\n“If a person delays the Sunnah prayer that should be offered before until after the prayer , if that is because of an excuse then there is nothing wrong with him making it up later on, and it is acceptable. But if he had no excuse, then it is not acceptable. What the questioner has mentioned about the time only being enough to do Wudu’ and offer the obligatory prayer is an excuse; based on that, it is permissible to make up the Sunnah prayer that should come before after the prayer , but in this case one should start with the Sunnah that comes after the obligatory prayer, then make up the Sunnah that comes before.” (Fatawa wa Rasa’il Ibn `Uthaymin, 14/194)\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/146713/making-up-a-missed-dhuhr-sunnah-prayer-after-asr
