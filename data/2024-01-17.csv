218022,"My question has to do with a tradition that is followed here in East Africa and is widespread among the people here. It is celebrating the naming of the newborn, meaning that when a child is born, the people slaughter a sheep or goat, then they cook rice and so on, and offer fizzy drinks, and they serve that to friends and relatives who attend the celebration of the child’s naming. What is the Islamic ruling on this practice? According to my knowledge, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and the Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) did not cook food for the naming of the child, and they did not gather for that purpose.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe Sunnah is to offer the ‘aqiqah for the child on the seventh day, slaughtering two sheep for a boy and one sheep for a girl, because of the report narrated by Abu Dawud (2838) from Samurah ibn Jundub (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Every child is in pledge for his ‘aqiqah, which should be sacrificed for him on the seventh day, and his head should be shaved and he should be given a name.” Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud.\nSecondly:\nThe purpose of the ‘aqiqah is to sacrifice the animal as an act of worship to draw closer to Allah, may He be exalted, and as an act of gratitude for the blessing of being given a child. Whatever you do after that – such as cooking the meat and inviting relatives to eat it, or distributing cooked meat or distributing raw meat, or cooking some of it and distributing some of it raw – all of that is permissible, and there is nothing wrong with it.\nPlease see the answer to question no. 167711 .\nThirdly:\nThe Sunnah with regard to naming the child is that it may be done on the first day or on the seventh day.\nThere is nothing wrong with slaughtering the ‘aqiqah on any day, or naming the child on any day.\nPlease see the answer to question no. 155627 .\nFourthly:\nThere is nothing wrong with celebrating the naming of the child and gathering for that purpose, and offering food and drinks, on the basis that it is a happy occasion, not on the basis that it is Sunnah.\nThe scholars of the Permanent Committee were asked:\nIs it permissible to gather loved ones, neighbours and friends for the naming of the newborn, or is such a celebration regarded as an innovation (bid‘ah) and disbelief (kufr)?\nThey replied: Celebrating the naming of the newborn is not part of the Prophet’s Sunnah, and his companions did not do that at his time. So the one who does that on the grounds that it is an Islamic Sunnah and tradition has introduced something into the religion that is not part of it, and that is regarded as an innovation that is to be rejected, because the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever introduces into this religion of ours anything that is not part of it, it is to be rejected.” Agreed upon. But it does not constitute disbelief (kufr).\nBut in the case of someone who does that by way of expressing joy, or to eat the meat of the ‘aqiqah, and not on the grounds that it is Sunnah, there is nothing wrong with that. It is soundly narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that it is prescribed to slaughter the ‘aqiqah and name the child on the seventh day.""(Fatawa Islamiyyah\xa0 4/490).\nConclusion:\nThe celebration that you mention for the child or for his naming comes under the heading of people’s customs and traditions, which vary from one country to another. There does not seem to be anything wrong with it in principle, for one for whom that is his tradition, or who wants to bring happiness to his family and friends, or to express joy at the blessing that Allah has bestowed upon him.\nThere is nothing wrong with doing the ‘aqiqah on this day and cooking it, or cooking part of it on that day.\nFor more information, please see the answers to questions no. 134163 and 89705 .\nFor information on the rulings on the ‘aqiqah, please see the answers to questions no. 12448 and 60252 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/218022/is-it-permissible-to-celebrate-the-naming-of-the-newborn
9607,What are the attributes of the correct religion?,"[""Praise be to Allah.Are deviant religions and human traditions true or false?\xa0\nEvery member of a faith tradition believes that his community is following the truth. Every follower of a religion believes that his religion is the best religion and the straightest way.\xa0\nWhenever you ask the followers of deviant religions or the followers of man-made traditions about the evidence for their beliefs, they tell you that they found their fathers doing this so they are following in their footsteps, then they tell you stories and reports that have no sound basis and whose texts are not free of faults and discrepancies.\xa0\nThey rely on inherited books of which it is not known who wrote or said them, or in which language they were originally written, or in which land they originated; rather they are a mixture that has been gathered and written in a book that is venerated, then they were passed down from generation to generation with no proper scientific examination of the source of the text or of the text itself.\xa0\nThese unknown books and stories and blind imitation do not provide valid proof with regard to religions and beliefs. Are these deviant religions and human traditions true or false?\xa0\nIt is impossible that they could all be true, because the truth is one; there are not many “truths”. And it is impossible that all these deviant religions and human traditions could have come from Allah and all be true. If they are many, and the truth is one, then which of them is the truth? So there have to be guidelines by which we may recognize the true religion and distinguish it from false religions.\nIf we find that these guidelines apply to a religion, then we will know that it is the truth. If these guidelines or one of them is absent from a religion, then we will know that it is false.\xa0\nHow to distinguish between the true religion and false religions\nThe guidelines by which we distinguish the true religion from false religions:\xa0\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The religion should have come from Allah, revealed through one of the angels to one of His Messengers , to convey it to His slaves, because the true religion is the religion of Allah, and Allah is the One Who will judge mankind and bring them to account on the Day of Resurrection according to the religion which He revealed to them. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Verily, We have sent the Revelation to you (O Muhammad) as We sent the Revelation to Nuh (Noah) and the Prophets after him; We (also) sent the Revelation to Ibrahim (Abraham), Isma’il (Ishmael), Ishaq (Isac), Ya’qub (Jacob), and Al-Asbat [the offspring of the twelve sons of Ya’qub (Jacob)], ‘Isa (Jesus), Ayyoob (Job), Yunus (Jonah), Harun (aron), and Sulayman (Solomon); and to Dawud (David) We gave the Zabur (Psalms)” [An-Nisa’ 4:163]\nAnd Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n\xa0“And We did not send any Messenger before you (O Muhammad) but We revealed to him (saying): La ilaha illa Ana [none has the right to be worshipped but I (Allah)], so worship Me (Alone and none else)” [Al-Anbiya’ 21:25]\xa0\nBased on this, any religion which is introduced by some person who attributes it to himself and not to Allah is undoubtedly a false religion .\xa0\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 It should call for the worship of Allah alone, and forbid Shirk (polytheism or the worship of anything other than Allah). It should also forbid the means that lead to that, because promoting Tawhid (belief in the oneness of Allah) is the basis of the call of all the Prophets and Messengers. Every Prophet said to his people:\xa0\n“Worship Allah! You have no other Ilah (God) but Him” [Al-A’raf 7:73 – interpretation of the meaning]\nBased on this, any religion that includes Shirk and joins others in worship with Him, such as a Prophet, angel or Wali (“saint”) is a false religion, even if its followers attribute it to one of the Prophets.\xa0\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 It should be in accordance with the principles advocated by the Messengers, such as the worship of Allah alone, calling people to His path, and forbidding Shirk, disobedience to parents, unlawful killing and immoral deeds, both hidden and open. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n\xa0“And We did not send any Messenger before you (O Muhammad) but We revealed to him (saying): La ilaha illa Ana [none has the right to be worshipped but I (Allah)], so worship Me (Alone and none else)” [Al-Anbiya’ 21:25]\xa0\n“Say (O Muhammad): Come, I will recite what your Lord has prohibited you from: Join not anything in worship with Him; be good and dutiful to your parents; kill not your children because of poverty — We provide sustenance for you and for them. Come not near to Al-Fawahish (shameful sins and illegal sexual intercourse) whether committed openly or secretly; and kill not anyone whom Allah has forbidden, except for a just cause (according to Islamic law). This He has commanded you that you may understand” [Al-An`am 6:151]\xa0\n“And ask (O Muhammad) those of Our Messengers whom We sent before you: Did We ever appoint alihah (gods) to be worshipped besides the Most Gracious (Allah)?” [Az-Zukhruf 43:45]\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 It should not be self-contradictory, so it should not issue one command that is contradicted by another, or forbid something then allow something very similar for no reason, or forbid something or allow it for some but not for others. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Do they not then consider the Quran carefully? Had it been from other than Allah, they would surely, have found therein many a contradiction” [An-Nisa’ 4:82]\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The religion should guarantee to protect people’s religious commitment, honour, wealth, lives and children through the commands, prohibitions and morals that it prescribes, which protect these five holistic principles.\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The true religion should be a mercy to mankind, freeing them from the wrongs that they do to themselves and to one another, whether those wrongs have to do with violating their rights, giving control of wealth to the few or leaders misleading the masses. Allah says, telling us of the mercy that was contained in the Tawrat which He sent down to Musa (peace be upon him):\xa0\n“And when the anger of Musa (Moses) was calmed down, he took up the Tablets; and in their inscription was guidance and mercy for those who fear their Lord” [Al-A`raf 7:154 – interpretation of the meaning]\nAllah says, telling us how He sent ‘Isa (peace be upon him): \xa0\n“And (We wish) to appoint him as a sign to mankind and a mercy from Us (Allah).” [Maryam 19:21 – interpretation of the meaning]\nAnd Allah says of Salih (peace be upon him):\xa0\n“He said: O my people! Tell me, if I have a clear proof from my Lord, and there has come to me a mercy (Prophethood) from Him.” [Hood 11:63 – interpretation of the meaning]\nAnd He says of the Quran:\xa0\n“And We send down of the Quran that which is a healing and a mercy to those who believe.” [Al-Isra’ 17:82 – interpretation of the meaning]\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 It should include guidance regarding the laws of Allah and should show people what Allah wants, and should tell them where they came from and where they are going. Allah says of the Tawrat:\xa0\n“Verily, We did send down the Tawrat (Torah) [to Musa (Moses)], therein was guidance and light.” [Al-Ma'idah 5:44 – interpretation of the meaning]\nHe says of the Injil:\xa0\n“and We gave him the Injil (Gospel), in which was guidance and light.” [Al-Ma’idah 5:46 – interpretation of the meaning]\nAnd He says of the Quran:\xa0\n“It is He Who has sent His Messenger (Muhammad) with guidance and the religion of truth (Islam).” [Al-Tawbah 9:33 – interpretation of the meaning].\nThe true religion is that which contains guidance concerning the laws of Allah and brings security and peace of mind , so that all whispers of the Shaytan are driven away and all questions are answered, and all confusing matters are cleared up.\xa0\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 It should advocate the best attitudes and actions, such as truthfulness, justice, trustworthiness, modesty, chastity and generosity. And it should forbid bad attitudes and actions, such as disobedience to parents, murder, immoral actions, lying, wrongdoing, oppression, miserliness and promiscuity.\xa0\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 It should bring happiness to those who believe. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Ta-Ha. We have not sent down the Quran unto you (O Muhammad) to cause you distress.” [Ta-Ha 20:1-2]\nIt should be in accordance with the sound natural disposition of man (Al-Fitrah):\xa0\n“Allah’s Fitrah (i.e. Allah’s Islamic Monotheism) with which He has created mankind.” [Al-Rum 30:30 – interpretation of the meaning]\nIt should also be in accordance with sound reason and common sense, because the true religion is the laws of Allah, and sound reason is the creation of Allah , and it is impossible that the law of Allah and the creation of Allah would contradict one another.\xa0\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 It should point towards the truth and warn against falsehood. It should show the way to true guidance and steer people away from misguidance. It should call people to the straight path in which there is no crookedness. Allah tells us that when the jinn heard the Quran, they said to one another:\xa0\n“O our people! Verily, we have heard a Book (this Quran) sent down after Musa (Moses), confirming what came before it, it guides to the truth and to the Straight Path (i.e. Islam)”\n[Al-Ahqaf 46:30 – interpretation of the meaning]\nIt does not call them to that which would cause them misery. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Ta-Ha. We have not sent down the Quran unto you (O Muhammad) to cause you distress” [Ta-Ha 20:1-2]\nAnd it does not enjoin them to do anything that would cause their doom. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And do not kill yourselves (nor kill one another). Surely, Allah is Most Merciful to you.” [An-Nisa’ 4:29]\nIt does not differentiate between its followers on the grounds of race, colour or tribe. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“O mankind! We have created you from a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another. Verily, the most honourable of you with Allah is that (believer) who has At-Taqwa [i.e. he is one of the pious]. Verily, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Aware.” [Al-Hujurat 49:13]\nThe only distinguishing feature for which people may be preferred over others, according to the true religion , is piety or fear of Allah.\xa0\nIn the light of the guidelines by which we may distinguish between the true religion and false religions, supported by that which is said in the Holy Quran, which indicates that these guidelines apply to all the truthful Messengers who were sent from Allah, we may then discuss different types of religions.\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9607/how-to-distinguish-between-true-religion-and-false-religion
120819,"There are few job opportunities in our country, unless you can find someone to help you to get a job, but that is in return for payment. Is this haram?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThere is nothing wrong with someone intervening to help you to get a permissible job, so long as his intervention does not deprive someone who is more qualified and more deserving of being appointed to that job, because he has more experience and is more able to do it, or because he applied before you, then they put you ahead of him. Therefore, if that results in someone who is more qualified being deprived of the job, then his intervening is haram, and it is not permissible for you to ask him for help. We have explained the ruling on such intervention in the answer to question no. 26801 .\nWith regard to giving money to the one who intervenes, that is subject to further discussion:\nIf he is going to put some effort into looking for a job for you and tell you about job opportunities, then it is permissible to give him something in return for his efforts, as is the case with employment agencies.\nBut if it will not require any effort on his part, and he is simply going to use his status and position, then this is what the jurists call the price of status or the price for using his status and respectable position. This is a matter concerning which the scholars differed. Some of them are of the view that it is permissible, as may be understood from the words of the Shafa‘is and Hanbalis. Others disallow it, or regard it as disliked (makruh), or say that the ruling depends on the circumstances. And these views are reflected in the Maliki madhhab.\nIt says in ar-Rawd al-Murbi‘, in the chapter on loans: If he says: “Get a loan of one hundred for me, and you will have ten,” that is valid, because it is in return for using his position and status. End quote.\nThere is an example of that in Mughni al-Muhtaj (3/53).\nIt says in al-Insaf (5/134): If he agrees to pay him something for getting him a loan using his position and status, it is valid, because it is in return for using his position and status. End quote.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Imam Ahmad said: If he says: “Get me a loan of one hundred from So-and-so, and you will have ten,” there is nothing wrong with that. But if he says: “Act as my guarantor [for a loan from] that person, and you will have one thousand,” that is not permissible.\nThat is because saying, “Get me a loan and you will have ten” is a payment for doing something permissible, so it is permissible, such as if he were to say: “Build me this wall, and you will have ten.” As for acting as a guarantor, the guarantor is committed to paying off the debt, and if he pays it off, then the one for whom he acted as guarantor will now owe it to him, so the guarantee will have become like a loan, and if he accepts payment, that loan will now be bringing a benefit, so it is not permissible.""(Al-Mughni\xa04/214).\nSecondly:\nIf he has the right to a job or anything else, but he cannot get it except by paying a bribe, it is permissible for him to do that, as we have explained in the answer to question no. 72268 .\nWe ask Allah to help us and you to obey Him and please Him.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/120819/middleman-charging-a-fee-in-return-for-intervening-on-the-basis-of-his-status
317610,"Is prayer valid if one did not wash Madhiy (pre-seminal fluid) from the testicles? I heard that the Shafi `is, Malikis, Hanafis and some of the Hanbalis do not think that we need to wash the testicles.","['Praise be to Allah.How to clean Madhiy\nMadhiy is something impure from which we must purify ourselves.\nIbn `Abd Al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“The regular, well-known substance of Madhiy is a matter concerning which there is consensus and no difference of opinion among the Muslims that it is obligatory to do Wudu because of it, and it is obligatory to wash it off because it is impure."" (At-Tamhid (21/207)\nSo if Madhiy is emitted and any of it gets onto the body, it is obligatory to wash the place it got onto. If someone prays knowing that there is any Madhiy on his body and he deliberately did not wash it, then his prayer is not valid .\nFor the ruling on prayer offered when the body or clothes are not pure, please see the answers to questions no.\xa012720 and\xa0195117 .\nWhat to do if Madhiy gets into the testicles\xa0\nIf the Madhiy gets onto the testicles, then they must be washed in order to remove this impurity, as stated above.\nBut if the Madhiy did not get onto them, and it did not go beyond the place where it was emitted, then in this case there is a difference of opinion among the scholars: is it sufficient to wash only the area of the penis where it was emitted, or must the entire penis, along with the testicles, be washed?\nThe view of Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) is that both the penis and the testicles must be washed.\nAl-Mirdawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Based on the view that it is impure, the penis and testicles must be washed if it is emitted, according to the correct view."" (Al-Insaf c2/328-329)\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) quoted as evidence for that the report narrated in Al-Bukhari and Muslim from `Ali (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) enjoined washing the private part; the apparent meaning indicates that what is meant is the entire private part. In books other than Al-Bukhari and Muslim – such as Musnad Ahmad etc. – it is narrated that it is enjoined to wash the testicles.\n`Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I was a man who emitted a great deal of Madhiy, so I told a man to ask the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) about that, because of the position of his daughter. He said: “Do Wudu and wash your private part.” (Al-Bukhari, 269 and Muslim, 303)\nThe apparent meaning of the word is that the entire private part is to be washed; however, the majority of scholars said that what is meant by “private part” here is the place where the Madhiy is emitted, and not the entire private part. They supported that by comparing it to all other types of impurities; in all other cases it is only required to wash the place where the impurity is.\nIbn Daqiq Al-`Id (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“The scholars differed as to whether he should wash the entire private part, or only the place where the impurity is. The majority are of the view that washing may be limited to the place where the impurity is…"" (Ihkam Al-Ahkam\xa0 1/74)\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“What is required is to wash only the place where the impurity is. This is our view and the view of the majority."" (Al-Majmu` 2/144)\nIbn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“The scholars differed concerning what is meant by the command to wash the private part in the case of Madhiy. Does it mean to wash only the area of the private part where the Madhiy got onto it – as is the case with urine – or to wash the entire private part?\nThere are two views concerning that, both of which were narrated from Malik and Imam Ahmad."" (Fath Al-Bari\xa0 1/304)\nIbn Daqiq Al-`Id (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“The majority of scholars chose not to interpret the word “private part” as referring to the entire area; rather they focused on the context, as what makes washing obligatory is the emission of the substance, which dictates that one may limit washing to the place from which it was emitted and the place it got to [on the body or clothes]."" (Ihkam Al-Ahkam 1/74)\nAbu Ja`far At-Tahhawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“In support of the view that only the place of emission and the place it got to [on the body or clothes] is to be washed, we may say by analogy that the emission of Madhiy is an emission of something that invalidates Wudu; as in the case of urination and defecation, all that is required is to wash the place from which it was emitted and the place it got to [on the body or clothes], and there is no need to wash any more than that, unless one wants to do Wudu and pray. The same applies with regard to bleeding from any part of the body, according to the view of those scholars who regard bleeding as invalidating Wudu.\nThis is the way in which the emission of Madhiy should be dealt with, since it is something that invalidates Wudu; it does not require any washing apart from washing it from wherever it got on the body, apart from washing in order to purify oneself for prayer (Wudu). Thus this argument is further supported by reasoning.\nThis is the view of Abu Hanifah, Abu Yusuf, and Muhammad ibn Al-Hasan (may Allah have mercy on them)."" (Sharh Ma`ani Al-Athar\xa0 1/48)\nThose who say that it is impure responded to that by noting that there is nothing to prevent suggesting that washing more than the place where it is emitted is required. There is a similar case to that in Islamic teaching, which is that it is obligatory to wash the entire body when Maniy is emitted . They also mentioned a benefit of that, which is that washing the penis and testicles stops the emission of Madhiy.\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“And because it is emitted as a result of desire, therefore it is reasonable to suggest that it is obligatory to wash more than the place where it is emitted, as in the case of Maniy . That is because the testicles are its vessel, so washing them will put a stop to it."" (Sharh Al-`Umdah 1/103)\nIt was narrated by Imam Ahmad in Al-Musnad (2/293), and by Abu Dawud (208), from Hisham ibn `Urwah, from `Urwah, that `Ali ibn Abu Talib said to Al-Miqdad (may Allah be pleased with them) … and he mentioned a similar report and said: So Al-Miqdad asked the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and he said: “Let him wash his penis and testicles.”\nIbn Hajar said in At-Talkhis Al-Tahbir (1/117):\n“It was narrated by Abu Dawud via `Urwah from `Ali, and in it it says: “Let him wash his testicles and his penis.” `Urwah did not hear [directly] from `Ali, but Abu `Awanah narrated in his Sahih from `Ubaydah from `Ali with this additional text, and there is nothing wrong with its Isnad [chain of narration].”\nAs-San`ani said in Subul As-Salam (1/199):\n“As it is authentic, there is no reason not to accept the ruling based on it.”\nAbu Dawud (211) narrated from Al-`Ala\xa0ibn Al-Harith, from Haram ibn Hakim, from his paternal uncle `Abdullah ibn Sa`d Al-Ansari (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: I asked the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) about what necessitates Ghusl and about water [i.e., fluid] that is emitted [successively] after water. He (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “That [fluid] is Madhiy, and every male emits Madhiy. So wash it from your private part and your testicles, then do Wudu\xa0as for prayer.” (1/207). (Classed as authentic by Shaykh Al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) in Sahih Sunan Abu Dawud, 1/381)\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“What is required in the case of Madhiy is to wash the penis and testicles."" (Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 17/58)\nThe scholars of the Permanent Committee for Ifta\xa0said:\n“… With regard to Madhiy, it is impure. If you emit Madhiy, you must wash the penis from its base, and the testicles, and sprinkle water over whatever parts of the clothes and body the Madhiy got onto, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed `Ali to wash his penis and testicles and do Wudu in the case of Madhiy, and he instructed him to sprinkle water over whatever of it got onto his clothes.\nAnd Allah is the source of strength. May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and Companions.” (Permanent Committee for Academic Research and Ifta- `Abdullah ibn Qa`ud, `Abdullah ibn Ghadyyan, `Abd Ar-Razzaq `Afifi, `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn `Abdullah ibn Baz.""(Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Daimah 5/382)\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\nWhat is the correct view with regard to washing the penis and testicles when Madhiy is emitted?\nHe replied:\n“The correct view is that it is obligatory, and there is a medical benefit in doing that, which is that washing the penis and testicles stops the emission of Madhiy ."" (Ta`liqat Ash-Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin `Ala Al-Kafi)\nSo the correct view is that it is obligatory to wash the penis and testicles when Madhiy is emitted, because of the soundness of the Hadith which enjoins that.\nWith regard to the validity of prayer , with regard to such matters which are subject to Ijtihad, there is no blame on the one who follows one of the two scholarly views, so long as he believes that it is the correct view, or he is following a scholar whose view it is.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/317610/how-to-clean-madhiy
