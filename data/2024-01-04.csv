473586,Do children see the angels or the jinn?,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nSeeing the angels, in a form other than their true form in which Allah created them, is possible. It is proven that a number of the Sahabah saw the angels in human form, as was also proven among nations who came before us.\nAs for seeing the angels in their real form, there is no report regarding that except reports which say that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) saw Jibril [in his real form] twice, and he was stunned by what he saw of his great size in his real form.\nIt was narrated that ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Whilst we were with the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) one day, a man came to us whose garment was exceedingly white and whose hair was exceedingly black, and there were no signs of travel on him, and none of us knew who he was. He came and sat before the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), resting his knees against his and placing his hands on his thighs. He said: O Muhammad, tell me about Islam…. And the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “O ‘Umar, do you know who that questioner was?” I said: Allah and His Messenger know best. He said: “That was Jibril, who came to you to teach you your religion.” Muslim (8).\nIt was narrated that Sa‘d ibn Abi Waqqas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: On the day of Uhud, I saw on the right of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and on his left two men wearing white garments, fighting fiercely to defend him, and I never saw them before or since. Muslim (2306). These two men were angels.\nAl-Suyuti (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Al-Nawawi said: From this hadith, we understand that seeing the angels is not only for the prophets; rather the Sahabah and the awliya’ (close friends of Allah) have seen them, and they did not fight only on the day of Badr.""(Sharh al-Suyuti ‘ala Muslim\xa05/317).\nAnother example is Jibril (peace be upon him) appearing to Maryam (peace be upon her), and the hadith about the angel who appeared to the bald man, the leper and the blind man, and other sound texts.\nOn our website we have previously given a detailed answer regarding this topic. Please see question no. 96661 .\nSecondly:\nSeeing the jinn – also in a form other than their real form – is also possible. Examples of that include the following:\nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) appointed me to guard the Ramadan zakah. Someone came and started taking some of the food. I grabbed hold of him and said, ‘I am going to take you to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)!’ He said, ‘Let me be, for I am in need and I have children and am in great need.’ So I let him go. … At the end of the hadith it says: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘He indeed told you the truth, although he is a liar. Do you know who you have been speaking with for the past three nights, O Abu Hurayrah?’ I said, ‘No.’ He said, ‘That was a shaytan (a devil).’” Muslim (2187).\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: What we learn from this hadith… is that the Shaytan may appear in different forms, so it is possible to see him. The words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning), {Indeed, he sees you, he and his tribe, from where you do not see them} [al-A‘raf 7:27] refer to when he is in his original form with which he was created.""(Fath al-Bari by Ibn Hajar\xa0 4/489).\nThus we know that seeing the angels and the jinn in a form other than their real form is possible and does happen.\nAs for suggesting that only children can see that, we do not know of any text which speaks of that. This is a matter of the unseen, and we cannot say anything about it except on the basis of evidence, and there is no evidence to deny or affirm that.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/473586/do-nursing-infants-see-the-angels-and-the-jinn
307722,"We know that there are situations in which we should ask permission to enter inside and outside the house, but could you give us more details on these situations, such as when entering the kitchen or living room, or entering the house? Because my students have asked me these questions. And is it permissible to praise other people?","[""Praise be to Allah.Why Seek permission before entering someone’s house?\nAllah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0“O you who have believed, do not enter houses other than your own houses until you ascertain welcome and greet their inhabitants. That is best for you; perhaps you will be reminded” [An-Nur 24:27].\nShaykh As-Sa`di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Here Allah instructs His believing slaves not to enter houses other than their own without asking permission , because that leads to a number of bad consequences, including that to which the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) referred when he said: “Asking permission has only been prescribed so that one will not see that which is not appropriate for him to see.” Because not following this ruling properly may lead to one’s gaze falling upon private things inside other people’s houses. A person’s house, by covering what is private inside its walls, is like a garment that covers what is private of his body.\nEntering other people’s houses without permission may create suspicion about the one who enters them, and he may be accused of evil deeds such as stealing and so on, because entering houses surreptitiously is suggestive of evil intent. Allah forbids the believers to enter houses other than their own until they seek permission; the word used in the original Arabic suggests that seeking permission creates a sense of assurance, whereas entering without permission may cause alarm.\n“and greet their inhabitants” – the manner in which this is to be done is mentioned in the Hadith: “As-salaamu `alaykum (peace be upon you); may I come in?”\n“That” namely seeking permission to enter “is best for you; perhaps you will be reminded”, because it will serve many interests, and because it is part of the noble characteristics that are required of the Muslim. If he is given permission, then he may enter.” (Tafsir As-Sa`di\xa0(565)\nWhen to seek permission to enter someone's house?\nAs for the details of situations in which one should ask permission to enter, in\xa0Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah Al-Kuwaitiyyah\xa0(3/145 ff), this matter is discussed in detail; we may sum it up and make it clearer by noting the following points:\n\nIf someone wants to enter a house, that house is either his house or it is not his house. If it is his house, it is either empty, and no one else lives there except him; or his wife is in it on her own; or she has one of his Mahrams with her, such as his sister, daughter, mother and so on.\n\nIf the house is his house, and no one else is living in it, then he may enter without asking anyone for permission , because permission is his, and asking oneself for permission is a kind of foolishness; Islamic teaching is far above such nonsense.\n\nIf his wife is in the house and no one else is with her, then he does not have to ask permission to enter, because it is permissible for him to see all of her body. However, it is recommended for him to ask permission to enter by clearing his throat, stamping his feet so that his shoes make noise and the like, because she may be in a situation in which she does not want her husband to see her.\nIf one of his Mahrams is in the house– such as his mother, sister and so on – whom he is not allowed to see naked, then it is not permissible for him to enter without asking permission. Details of that are mentioned in some scenarios.\nIf the house is not his house, and he wants to enter it, then he must ask permission, and it is not permissible for him to enter before permission is given to him, according to scholarly consensus, whether the door of the house is open or closed.\n\nExceptions to the obligation to ask permission to enter houses in general include the following:\n\nEntering non-residential buildings [such as shops and the like], if that serves a useful purpose. It is permissible to enter them without asking permission, based on the fact that there is general permission to enter them. There are some differences of opinion regarding the details of the definition of such buildings.\nEntering a house in order to save a life or some property, when asking permission and waiting for permission could result in loss of life or property.\n\n\nThe basic principle is that it is not permissible for a person to dispose of or use the property of someone else, or dispose of something belonging to someone else, except with permission from the Lawgiver or from the owner of the property. In that case, it is not a transgression. So it is not permissible to eat someone else’s food except with the permission of its owner, or in the case of necessity, and it is not permissible to live in someone else’s house except with his permission.\nOne who is in a subordinate position asking permission to enter the space of one who is in a position of authority. This is a matter that depends on custom, meaning that if it is known that the teacher, for example, does not allow the students to enter the classroom without permission, then they must ask permission to enter, because positions of authority are given to protect common interests, and seeking permission to enter from the one in authority, in the place in which he has authority, is something that is very important, so that things may be managed properly and chaos may be avoided. This matter is broad in scope.\nA guest should ask permission before leaving his host’s house.\nIf someone wants to sit down between two men, he should ask them for permission first.\nIf someone wants to look in a book in which there is something that is private belonging to someone else, he must ask him for permission before looking.\n\nWhen is seeking permission to enter someone's house waived?\nThe requirement to ask permission may be waived for several reasons, including the following:\n\nWhen it is not possible to give permission:\n\nThe requirement to ask permission may be waived when it is not possible to give permission for some reason, such as if the one who could give permission has died, or he is travelling far away, or he has been detained and prevented from meeting anyone, and something needs to be done that cannot be delayed until he returns from his travel, or is released from detention, and the like.\n\nWarding off harm:\n\nThe requirement to ask permission is waived if asking permission could result in harm. Therefore it is permissible to sell items that may otherwise be damaged or ruined, that have been left with someone for safekeeping, without asking permission of their owners. And it is permissible to enter a house without asking permission, if doing so will prevent a crime from occurring.\n\nAttaining some right that cannot be attained by asking for permission.\n\nThe requirement to ask permission is waived for the one who has a right, if asking for permission will cause his right to be lost. So it is permissible for a woman to take from her husband’s wealth whatever is sufficient for her and her children, on a reasonable basis, without asking permission, if he refuses to spend on her maintenance, for example.\nIs praising someone permissible in Islam?\nWith regard to praising other people, which means speaking highly of someone for some good that he did, or for some good characteristics that he possesses, that is permissible.\nSo if you say, “I praised So-and-so,” it means that you commended him for his good qualities.\nIn the Hadith it says: “He does not thank Allah who does not thank people.” (Narrated by Ahmad, 7939)\nThe kind of praise that it is not permissible to direct to anyone other than Allah is praising in an absolute sense.\nFor more information, please see the answers to questions no.\xa0146025 \xa0and\xa089945 \xa0.\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/307722/when-to-seek-permission-to-enter-someones-house
396695,"Title insurance protects you from problems with an ownership title when you buy real estate. ... These may be problems that existed before the purchase, such as:","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nInsurance is of two types:\nCommercial insurance, where the aim of the one who buys insurance is to get money, and the aim of the insurance company is to make a profit. This is what is usually the case with insurance as it exists at present.\nThis type of insurance is haram, because it is based on ambiguity, riba (interest or usury) and gambling.\nThe second type of insurance is cooperative insurance, which is based on donations and cooperation between the participants, and it is not aimed at making a profit. This type of insurance is permissible.\nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 8889 .\nWe have not come across the type of title insurance mentioned or what it involves, so that we could give a ruling concerning it.\nHowever, in general terms we may say that if the title insurance referred to in the question is a type of commercial insurance, then it is not permissible to participate in it, unless the system forces people to do that, in which case there is no blame on the Muslim if he participates in it, because he is compelled to do so, and the sin will be borne by those who compelled him to do that.\nSecondly:\nThe fact that haram insurance may serve some interests and offer some benefits to those who participate in it does not mean that it becomes halal, because the things that are prohibited are usually not without some benefits, but the corruption and harms that result from them are much greater.\nWith regard to alcohol itself, which is the mother of all evils and is prohibited in the systems of law of all the prophets, Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{They ask you about wine and gambling. Say, ""In them is great sin and [yet, some] benefit for people. But their sin is greater than their benefit}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:219].\nThus Allah, may He be exalted, affirms that they have some benefits, but He, may He be glorified and exalted, prohibited them because the harm they cause is much greater than any benefits they may bring.\nIt is possible to avoid the problems referred to in the question – namely unpaid taxes, fraud and so on – by checking before buying, and taking the necessary precautions.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/396695/ruling-on-title-insurance-to-protect-the-buyers-rights
225165,What are the most important rulings on shares of inheritance?,"['Praise be to Allah.Importance of knowledge of Islamic law of inheritance\nKnowledge of\xa0Al-fara’id\xa0(allocated shares of inheritance) is one of the most important branches of Islamic knowledge. In three verses of Surah An-Nisa’, Allah, may He be Exalted, states many of the rulings thereon, then the Prophet’s Sunnah explains these rulings in detail.\nThe Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) paid attention to the knowledge of shares of inheritance, as did the Tabi`in (the generation who came after the Companions) and the scholars who came after them, and many books were written about this branch of knowledge.\nWe will mention below some of the main guidelines on this branch of knowledge:\nComponents of inheritance in Islam\nThe essential components of inheritance are:\xa0\n\nthe heir,\xa0\nthe testator (that is, the deceased),\nand what is to be inherited (the estate).\n\nConditions of inheritance in Islam\nThe conditions of inheritance are three:\n\nAscertaining that the heir is alive at the time of the testator’s death, or that he is to be regarded as being effectively among the living, such as a foetus in utero. The foetus may inherit subject to conditions: Firstly establishing that he was in the womb at the time of the testator’s death, even as a\xa0 Nutfah\xa0(fertilised egg); and, secondly, establishing that he was born alive and in stable condition.\nAscertaining that the testator has died, or that he is to be regarded as being effectively among the dead, such as one who is missing.\nKnowing who may inherit, the reason why he is entitled to inherit, his connection to the testator and how close that connection is, and so on.\n\nCauses of entitlement to inheritance\nThe causes of entitlement to inheritance are three:\xa0\n\nNikah (meaning a valid marriage contract only; it is not stipulated that the marriage should have been consummated);\xa0\nWala’ (manumission of a slave);\xa0\nAnd Nasab (blood ties).\n\nImpediments to inheritance\n\nThe impediments to inheritance are three:\xa0\n\n\nenslavement (a slave cannot inherit anything);\xa0\nmurder (the killer cannot inherit anything from the one whom he killed);\xa0\nand difference of religion (a disbeliever cannot inherit from a Muslim and a Muslim cannot inherit from a disbeliever).\n\nCategories of heirs among men\nThere are fifteen categories of heirs among men: the son; the son’s son , no matter how far the line of descent reaches; the father; the paternal grandfather, no matter how far the line of ascent reaches through the male line only; the full brother ; the half-brother through the father; the half-brother through the mother; the son of a full brother; the son of a half-brother through the father, no matter how far the line of descent reaches; the paternal “full-uncle” (full brother of the father); the paternal “half-uncle” (the half-brother of the father through their father), no matter how far the line of ascent reaches; the son of the paternal “full-uncle” (full brother of the father), the son of the paternal “half-uncle” (the half-brother of the father through their father) no matter how far the line of descent reaches; the husband ; and the freed male slave.\nCategories of heirs among women\nThere are ten categories of heirs among women: the daughter ; the son’s daughter, no matter how far her father’s line of descent reaches; the mother ; the maternal grandmother; the paternal grandmother; the full sister; the half-sister through the father; the half-sister through the mother; the wife; and the freed female slave.\nTypes of inheritance in Islam\nInheritance is of two types: Fard (pl. Fara’id – allocated shares) and Ta`sib (residual inheritance).\n\nFard refers to the shares that are allocated to heirs in accordance with the religious texts, such as one half, one quarter, one third, and so on.\nTa`sib refers to what an heir may receive from what is left (the residue) of the estate after those who are entitled to allocated shares have received their shares.\n\nWhat are the allocated shares of inheritance?\nThe allocated shares that are mentioned in the Book of Allah, may He be Exalted, are six: one half, one quarter, one eighth, two thirds, one third and one sixth.\nFirst of all, those who are entitled to allocated shares take their shares. Then if anything is left of the estate, it is taken by the residual heirs. If there is nothing left for them, then they have no share, in accordance with the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “Give the shares of inheritance to those who are entitled to them, and whatever is left goes to the closest male relatives.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 6732 and Muslim, 1615)\nBooks on inheritance on Islam\nAs for the details on the rulings of inheritance, and discussing the case of each heir and the conditions of his inheritance, in all circumstances, that requires detailed discussion for which there is no room here. Please refer to the books that have been written on this topic, the easiest of which include:\n\nAl-Fawa’id Al-Jaliyyah fi’l-Mabaahith Al-Fardiyyah\xa0by Shaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him)\nTas-hil Al-Fara’id\xa0by\xa0 Shaykh Muhammad ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him)\nAt-Tahqiqat Al-Mardiyyah fi’l-Mabahith Al-Fardiyyah\xa0by Shaykh Salih Al-Fawzan (may Allah preserve him).\n\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/225165/rules-of-inheritance-in-islam
