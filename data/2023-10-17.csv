112427,"In the past, I had some devices that are used for entertainment – such as a television, PlayStation, and so on – that I acquired from some of my friends. Because I used them excessively, and not in a good way, I failed to do many obligatory duties. I want to ask about how I can get rid of them. Is it permissible for me to sell them, or should I just destroy them?","['Praise be to Allah.First of all, you should praise Allah, may He be exalted, for having alerted you to save you from heedlessness and wasting time with such things, for they are one of the traps of the Shaytan, into which many young people fall who do not realise how dangerous they are. Young people may spend many years of their lives without striving, advancing or succeeding, and one of them may not come to his senses until he has spent long years of his life playing computer games or watching TV programs that do not benefit him in his worldly affairs and do not increase his faith. Whoever Allah, may He be exalted, saves from this calamity is truly blessed and has been granted well-being by Him, may He be glorified.\nNext, we advise you that it is essential to be careful about how you dispose of these things. If you can use them in ways that are permissible and beneficial, that is best, such as if you can use the television to watch useful and beneficial channels. Otherwise, if you fear that you may become addicted to television again, then you have no other choice except to get rid of it by selling it or giving it to someone who you think is good and righteous, so that he will not use it except for permissible purposes.\nAs for the PlayStation, we do not advise you to keep it; rather you should sell it or give it to someone who has children and will supervise them when they play with it, but will not give them free rein with it.\nAs for selling these devices (the television and PlayStation), or giving them to someone who does not pay attention to the sacred limits set by Allah, it is not permissible to do that, because this will be helping him in sin.\nWe ask Allah to bless you in your life and your work, and to enable you to obey Him.\nPlease see also the answers to questions no. 2898 and 39744 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/112427/how-can-he-get-rid-of-some-devices-used-for-entertainment
21534,"I have some questions about Islam, could you explain them for me? What does Islam say about people of other religions? Are all non-Muslim people regarded as sinners because they do not follow Allah and Islam? Can any non-Muslim person enter Paradise without following Islam?","['Praise be to Allah.The ruling of Islam concerning other religions is that they are all either fabricated and false, or abrogated.\xa0\nThe fabricated and false religions are those like the ancient Arabian practise of worshipping idols and stones.\xa0\nThe abrogated religions are those which were taught by the Prophets who came before our Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).\xa0\nThey are valid in that their origins are from Allah, but Islam came and took their place, not with regard to basic beliefs such as the existence of God , the angels, Paradise and Hell, for these are matters which all the Messengers have in common, but there are differences between them with regard to ways of worshipping and drawing close to Allah by means of prayer, fasting, pilgrimage, alms, etc.\xa0\nThe later followers of the Prophets have fallen into deviations of belief and Shirk (associating partners or equals with Allah), but Islam came to point that out and bring people back to the correct belief taught by the earlier Prophets.\xa0\nAbu Al-Darda (may Allah be pleased with him) said: `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) brought some pages of the Torah to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said, “O Messenger of Allah, these are some pages of the Torah which I took from a brother of mine from (the tribe of) Banu Zurayq.” The expression of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) changed, and ‘Abdullah ibn Zayd (may Allah be pleased with him) – who had been shown the Adhan [in a dream] – said, “Has Allah taken away your mind? Do you not see the expression on the face of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)?” ‘Umar said, “We are pleased with Allah as our Lord and with Islam as our religion and with Muhammad as our Prophet and with the Quran as our guide.” Then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) relaxed, and said, “By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, if Moses (peace be upon him) were to come among you and you were to follow him and leave me, you would have gone far astray. You are my share among the nations and I am your share among the Prophets.” (Narrated by Ahmad, 15437)\xa0\nIbn Hajar said:\xa0\n“All the Isnads (chains of narration) of this Hadith are such that they could not be taken as evidence individually, but when taken together they prove that this Hadith is correct.” (Fath Al-Bari, 13/525)\xa0\nThe evidence for that is the verse in which Allah says (interpretation if the meaning):\xa0\n“And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers”\xa0[Al ‘Imran 3:85]\nImam Al-Tabari (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his commentary on this verse:\xa0\n“Allah means that whoever looks for a religion to follow other than Islam, Allah will never accept that from him, ‘and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers’ meaning, he will be of those who have deprived themselves of their share of the mercy of Allah.” (Tafsir Al-Tabari, 3/339)\xa0\nIslam does not regard them (followers of other religions) only as sinners, but as disbelievers who will abide forever in the Fire of Hell, as stated in the verse quoted above.\xa0\nThe disbeliever will be a loser in Hell, and will not come out of it. It is not possible for a disbeliever to enter Paradise unless he becomes Muslim. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Verily, those who reject Our verses (and signs) and treat them with arrogance, for them the gates of heaven will not be opened, and they will not enter Paradise until the camel goes through the eye of the needle (which is impossible). Thus do We recompense the (wicked) criminals.”\xa0[Al-A’raf 7:40]\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “By the One in Whose Hand my soul is, no one of this nation, Jew or Christian, will hear of me and not believe in that with which I have been sent, but he will be one of the people of Hell.” (Narrated by Muslim)\xa0\nWe ask Allah to guide the seekers of truth from other religions to look into the religion of Islam and its Book, the Quran. May Allah guide them and open their hearts to enter Islam.\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 14055 , 9607 , 308807 , and 21525 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21534/what-does-islam-say-about-other-religions
114272,"Is it permissible to go with my husband’s brother, his mother, his wife and his sister to visit a female relative who is sick, even if the distance is not far in the same city?","['Praise be to Allah.For moving about in the same city, there is no stipulation that one should be accompanied by a mahram; rather what is stipulated is that it should be safe and there should be no causes of temptation, and it is also stipulated that a man should not be alone with a woman who is not his mahram.\nThat “being alone” (khulwah) does not happen if there is another, trustworthy woman present.\nBased on that, there is nothing wrong with going with your husband’s brother, in the company of his mother or sister or wife, to visit your relative, even if that is in the car, because there is no being alone in that case.\nAl-Bukhari (1862) and Muslim (1341) narrated from Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “No man should be alone with a [non-mahram] woman unless she has a mahram with her.”\nAn-Nawawi said:\nThe Prophet’s words, “unless she has a mahram with her” may be understood to mean a mahram of hers, or they may be understood to mean a mahram of hers or of his. This second interpretation is what is in accordance with the basic principles set out by the jurists, so it makes no difference whether she has with her a mahram of hers, such as her son, brother, mother or sister, or it is a mahram of his, such as his sister, daughter, paternal aunt or maternal aunt. It is permissible for the man to sit with her in such cases.""(Sharh Sahih Muslim).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If there is someone who transports girls or teachers, no woman should ever travel on her own with him, because that is the khulwah (“being alone”) that is prohibited. But two women may travel with him, no problem. If someone says: Each woman will exit the bus when she reaches her house, so how can two women travel? We say: Praise be to Allah. If two women’s houses are close to one another, then let one of them come to the house of the other one, and let the two of them get into the vehicle with the driver. This applies if there is not one of the driver’s mahrams with him. If a woman who is one of his mahrams is with him, that is sufficient.""(Al-Liqa’ ash-Shahri\xa01/58).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/114272/can-she-go-with-her-husbands-brother-and-his-wife-to-visit-a-woman-who-is-sick
20958,Is it prohibited to try to prevent wind from coming out during prayer or in order to stay in Wudu before prayer?,"['Praise be to Allah.`Aishah said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “One should not pray when food is ready or when one is trying to stop oneself from doing either of the two things that break Wudu (i.e., urination and defecation).” (Narrated by Muslim, 560)\xa0\nShaykh Muhammad Al-Salih Al-‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\xa0\nIf dinner is ready and a person wants to eat, should he start with the meal even if the time for prayer is going to end?\xa0\nHe replied:\xa0\n“This is an area where the scholars differed. Some of them said that the prayer should be delayed if his mind is going to be distracted by thinking about the food and drink, etc., that are waiting, even if the time for prayer ends.\xa0\nBut the majority of scholars said that the presence of food that is ready is not an excuse for delaying the prayer, rather that applies when food is ready and the prayer is about to be offered in congregation, i.e., a man is excused from praying in congregation when there is food ready that he wants to eat. So he should eat and then go to the mosque, and if he catches up with the congregation that is fine , otherwise there is no blame on him. \xa0\nBut this should not become a habit whereby his food is only prepared at the time of prayer, because this means that he is determined not to pray in congregation. However, if this happens coincidentally, then he is excused for not praying in congregation, and he may eat until he is full, because if he eats only one or two mouthfuls he may crave even more for the food.\xa0\nThis is different from the situation of a man who is starving, when he finds prohibited food such as dead meat. Should we say that if you cannot find anything but dead meat and you fear that you may die or suffer harm, then eat from the dead meat until you are full, or should we say to eat only as much as is necessary? We tell him, eat only as much as is necessary, and if two mouthfuls are enough then do not eat a third.\xa0\nCan this ruling on dinner be applied to other things that disturb a person such as needing to urinate, defecate or pass wind ?\xa0\nThe answer is, yes, this ruling applies in these cases. In the book of Muslim, it is narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not pray when food is ready or when you are trying to stop yourself from doing either of the two things that break Wudu (i.e., urination and defecation)”\n- meaning urination or defecation, and breaking wind is akin to these two.\nThe basic principle is that everything that may distract a person, keep him from being properly focused in his prayer, or worry him, should be dealt with before he starts to pray. \xa0\nThis may be summed up by saying: The essence and spirit of prayer is the proper focus of the heart and mind, hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told us to get rid of everything that may prevent that before a person starts to pray.” (Fatawa Al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 13. question no, 588)\xa0\nThe Shaykh was also asked:\xa0\nIf a person needs to urinate but he fears that he will miss the prayer in congregation if he relieves himself, should he pray whilst he is holding it in, so as to be sure of praying with the congregation, or should he relieve himself even if that means missing the congregational prayer?\xa0\nHe replied:\xa0\n“He should relieve himself and do Wudu, even if he misses the prayer in congregation, because this is a valid excuse. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not pray when food is ready or when you are trying to stop yourself from doing either of the two things that break Wudu (i.e., urination and defecation).” (Fatawa Al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 13, question, 589)\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 11591 , 174361 , 2137 , and 26280 .\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20958/preventing-breaking-wind-to-avoid-invalidating-wudu
