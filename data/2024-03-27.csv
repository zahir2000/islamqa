405075,"My wedding, In sha Allah, will be right after `Eid, and my menstrual cycle is expected in the last week of Ramadan or it might be delayed until the wedding date. Is it permissible to take medication to induce the menstrual cycle in Ramadan before the wedding?","['Praise be to Allah.It is permissible for a woman to take medication to induce menstruation in Ramadan, so that her wedding after `Eid does not coincide with her period, provided that her intention is not to break the fast.\nAl-Mardawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: ""It is permissible to take medication to induce menstruation, as mentioned by Shaykh Taqi Ad-Din [meaning Ibn Taymiyah], and he focused on this in Al-Furu`; except close to Ramadan in order to break the fast, as mentioned by Abu Ya\'la As-Saghir.\nI [Al-Mardawi] say: And there is no opposition to this."" End quote from ""Al-Insaf"" (1/273).\nSee also: ""Al-Furu`"" (1/393), ""Al-Fatawa Al-Kubra"" (5/315).\nAnd Al-Bahuti (may Allah have mercy on him) said: ""(It is permissible) for a female (to take permissible medication) to induce menstruation, not close to Ramadan in order to break the fast; like traveling to break the fast."" End quote from ""Kashshaf Al-Qina`"" (1/218).\nTravel is only prohibited if it is intended as a means to evade the obligation and break the fast in Ramadan.\nHowever, if there is a valid reason for travel, it does not prevent one from doing so, nor does it prevent taking concessions to break the fast in Ramadan or shorten the Salah (formal prayer).\nSo, if your intention is not to break the fast, but rather what you mentioned about fearing that the wedding may occur during menstruation, then there is no harm.\nBut if it is possible for you to take medication after `Eid to prevent menstruation, or to postpone the wedding date to two weeks after `Eid or so, this is preferable to taking medication now that induces menstruation and prevents you from fasting.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/405075/ruling-on-inducing-menstruation-in-ramadan-due-to-wedding-after-eid
45970,Is it permissible for my wife to shake hands with my father?,"[""Praise be to Allah.It is permissible for a wife to shake hands with her father in-law because when a man makes a marriage contract with a woman, his father becomes a Mahram for her , as does his son from another wife. And her mother becomes a Mahram for him, as does her daughter from another husband.\xa0This is called a Mahram by marriage.\xa0\nThe evidence that the husband’s father is a Mahram for the son’s wife is the verse in which Allah mentions the women who are Mahrams (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“the wives of your sons who (spring) from your own loins.” [An-Nisa’ 4:23]\nSo the wife of the son is a Mahram for her husband’s father.\xa0\nThe evidence that the husband’s son is a Mahram for his father’s wife is the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And marry not women whom your fathers married, except what has already passed.” [An-Nisa’ 4:22]\nThe evidence that the wife’s mother is a Mahram for her daughter’s husband is the verse in which Allah mentions the women who are Mahrams (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“…your wives’ mothers.” [An-Nisa’ 4:23]\nThese three (the husband’s father, his son and the wife’s mother) become Mahrams as soon as the marriage contract is conducted, and that is not subject to the condition that the marriage be consummated.\xa0\nWith regard to the wife’s daughter, she does not become a Mahram for her mother’s husband unless he has consummated the marriage with her mother, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“ and your stepdaughters under your guardianship, born of your wives to whom you have gone in — but there is no sin on you if you have not gone in them (to marry their daughters),” [An-Nisa’ 4:23]\nThe stepdaughter (Rabibah) is the daughter of one's wife.\xa0(See Al-Mughni, 9/514, 524)\xa0\nIn conclusion, the husband’s father is a Mahram for his son’s wife, so he may shake hands with her and be alone with her and travel with her.\xa0\nFor more details, please refer to the following answers: 5538 ,\xa0161869 , 32689 , and 20750 .\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45970/is-the-father-in-law-a-mahram
408136,"My friend asks me saying: I experienced a wet dream during the day in Ramadan, and while feeling I may climax, I stopped myself, so as not to invalidate the fast, and I said: Since I stopped myself, there is no need for a full ritual bath, and I did not pay attention to my clothes, whether they were wet or not, and I completely forgot about the matter. After a few days, I remembered again, and when I went back to the clothes in the washing machine, I found yellow discharges with an unpleasant smell, which I assumed were from vaginal infections; because this usually happens to me, and I completed my acts of worship, but doubt still kills me. The question is: Do I need to perform a full ritual bath? Did I have an ejaculation? Do I need to repeat what I have fasted? And if I perform a full ritual bath with the intention of purification from major ritual impurity, do I need to repeat the acts of worship I have performed, and if I do not perform a full ritual bath, do I need to repeat the acts of worship I have done? I want to ask the people of knowledge so that I may be certain of my affair, and for your information, I do not know the difference in smell between palm pollen; because I have never smelled it before, and I get confused if it is the smell of dough, or my discharges from the infections.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nNocturnal emission and the release of semen during sleep do not invalidate fasting, and it is not appropriate for a person to restrain themselves from ejaculation during a nocturnal emission, as it may be harmful.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in ""Al-Mughni"" (3/128): ""If one has a nocturnal emission, it does not invalidate his fast, because it is not by choice, and it is similar to if something enters his throat while he is sleeping."" End quote from Al-Mughni.\nSecondly:\nIf the situation is as you described, with restraining oneself from ejaculation during sleep, and the discharge has an unpleasant smell, and the person in question suffers from vaginal infections, then it appears that this is not semen; because the smell of semen is not unpleasant; it is like the smell of date palm pollen or dough.\nTherefore, she is not required to perform Ghusl (full ritual bath), nor is she required to repeat any of the Salah (formal prayers).\nHowever, if she takes precautionary measures, performs Ghusl, and repeats the prayers she performed after that sleep, it is better for her and will protect her from obsessive doubts.\nAs for fasting, it is valid even if semen has been discharged.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/408136/holding-back-ejaculation-then-seeing-discharge-with-a-bad-odour
1046,What is the proof that women have to cover their feet during prayer for prayer to be accepted?,"['Praise be to Allah.The free woman who has attained the age of maturity is obliged to cover her entire body during prayer , apart from her face and hands, because all of her body is `Awrah. If she prays and any part of her `Awrah becomes uncovered , such as a shin or foot or all or part of her head, then her prayer is invalid, because the Prophet said:\n""Allah will not accept the prayer of a woman who has started to menstruate, except with a Khimar (covering)"" (Reported by Ahmad, Abu Dawud, Ibn Majah and At-Tirmidhi, with an authentic chain of narration)\nAbu Dawud reported from Umm Salamah\xa0(may Allah be pleased with her) that she asked the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) about a woman who prayed wearing a Dir’ (chemise or upper garment) and a Khimar (head cover), but no Izar (lower garment). He said: ""The woman is `Awrah.""\nAs for the face, the Sunnah is to uncover it during prayer , so long as no Non-Mahram men are present.\xa0\nAccording to the majority of scholars, the feet must be covered ; some scholars allow uncovering the feet but the majority say the opposite.\xa0\nAbu Dawud reported from Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) that she was asked about a woman who prayed in a Khimar and Qamis (dress or gown). She said, ""There is nothing wrong with it if the Dir’ (chemise) covers her feet."" In any case, it is better to cover the feet, to be on the safe side.\nAs far as the hands are concerned, there is more leeway: there is nothing wrong with either covering them or uncovering them, although some scholars think that it is better to cover them.\nAnd Allah is the Source of strength.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1046/does-a-woman-have-to-cover-her-feet-when-praying
