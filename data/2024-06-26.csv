268754,What is the ruling on killing large lizards such as monitor lizards? Is there reward for killing them?,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThose lizards or other animals that are proven to be harmful should be killed, so as to ward off their harm.\nBut if it is proven that they are not harmful, then they should not be killed, like all other animals that are harmless.\nThe evidence for that is the proven report that was narrated in as-Sahihayn and elsewhere, according to which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade killing dogs, but he enjoined killing aggressive dogs.\nAnimals that are proven to be harmful come under the same ruling as aggressive dogs, which means that it is prescribed to kill them. Animals that are not harmful come under the same ruling as other dogs, which it is forbidden to kill.\nIbn Muflih said:\nIt says in al-Mughni, regarding the issue of killing dogs: As for those which are not harmful, it is not permissible to kill them. He quoted as evidence the prohibition on killing dogs. The wording indicates that other animals are to be dealt with in the same way. If it were permissible to kill harmless animals other than dogs, then it would be permissible to kill dogs.\nThis is what may be understood from the statements of the scholars, and it is a sound statement.\nBased on that, we may understand that allowing the killing of aggressive dogs in particular means that it is not permissible to kill those that are not harmful.""(Al-Adab ash-Shar‘iyyah\xa03/355).\nSee also the answer to question no. 159518 .\nWhat is known about monitor lizards is that they are not harmful to humans by nature, because they are like lizards (ad-dabb). For that reason, it was narrated from some of the scholars that it is permissible to eat them. See Musannaf ‘Abd ar-Razzaq (4/529).\nBut some of the scholars said that it is haram to eat them, because they are regarded as vermin.\nAd-Dumayri said: Based on this principle, it may be understood that eating large lizards is haram, because they are vermin, and the scholars did not make any exceptions for them.""(Hayat al-Haywaan\xa0 2/542).\nBased on that, so long as monitor lizards are not harmful to humans, they are not to be killed, because killing them is destroying a soul for no reason, and undoubtedly it was not created except for some wise reason intended by Allah, may He be glorified and exalted.\nOne of the most obvious reasons is maintaining environmental balance, so that some animals will not overwhelm others. Monitor lizards are known for killing snakes, so killing lizards and eradicating them from the environment will lead to snakes increasing in number and becoming dominant. Glory be to the Most Wise Creator.\nSee also the answer to question no. 258988 .\nSecondly:\nIf you find some harmful types of large lizards, or some individual lizards whose peaceful nature has changed and they have gone rogue, which is something that happens with many animals, and that results in harm to people, or there is fear of its harm, then such a lizard may be killed. The same applies if [a rogue animal] is attacking someone’s sheep or domesticated animals, and the like. He may ward it off by killing it in order to protect his property, just as any aggressive animal may be killed, even if it is an animal that it is prohibited to kill in principle.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAnimals fall into two categories:\n1.. Those which are harmful and aggressive by nature. It is permissible to kill them, whether they are those which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) mentioned by name – such as scorpions, rats and aggressive dogs – or they are other animals which come under the same ruling for the same reason, namely that they are harmful. Hence the scholars said: It is permissible to kill every harmful animal. Such an animal is to be killed if it is usually harmful and aggressive, even if it has not caused any harm, because it will inevitably cause harm at some other time.\n2.. Animals that do not cause any nuisance or harm. Such an animal is not to be killed, but killing it is not haram, although it is better not to kill it.\nIf it harms you, you may kill it in order to ward off its harm.\nWe only said that it is better not to kill it if it does not harm you, because with regard to what the religious texts say about animals and insects, they fall into three categories:\n1.. Those which we are instructed to kill; 2. Those which we are forbidden to kill; 3. Those concerning which nothing was said about killing them.\nThose which we are instructed to kill include scorpions, rats, aggressive dogs, snakes, geckos and so on.\nThose which we are forbidden to kill include ants, bees and hoopoes.\nThose concerning which nothing was said about killing them include all other animals and insects. Nothing was said concerning them, and it is better not to kill them, because the least that may be said about killing them is that it is destroying a soul for no reason.\nMoreover, some of the scholars said that so long as the creature is still alive, it is glorifying Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, and if it dies, that tasbih (glorification of Allah) will cease, and your killing it means that it will be destroyed and will no longer be glorifying Allah.\nWhatever the case, the ruling is that it is better not to kill it so long as it is not harming you, but if it harms you, then there is nothing wrong with killing it.""(Liqa’at al-Bab al-Maftuh, no. 67).\nIt says in al-Adab ash-Shar‘iyyah by Ibn Muflih (3/355):\nIt says in al-Mustaw‘ib regarding things that are prohibited in ihram: With regard to ants and everything that is neither harmful nor beneficial, such as beetles, scarabs, worms, flies and ants that do not bite or sting, Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If they harm him, he may kill them, but it is disliked (makruh) to kill them if they are not harmful, although if he does that there are no consequences for him.

354831,"My question is about conditions in a transaction which were stipulated by the seller regarding the purchase of land by instalments. 1. If the purchaser fails to pay two consecutive instalments according to the payment plan, he is regarded as having defaulted, therefore there is no need for any warning or notification. In such a case, the seller has the right to terminate the agreement unilaterally and notify the purchaser in writing that it has ended. 2. If the purchaser ends the contract for any reason, the seller will allocate 30% of the purchase price as a stipulated penalty. After settling the penalty clause, the seller will return to the purchaser what remains of the instalments that had been made, in two equal payments, starting one month from the day when the contract was terminated, and the purchaser agrees not to demand any interest or compensation for the delay in repayment… etc. If this condition is not valid, what are the rights of the seller according to Islamic teachings, if the purchaser is unable to pay his debt, or he wants to get out of the contract? What are the valid conditions that the seller may stipulate in order to reduce the harm that would result from the purchaser getting out of the contract?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThere is nothing wrong with stipulating that the deal be cancelled if the purchaser defaults on two consecutive instalments, whether the purchaser is in financial difficulty or is well off but is taking too long to pay.\nIt says in Kashshaf al-Qina‘ (3/240): … or [if] the purchaser is in financial difficulty, even with regard to paying some of the price, then the seller has the right to cancel the deal immediately, because the delay is detrimental to his interests. End quote.\nIt says in al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (32/136): Ibn Taymiyah said that if the purchaser is in financial difficulty or is taking too long to pay, the seller may cancel the deal so as to ward off the harm to which dispute may lead. He said in al-Insaf: This is the correct view. End quote.\nSecondly:\nThere is nothing wrong with the seller stipulating that if the purchaser cancels the deal – with no valid reason according to Islamic teachings that allows him to do that – he must pay 30% of the price, because the basic principle is that conditions are valid.\nThe seller may refuse to cancel the deal, because a sale is a binding contract, but he may agree to cancel it in return for this amount of money, and it is permissible to stipulate that in the contract.\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The Muslims are bound by their conditions.” Narrated by Abu Dawud (3594); classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud.\nAl-Bukhari said in his Sahih: Ibn ‘Awn said, narrating from Ibn Sirin: A man said to the one from whom he wanted to lease a mount: Bring your mount, then if I do not set out with you on such and such a day, then you will have one hundred dirhams. Then he did not go out [on that day]. Shurayh said: Whoever stipulates a condition for himself willingly, without being forced, is bound by it.\nEnd quote from Sahih al-Bukhari: The Book of Conditions, Chapter on What Conditions are Permissible ... It says in a statement of the Islamic Fiqh Council concerning this issue: It is permissible to stipulate penalty clauses in all financial transactions, except in contracts in which there is a commitment to pay off a debt, because that is blatant riba (usury).\nSee the complete statement in the answer to question no. 112090 .\nThirdly:\nWhen cancelling a deal, the seller must return what the purchaser paid. If he stipulated that in the event of cancellation he will return the money in two equal payments, starting one month after cancellation of the deal, and the purchaser accepted that, there is nothing wrong with it, because of what was noted above about the basic principle being that conditions are valid.\nThus it becomes clear that it is permissible to stipulate these conditions in the contract.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/354831/ruling-on-the-seller-stipulating-a-penalty-clause-if-the-purchaser-cancels-the-transaction
