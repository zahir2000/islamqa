325575,"What is the ruling on resting on the knees in the prayer, when sitting for the tashahhud and between the two prostrations, for one who cannot bend his knees or finds it difficult to do so?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nKneeling or resting on the knees is one specific way of sitting, because the one who does that is in a state of alertness and in a hurry. Mostly that happens when one is arguing, or in a state of fear and suspense, and the like.\nAz-Zajjaj (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhat is meant by kneeling or being on one’s knees is resting on one’s knees and toes. Ma‘ani al-Quran wa I‘rabuhu by az-Zajjaaj (4/435).\nImam Ibn Sidah, in al-Mu‘jam al-‘Azim, wrote a section explaining different ways of sitting, in which he said: Kneeling means sitting resting on one’s knees when arguing and the like. End quote from al-Mukhassas (3/333); Lisan al-‘Arab (14/131).\nAsh-Shurayshi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Kneeling means sitting resting on the knees. Sharh Maqamat al-Hariri (2/371).\nTo sum up:\nKneeling is a specific way of sitting, but it is not usually resorted to in a calm situation; rather it is something that is rarely resorted to, or is resorted to when needed.\nSecondly:\nThe Sunnah way of sitting between the two prostrations is iftirash (sitting muftarishan, which means sitting with the right foot held upright on the toes, whilst sitting on the left foot), and this is also done in the tashahhud of a two-rak‘ah prayer; and tawarruk (sitting mutawarrikan, which means slipping the left foot under the right calf, with one’s buttocks on the ground) in the final tashahhud of a three- or four-rak‘ah prayer, as has been explained in the answer to question no. 13340 .\nBut if the worshipper cannot sit muftarishan, or that is extraordinarily difficult for him, for any reason, then he may sit in whatever way is easy for him, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {So fear Allah as much as you are able } [at-Taghabun 64:16], and because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If I instruct you to do something, then do as much of it as you are able.” Al-Bukhari (7288).\nAnd he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to ‘Imran ibn Husayn: “Pray standing; and if you cannot, then sitting; and if you cannot, then lying on your side.” Al-Bukhari (1066).\nThus he explained to him that standing, which is an essential and obligatory part of the prayer, is waived when one is unable to do it, so how about the manner of sitting, which is Sunnah (not obligatory)?\nSo if a person’s prayer is valid if he does not sit in the Sunnah manner without an excuse, then it is more appropriate that his prayer should still be valid when there is an excuse, as the reward for his intention that he would sit in the Sunnah manner if he were able to will be recorded for him.\nAbu Hamid al-Ghazali (may Allah have mercy on him) said: There is no specific way to sit, besides which nothing else could be valid; rather it is valid to sit in whatever way one can.\nEnd quote from Fath al-‘Aziz bi Sharh al-Wajiz (3/494).\nAl-Ansari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Whatever way a person sits in the prayer, it is valid. End quote from Asna al-Matalib (1/164).\nAl-Juwayni (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If he rests on his feet and knees, I do not think that there is anything wrong with it. End quote from Nihayat al-Matlab fi Dirayah al-Madhhab (2/215).\nShaykh Mar‘i al-Maqdisi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Sitting between the two prostrations in any manner is valid, but the Sunnah is to sit muftarishan, resting on the left foot and holding the right foot upright.\nEnd quote from Dalil at-Talib li Nayl al-Matalib (p. 34).\nBased on that, if someone is not able to sit in the Sunnah manner between the two prostrations or in the tashahhud, it is permissible for him to sit resting on his knees.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/325575/is-it-permissible-to-rest-on-the-knees-and-toes-when-sitting-for-the-tashahhud-and-between-the-two-prostrations
65924,What is the ruling on an imam who reads from the Mus-haf when leading prayers in congregation?,"['Praise be to Allah.Reading from the Mus-haf in Sunnah prayers\nThere is nothing wrong with reading Quran from the Mus-haf during an optional prayer, such as Qiyam Al-layl .\xa0\nBut in the case of obligatory prayers, it is disliked to do that, because in most cases there is no need for it. But if there is a need, then there is nothing wrong with reading from the Mus-haf in that case.\xa0\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Mughni, 1/335:\xa0\n“Ahmad said: There is nothing wrong with leading the people in Qiyam prayer whilst reading from the Mus-haf. It was said to him: What about obligatory prayers? He said: I have not heard anything concerning that. Al-Qadi said: It is disliked in obligatory prayers, but there is nothing wrong with it in voluntary prayers if one has not memorized (Quran), but if one has memorized Quran then it is also disliked. He said: Ahmad was asked about leading the prayers whilst reading from the Mus-haf in Ramadan. He said: If that is necessary (it may be done)… and it was narrated from Ibn Hamid that it is equally permissible in both optional and obligatory prayers.\xa0\nThe evidence for it being permissible is the report narrated by Abu Bakr Al-Athram and Ibn Abu Dawud (may Allah have mercy on them) from `A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), according to which she would be led in prayer by a slave of hers who read from the Mus-haf .\xa0\nAz-Zuhri was asked about a man who read from the Mus-haf in Ramadan. He said: The best ones among us used to read from the Mus-hafs …\xa0\nReading from the Mus-haf has been permitted because of the need to listen to the Quran and recite it in night prayers (Qiyam).\xa0\nThe ruling on it being disliked applies only to those who have memorized the Quran, because they will be needlessly distracted from proper submissiveness in prayer (Khushu`) by that, and from looking at the place of prostration. And it is disliked in obligatory prayers in general, because usually there is no need for it.”\xa0\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Majmu` (4/27):\xa0\n“If a person reads Quran from the Mus-haf, this does not invalidate his prayer, whether he has memorized the Quran or not; in fact that is obligatory if he has not memorized Al-Fatihah.\xa0\nDoes reading from the Mus-haf invalidate the prayer?\nWhat we have mentioned, that reading from the Mus-haf does not invalidate the prayer, is our view and the view of Malik, Abu Yusuf, Muhammad and Ahmad.\xa0\nReading from the Mus-haf in obligatory prayer\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Is it permissible for the imam to read from the Mus-haf during the five daily prayers, especially Fajr when lengthy reading is required and there is the fear of making mistakes or forgetting?\xa0\nHe replied:\xa0\n“That is permissible if there is a need for it, just as it is permissible to read from the Mus-haf in Tarawih for one who has not memorized the Quran. Dhakwan, the freed slave of `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) used to lead her in prayer in Ramadan, reading from the Mus-haf, as was narrated by Al-Bukhari in his Sahih in a Mu’allaq Majzum report. It is Sunnah to recite at length in Fajr prayer, so if the imam has not memorized Al-Mufassal or anything else from the rest of the Quran, it is permissible for him to recite from the Mus-haf. But it is prescribed for him to strive to memorize the Quran, or at least to memorize Al-Mufassal, so that he will not need to read from the Mus-haf. Al-Mufassal refers to the portion of the Quran that starts with Surat Qaf, up to the end of the Quran. Whoever strives to memorize, Allah will make it easy for him, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And whosoever fears Allah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty)” [Al-Talaq 65:2]\xa0\n“And We have indeed made the Quran easy to understand and remember; then is there any one who will remember (or receive admonition)?”\xa0[Al-Qamar 54:17]\nAnd Allah is the Source of strength.” (Majmu` Fatawa Ibn Baz, 11/117)\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/65924/can-i-read-from-the-mus-haf-while-praying
307344,Why does the Quran state that women are required to cover their heads in order to have their prayers accepted by Allah but men are not required to do so?,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly, the basic principle is that the rulings apply equally to men and women, as the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said about women: ""They are counterparts to men."" Reported by Al-Bazzar in his Musnad (6418), and authenticated by Shaykh Al-Albani in ""As-Silsilah As-Sahihah"" (2863).\nIbn Al-Arabi Al-Maliki said in ""Al-Masalik"" (2/423): ""It has been narrated that \'women are counterparts to men,\' meaning that their creation is the same, and the rulings for them in Shari`ah are equal."" End quote.\nThis is a matter upon which there is scholarly consensus, as Al-Rajraji stated in ""Raf` Al-Niqab `An Tanqih Ash-Shihab"" (3/217): ""Consensus has been reached that women and men are equal in legal obligations, except for what is indicated by evidence.""\nSecondly, of the rulings where women differ from men is the obligation for a woman to cover her head during Salah;\xa0as a condition for the validity of the prayer is to cover the `Awrah with something that does not describe the skin; as Allah Almighty says (translation of the meaning): {O children of Adam, take your adornment at every mosque} [Al-A`raf/31].\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: ""Allah does not accept the prayer of a menstruating woman except with a headscarf (khimar)."" Reported by Abu Dawud (627), At-Tirmidhi (375), Ibn Majah (655), and authenticated by Al-Albani in ""Al-\'Irwa\'"" (196).\nThere is no disagreement among the scholars regarding the obligation for a woman to cover her head, both inside and outside of the prayer.\nIbn Al-Qattan Al-Fasi said in his book: ""Al-Iqna` fi Masa\'il Al-Ijma`"": ""It is obligatory for a woman to cover her entire body except for her face, and if she does so, her prayer is valid by consensus.\nAnd they unanimously agreed that a free adult woman must cover her head when she prays.\nAnd they unanimously agreed that if she prays with her entire head uncovered, she must repeat the prayer."" End quote (1/121-122).\nThirdly, in reality, the difference here is not between the rulings for women in prayer and the rulings for men in prayer, but rather the prayer here and the covering of the `Awrah in it is an extension of the distinction made by Allah, the Exalted, between the clothing of women and the clothing of men. Generally, in all situations, whether in prayer or otherwise, a man is not required to cover his head, and a woman, in all her situations, whether in prayer or otherwise, is not permitted to uncover her head except in front of her Mahrams (non-marriageable kin).\nAllah, the Exalted, has chosen the attire for the Muslim man and woman in prayer, such that it is in a form of complete adornment and dignity, as Allah loves from His servant and female servant.\nThis choice for the prayer indicates that Allah loves the Hijab for women, even when she is alone before Him, the Exalted, unseen by anyone, and that it is not a ruling related only to the gaze of men, but rather it is attire that Allah loves, to the extent that He chose it for a woman to wear when standing before Allah.\nThe distinction between the two types of clothing here, where a woman covers her head and a man is not required to do so, is also an extension of the natural difference between men and women. The attribute of modesty in a man differs from that in a woman, due to the difference in their nature and creation. A woman is created with adornment, having a nature that differs in her attractiveness and allure from that of a man. Therefore, Shari`ah has distinguished between men and women in clothing, in going out with perfume, and in the requirement of a Mahram for travel, all of which are differences arising from the difference in creation, and Shari`ah\'s concern for the protection of women in a manner that corresponds with the attention she attracts, and the potential danger that such attention may bring to her. In addition to what we have already mentioned, the Hijab itself is something that Allah loves and sees in it modesty and dignity that befit a Muslim woman to exhibit before Him, the Exalted, and this is not required of a man due to the difference in his nature and creation. The differentiation in rulings, commands, and prohibitions based on the difference in nature and creation is something that sound reason supports, and people often practice in their worldly affairs and social lives. The true religion has established and practiced it.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/307344/why-women-are-required-to-cover-their-heads-in-salah-and-men-arent
145601,"Is it permissible for a woman to go to the Haram by herself and do tawaf by herself, going from the hotel that is ten minutes away from the Haram? Is it permissible for a woman to go to Makkah by herself and do tawaf by herself, going from the hotel in which she is staying and which is ten minutes away from the Haram? Is it also permissible for her to go with a group of people, both men and women, to stone the Jamarat without any Mahram, and to do tawaf Al-ifadah without a Mahram?","['Praise be to Allah.It is permissible for a woman, if she is in Makkah, to go walking from the hotel to the Haram without a Mahram , and to do Tawaf likewise, because it is only necessary to have a Mahram for travelling ; inside the city it is not essential to have a Mahram. Rather what is stipulated is that a woman should feel safe in going out and not to wear adornment or make-up when she\xa0 goes out.\xa0\nThe same may also be said concerning her going to stone the Jamarat. She may go there without a Mahram; she may go on her own or with a group of women.\xa0\nIf a woman is in one city and wants to go somewhere in a taxi, it is stipulated that she should not be alone with the driver ; if there is a righteous woman with her, then she is not alone with him.\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“With regard to Khulwah (being alone with a member of the opposite sex) inside the city, it is not permissible for a woman to be alone with the driver in a car, even for a short distance, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “No man should be alone with a woman without a Mahram being present.” But if there is another woman with her and the driver is trustworthy, then there is no Khulwah and there is nothing wrong with her and the other woman travelling in the car, so long as their trip is not regarded as “travel.” In this case, we may say that there is no Khulwah because of the other woman who is present. But we cannot say that the woman who accompanies her is regarded as a Mahram; rather we say that what is forbidden inside the city is a man being alone with a woman, unlike travel, in which case it is forbidden for a woman to travel alone without a Mahram. The difference between these two matters is clear.” (Majmu` Fatawa Ibn `Uthaymin, 21/191)\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/145601/can-women-do-tawaf-without-a-mahram
3009,What is the ruling on using prayer beads?,"['Praise be to Allah.Some scholars say that it is permissible to use the Masbahah (prayer beads), but they say that it is preferable to do Tasbih (count praises) on one’s fingers; others say that it is Bid`ah (reprehensible religious innovation).\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Fatawa (22/187):\xa0\n“Some of them might show off by putting their prayer-mats over their shoulders and carrying their Masbahah in their hands, making them symbols of religion and prayer. It is known from the Mutawatir reports (reports in such large numbers that they couldn’t be forged) that neither the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) nor his Companions used these as symbols. They used to recite Tasbih and count on their fingers, as the Hadith says: “Count on your fingers, for they will be asked, and will be made to speak.” Some of them may count their Tasbih with pebbles or date stones. Some people say that doing Tasbih with the Masbahah is disliked, and some allow it, but no one says that Tasbih with the Masbahah is better than Tasbih with the fingers.” Then he (may Allah have mercy on him) goes on to discuss the issue of showing off with the Masbahah, saying that it is showing off with regard to something that is not prescribed by Islam, which is worse than showing off with regard to something that is prescribed.”\nAl-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Salih Al-`Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked\xa0 (al-Al-Liqa al-Al-MaftoohMaftuh, 3/30) whether using the Masbahah for Tasbih is Bid`ah, and his reply was:\xa0\n“It is better not to do Tasbih with the Masbahah, but it is not Bid`ah , because there is a basis for it, which is the fact that some of the Sahabah (Companions) did Tasbih with pebbles. But the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught us that Tasbih with the fingers is better, as he said, `Count with the fingertips, for they will be made to speak.’ Doing Tasbih with the Masbahah is not haram (impermissible) or Bid`ah, but it is better not to do it, because the one who does Tasbih with the Masbahah has shunned something better. Using the Masbahah may also be contaminated with some element of showing off, because we see some people carrying Masbahah that contain a thousand beads, as if they are telling people, `Look at me, I do a thousand Tasbihs!’ Secondly, those who use the Masbahah for Tasbih are usually absent-minded and not focused, so you see them doing Tasbih with the beads, but their gaze is wandering all over the place, which indicates that they are not really concentrating. It is better to do Tasbih with one’s fingers, preferably using the right hand rather than the left, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to count his Tasbih on his right hand. If a person counts his Tasbih using both hands, there is nothing wrong with that, but it is better to use the right hand only.”\nAsh-Shaykh Muhammad Nasir Al-Din Al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) said in As-Silsilah Ad-Da`ifah (1/110), where he quotes the (inauthentic) Hadith “What a good reminder is the Subhah [Masbahah],”\n“In my view, the meaning of this Hadith is invalid for a number of reasons:\n\nFirstly, the Subhah [Masbahah] is Bid`ah and was not known at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). It happened after that, so how could he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) have encouraged his Sahabah to do something that was unknown to them? The evidence for what I have said is the report narrated by Ibn Waddah in Al-Bid’ wa’l-Nahy `anha from Al-Salt ibn Bahram, who said: `Ibn Mas’ood passed by a woman who had a [Masbahah] with which she was making Tasbih, and he broke it and threw it aside, then he passed by a man who was making Tasbih with pebbles, and he kicked him then said, “You think you are better than the Sahabah, but you are following unjustified Bid`ah! You think you have more knowledge than the Companions of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)!”’ Its chain of narrators is authentic to As-Salt, who is one of the trustworthy followers of the Tabi`in.\nSecondly, it goes against the guidance of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). `Abdulah ibn `Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) said, `I saw the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) counting the Tasbih on his right hand.’”\n\nHe also said (1/117):\xa0\n“If there is only one bad thing about the Masbahah, which is that it takes the place of the Sunnah of counting on the fingers, even though all agree that counting on the fingers is preferable, then that is bad enough. How rarely I see people counting their Tasbih on their fingers!\nMoreover, people have invented so many sophisticated ways of following this Bid`ah, so you see the followers of one of the [Sufi] Tariqahs (orders) wearing the Masbahah around their necks ! Or some of them counting with the beads whilst talking or listening to you! Or another one – the like of whom I have not seen for some time – riding his bicycle through a street crowded with people, with the Masbahah in one of his hands! They are showing the people that they are not distracted from the remembrance of Allah for even an instant, but in many cases this Bid`ah is a cause of their neglecting what is obligatory. It has happened many times – to others as well as myself – that when I greet one of these people with Salam, they answer only by waving and not by saying the words of the greeting. The bad results of this Bid`ah are innumerable, and no one can say it better than the poet:\n`All goodness is in following that which went before (the Salaf)\nAll badness is in the innovations of those who came later.’”\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3009/are-prayer-beads-allowed-in-islam
