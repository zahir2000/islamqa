476499,"We intend, in sha Allah, to slaughter the ‘aqiqah for our daughter, may Allah bless her. My husband does not fast for health reasons; is it permissible to take some of the ‘aqiqah meat and use it to feed poor people for the days on which my husband does not fast in Ramadan?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly\nThe sick person for whom there is no hope of recovery should not fast, and he should feed one poor person for each day.\nAs for the sick person for whom there is the hope of recovery, he may not fast, but he must make up the days he missed when he recovers, and he does not have to offer any fidyah.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Majmu‘ (6/261): The sick person who is unable to fast because of sickness from which he hopes to recover does not have to fast at present, but he must make up the fasts later on. This applies if he will face real hardship when fasting. End quote.\nSo if your husband’s sickness is one from which there is no hope of recovery, it is permissible for him to feed one poor person for each day.\nSecondly:\nIt is permissible to take some of the meat of the ‘aqiqah and use it for the fidyah for not fasting, for two reasons:\n1.. Because only a small part of the ‘aqiqah is to be given in charity, then the one who offered it may dispose of it by eating it himself or otherwise.\nIt says in al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (5/103): Ash-Shafa‘i said: After slaughtering an obligatory sacrifice (udhiyah) in fulfilment of a vow, the person must give all of it in charity.\nAs for the non-obligatory sacrifice, he must give some of the raw meat in charity, and it should not be something that is of no value. The Hanbalis added that if he does not give any of it in charity until it is all gone, then he is liable for giving to the poor the price of the least of it in value that is not regarded as being worthless. End quote.\nIt also says (6/116): With regard to the ‘aqiqah (which is that which is sacrificed on behalf of the newborn), the ruling on whether it is recommended (mustahabb) to eat some of it and feed others with some of it is the same as the ruling on the udhiyah (sacrifice).\n2.. It is permissible to sell the meat of the ‘aqiqah, because it does not go out of the individual’s ownership when he specifies that this is an ‘aqiqah and slaughters it, in contrast to the udhiyah, as it is not permissible to sell any part of the latter. As it does not go out of his ownership, then he has the right to dispose of it in whatever way he likes.\nIt says in Matalib Uli an-Nuha (2/492): It does not go out of his ownership by being slaughtered, so he may sell it, in contrast to the udhiyah, because there is a similarity between the udhiyah and the ‘aqiqah, which is that they are both acts of worship. But the ‘aqiqah is prescribed on a happy occasion, so it is more akin to the walimah (wedding feast). End quote.\nConclusion: It is permissible to take some of the meat of the ‘aqiqah and offer it as fidyah for not fasting, or as expiation for breaking an oath (kaffarat yamin) and so on, because it is meat that belongs to the one who offered it, so it is permissible for him to dispose of it.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/476499/is-it-permissible-to-give-some-of-the-aqiqah-meat-as-expiation-for-breaking-an-oath-or-a-fidyah-for-not-fasting-in-ramadan
109292,"What is the point at which the pilgrim takes off the Ihram garments? Is it after Hajj, Tawaf Al-Ifadah, Sa`i and cutting the hair -- if the intention is to do Hajj only (i.e., Ifrad) -- and has he then exited Ihram completely, or does he not exit Ihram until after the three days of Tashriq and stoning the Jamarat?","['Praise be to Allah.When to exit Ihram in Hajj?\nStanding Committee for Academic Research and Issuing Fatwas said.\xa0\n“Exiting Ihram of Hajj , for both men and women, comes after stoning Jamrat Al-`Aqabah and shaving the head or cutting the hair for men, but women have no option but cutting the hair.\xa0\nAt that point, it becomes permissible for each of them to do everything that was forbidden to them whilst in Ihram, apart from intercourse. As for exiting Ihram completely, that comes after finishing Tawaf Al-Ifadah and Sa`i, if the pilgrim still has to do Sa`i. Then everything that was forbidden to them whilst in Ihram becomes permissible for them, even intercourse.\xa0\nWhen to exit Ihram in `Umrah?\nWith regard to exiting Ihram of `Umrah , for both men and women, it comes after finishing their Tawaf and Sa`i, and shaving the head or cutting the hair for men , but women have no option but cutting the hair and not shaving. Then it becomes permissible for them to do everything that was forbidden to them whilst in Ihram . The one who is doing Hajj and `Umrah together (Qiran) comes under the same ruling as the one who is doing Hajj only (Ifrad) with regard to exiting Ihram.\xa0\nAnd Allah is the source of strength; may Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and Companions.” (Shaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn `Abdullah ibn Baz, Shaykh `Abd Ar-Razzaq `Afifi, Shaykh `Abdullah ibn Ghadyan, Shaykh `Abdullah ibn Qa`ud)\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/109292/when-do-pilgrims-exit-ihram
130263,"We use a classroom to pray in. Recently they have put up posters with guidelines regarding hazardous materials, and the images include images of humans. Is it permissible to pray in this room?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe basic principle is that men should pray in congregation in the mosque, but if there is the fear that some employees may mess about and take too long to come back to work on the grounds that they are going to pray, or the work will be affected, then in that case there is nothing wrong with praying in the workplace.\nPlease see the answers to questions no. 72895 and 74978 .\nSecondly:\nIt is not permissible to pray in places in which there are images of animate beings, except in the case of necessity, because of the report narrated by al-Bukhari (3322) and Muslim (2106) from Abu Talhah (may Allah be pleased with him) from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), who said: “The angels do not enter a house in which there is a dog or an image.”\nThe scholars of the Permanent Committee for Ifta’ were asked:\nIs it permissible for a Muslim to pray in a room of which the walls are covered with images of animals, humans and so on?\nIs it permissible for a Muslim to pray in a garment on which there are images of animals?\nThey replied:\nMaking images of animate beings is haram, and putting images of animate beings on walls and the like is also haram. Praying in a place in which there are such images is not permissible, except in the case of necessity. Similarly, praying in garments on which there are images of animals is not permissible, but if a person does that, his prayer is valid, although that is haram. It is soundly narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that when he saw a curtain in ‘A’ishah’s house on which there were images [of animate beings], he got angry and tore it down, and he said: “The makers of these images will be punished on the Day of Resurrection, and it will be said: Give life to what you have created.”""(Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah\xa0 1/705).\nThey were also asked:\nWe have been working in government departments for several years. They allocated to us one of the distribution halls in the building in which we work, where we pray in congregation during working hours. A while ago, on the front wall in the direction of the qiblah, they put up some large pictures of famous people. We are greatly troubled by the presence of these pictures in front of us when we pray. What do you think about the placing of pictures in the place that has been allocated for the Muslims to pray in for some time? Should we continue to pray there when these pictures are there?\nThey replied:\nThe prayer is valid, and there is no blame on them for that, in sha Allah, if they have no option but to pray in the place mentioned because there is no mosque nearby. But they must try their best to persuade the people in charge to remove the pictures from that place, or give them another place to pray in which there are no pictures or images. That is because praying in a place in which there are pictures or images in front of the worshippers is resembling the idol worshippers, and there are many hadiths which indicate that it is not allowed to resemble the enemies of Allah, and it is enjoined to differ from them. Moreover, putting images of animate beings on walls is something that is not permissible; rather it is one of the means that lead to drifting away and associating others with Allah (shirk), especially if they are images of people who are held in high esteem.""(Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah\xa0 6/250-251).\nBased on that, the prayer offered in this classroom is valid, but you must try hard to get these pictures removed, or at least obliterate the features of the faces, after which there will be no need to remove them.\nIf you are not able to do that, then try to find another place to pray that is free of such pictures and images. But if it is not possible to do that, then there is no blame on you if you pray in this classroom, because you have no choice but to pray there. But it is still important to advise the people in charge to remove these pictures.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/130263/is-it-permissible-to-pray-in-a-room-in-which-there-are-images-of-animate-beings
125711,Is there any reference in the Holy Quran on stoning at the Jamarat?,"['Praise be to Allah.Is Stoning the Jamarat Part of Hajj?\nStoning the Jamarat is one of the obligatory rituals of Hajj and is prescribed for everyone who intends to do this great pilgrimage. This ritual is mentioned clearly in the Sunnah and its authenticity is agreed upon by the scholars.\xa0\nIt was narrated from Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) seated Al-Fadl behind him on his mount, and Al-Fadl (may Allah be pleased with him) said that he did not stop reciting the Talbiyah until he stoned the Jamrah .\xa0(Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 1685 and Muslim, 1282)\nIt was narrated from `Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) that he came to the largest Jamrah and put the House on his left and Mina on his right and stoned it with seven (pebbles), and he said: This is how the one to whom Surat Al-Baqarah was revealed (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) stoned it.\xa0(Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 1748 and Muslim , 1296)\xa0\nIt was narrated from Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that he would stone Al-Jamrah Ad-Dunya (the Jamrah near the Khayf mosque) with seven pebbles, saying Takbir after every throw. Then he would go ahead until he reached the level ground where he would stand facing the Qiblah, and he stood for a long time, offering Du`a and raising his hands. Then he would stone the middle pillar, then he would move to the left towards the middle ground, where he would stand facing the Qiblah. He would remain there for a long time offering du’a’ and raising his hands. Then he would stone Jamarat Al-`Aqabah from the middle of the valley, but he did not stand beside it. Then he would leave and say: This is how I saw the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) doing it.\xa0(Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 1751)\xa0\nIbn Al-Mundhir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Scholars unanimously agreed that if a person stones the Jamarat during the days of At-Tashriq after the sun has passed the meridian, that is valid.” (Al-Ijma` by Ibn Al-Mundhir, 11)\nIbn Hazm (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Scholars agreed that the three days after the Day of Sacrifice are the days for stoning the Jamarat, and that the one who stoned them during those days after the meridian, that is valid.” (Maratib Al-Ijma` by Ibn Hazm, 46)\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“When he reaches Mina, he should start with Jamarat Al-`Aqabah , which is the furthest of the Jamarat from Mina and the closest of them to Makkah, and it is at Al-`Aqabah, hence it is also called Jamarat Al-`Aqabah . He should stone it with seven pebbles, saying Takbir with each throw. He should stand at the middle of the valley and turn to face the Qiblah, then he should leave and should not stay there. This is a summary of the views of those scholars whose views we know.”\xa0 (Al-Mughni, 3/218)\xa0\nWhy do we throw stones at the Jamarat?\nAbu Hamid Al-Ghazali (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“As for the stoning of the Jamarat , the purpose behind it is to follow the command and manifest submission and servitude to Allah, and show complete obedience without rational thought or the ego having any part in it. The aim is also to imitate Ibrahim (peace be upon him), when Shaytan (may Allah curse him) appeared to him in that place to instil confusion in his mind or tempt him to sin, and Allah commanded him to throw stones at him so as to drive him away and dash his hopes. If you ever think that the Shaytan appeared to him and he saw him and that is why he stoned him, but as for me, the Shaytan did not appear to me, it should be noted that this thought is from the Shaytan and that he is the one who is putting it into your mind, so as to slow you down when you are throwing and you will imagine that it is an action in which there is nothing good and that it is like playing, so why should you bother with it? Expel him from your mind with a serious attitude and determination to throw the pebbles despite the Shaytan. Remember that you are outwardly throwing pebbles at Al-`Aqabah, but in fact you are throwing them in the face of the Shaytan and you are breaking his back with them, because nothing annoys him except your obeying the command of Allah out of veneration for Him, simply because of His command, and the soul and mind have nothing to do with it.” (Ihya’ `Ulum Ad-Din, 1/270)\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/125711/is-stoning-the-jamarat-part-of-hajj
