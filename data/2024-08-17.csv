220253,"Someone was praying, and in the last verse of the rak‘ah there was a prostration of recitation. What should he do when standing up from prostrating? Should he bow immediately with the same takbir, or should he say takbir again, raising his hands, then lower his hands, then raise them again and say takbir for bowing?","['Praise be to Allah.The prostration of recitation in the prayer is like any other prostration in the prayer. The worshipper should say takbir when he prostrates for recitation and when he rises from it, without raising his hands in either case.\nWhen he comes back from the prostration of recitation and stands up straight again, as he was doing when he recited, and he wants to bow, then he should say takbir again for bowing, raising his hands, then bow. That is because Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to raise his hands level with his shoulders when he started to pray and when he said takbir for bowing, and when he raised his head from bowing, he raised his hands again.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (735) and Muslim (390).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe prostration of recitation in the prayer is like any other prostration in the prayer. In other words, he should say takbir when he prostrates and when he rises, and it makes no difference whether the prostration comes in the last verse that he recites, or in the middle of his recitation. He should say takbir when he prostrates and say takbir when he rises, then he should say takbir for bowing when he bows. It does not matter if the two takbirs come straight after one another, because the reasons for them are different. Regarding what some people do when they recite a verse that requires a prostration during the prayer, so they prostrate and say takbir when going down into prostration but not when rising from it, I do not know of any basis for that. The difference of scholarly opinion about saying takbir when rising from the prostration of recitation has to do with prostration outside of prayer. But if the prostration of recitation comes in the prayer, then it comes under the same ruling as any other prostration in the prayer. Therefore he should say takbir when going down into prostration and say takbir when rising from prostration.""(Majmu‘ Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymin 14/315).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/220253/when-the-worshipper-stands-up-after-the-prostration-of-recitation-he-should-say-takbeer-for-bowing-raising-his-hands
171060,"What is the ruling on someone who offers a prayer and recites Surat An-Nas (no. 114) in the first Rak`ah, then in the second Rak`ah he recites Surat Ad-Duha (no. 93)?","['Praise be to Allah.Is it Sunnah to recite in accordance with the sequence of Surahs in the Quran?\xa0\nThe Sunnah is for the worshipper to recite in accordance with the sequence of Surahs in the Quran , but if he does not follow that sequence, there is no blame on him and his prayer is still valid, although what he has done is contrary to what is best.\xa0\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Our companions said: The Sunnah is to recite in accordance with the sequence of Surahs in the Quran , one after another. So if he recites a Surah in the first Rak`ah, he should recite in the second Rak`ah the Surah that comes immediately after it. Al-Mutawalli said: Even if he recites “Qul A`udhu\xa0\xa0bi Rabb in-Nas” (i.e., Surat an-Nas, the last Surah in the Quran) in the first Rak`ah, in the second Rak`ah he should recite the opening verses of Al-Baqarah. If he recites a Surah then in the second Rak`ah he recites the Surah that precedes it, this is contrary to what is best, but there is no blame on him. And Allah knows best.” (Sharh Al-Muhadhdhab, 3/348)\xa0\nCan you recite a longer surah in the second Rak`ah?\nThe Sunnah is for the imam or the person who is praying on his own to recite in the first Rak`ah a Surah that is longer than what he recites in the second Rak`ah, because of the report narrated by Abu Qatadah (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to recite in the first two Rak`ahs of Dhuhr, Al-Fatihah and two Surahs, and in the last two Rak`ahs he recited Al-Fatihah (only), and he would make the first Rak`ah lengthy but the second not as long. And he did likewise in `Asr and Fajr. (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 734 and Muslim, 685)\xa0\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“It is recommended to make the first Rak`ah lengthy in all prayers, so that the one who wants to join the prayer may (have time) to do so… because of the Hadith of Abu Qatadah (may Allah be pleased with him).\xa0Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) said, concerning the imam who makes the second Rak`ah longer than the first: He should be told to go and learn. He also said, concerning the imam who makes the first Rak`ah short and the second long: This is not appropriate; he should be told to follow the Sunnah.” (Al-Mughni, 1/334)\nThe scholars of the Standing Committee (6389) were asked:\xa0\nIs it permissible when reciting during the prayer to make the first recitation a short Surah or a lengthy Surah? Many people recite a short Surah in the first Rak`ah and a longer one in the second.\xa0\nThey replied:\xa0\n“The Sunnah is to recite in the first Rak`ah after Al-Fatihah a longer Surah than in the second Rak`ah, because of the report narrated by Abu Qatadah (may Allah be pleased with him) … And they quoted the Hadith referred to above. But if he makes them of equal length or he recites a longer Surah in the second Rak`ah, there is nothing wrong with that, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did that sometimes, as it is proven that he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to recite in Jumu`ah prayer Al-A`la (no. 87) and Al-Ghashiyah (no. 88), and Al-Ghashiyah is slightly longer.” (Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah lil-Buhuth Al-`Ilmiyyah wal-Ifta’, Shaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn `Abdullah ibn Baz, Shaykh `Abd Ar-Razzaq `Afifi, Shaykh `Abdullah ibn Ghadyan, Shaykh `Abdullah ibn Qa`ud)\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: What is the ruling if the imam recites in the first Rak`ah of the prayer, for example, Surat Al-Ikhlas (no. 112) then in the second Rak`ah he recites Ad-Duha (no. 93)?\xa0\nHe replied:\xa0\n“There is nothing wrong with the Imam reciting in the first Rak`ah less than he recites in the second, because of the general meaning of the words of Allah, may He be Glorified:\n“So recite as much of the Quran as may be easy (for you)” [Al-Muzzammil 73:20].\nAnd the general meaning of the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to the one who prayed badly: “When you get up to pray, do Wudu’ properly, then turn to face the Qiblah, say Takbir, then recite as much as you are able to of Quran.” According to another version: “Then recite Al-Fatihah and whatever Allah wills…”\xa0\nBut by doing so, he has omitted to do what is preferable, because the confirmed Sunnah, from the words and deeds of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) indicates that the Sunnah, both for the imam and one who is praying on his own, is to recite a longer portion in the first Rak`ah than in the second, in all five prayers. As for one who is praying behind an imam, he should follow his imam.” (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 11/83)\xa0\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 20043 , 6422 , and 97484 .\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/171060/can-you-recite-a-longer-surah-in-the-second-rakah
515785,"I heard that if the debtor does not return the money before the debt period ends, the lender will receive the reward of charity for each day of delay. If the time to pay comes and the borrower does not give the money back, so the lender gives him extra time, the reward will be doubled. But is it best for me to waive the debt, meaning that he will never pay it, or to accept the virtue of the doubled reward after the debt period ends? Does this also apply if I do not give the debtor a specific period to pay off the debt, and will I get the reward of charity for each day, or until it is doubled?","['Praise be to Allah.The religious texts enjoin allowing extra time for a debtor who is in difficulty, and encourage doing that. They state that the lender will have the reward of giving the amount of the debt in charity every day, until the time for repayment comes. And if he allows him extra time after payment becomes due, then he will have a double reward for charity.\nSee the answer to question no. 192301 .\nSecondly:\nWhat is mentioned above does not mean that allowing extra time for payment of the debt is better than waiving it. Rather waiving the debt in full or in part is better than allowing extra time.\nThat is because waiving the debt is in fact allowing extra time and more.\nThis is what is indicated by the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{If the debtor is in difficulty, give him time until it is easy for him to repay. But if you remit it by way of charity, that is better for you, if only you knew}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:280].\nAl-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIn these words, Allah, may He be exalted, recommends giving charity to the one who is in difficulty, and He describes that as being better than allowing him more time to pay off the debt. This was stated by as-Suddi, Ibn Zayd and ad-Dahhak. End quote.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said in his commentary on Surat al-Baqarah:\nWhat we learn from the verse is the virtue of waiving a debt, and that it is an act of charity, because Allah, may He be exalted, says: {But if you remit it by way of charity, that is better for you}.\nWaiving it is Sunnah, and giving the debtor more time is obligatory; in this instance, what is Sunnah is better than what is obligatory according to the text of the Qur’an, because Allah, may He be exalted, says: {But if you remit it by way of charity, that is better for you}. That is because what is obligatory is included in what is Sunnah, because waiving the debt for one who is in difficulty is giving him extra time and more. Based on that, the one who was confused about this issue thought that what is obligatory is better than what is Sunnah. We may say to him that his view is wrong, because this Sunnah is included in what is obligatory, so it is obligatory and more. Allah spoke the truth when He said in the hadith qudsi: “My slave does not draw close to me by anything more beloved to Me than what I have made obligatory for him.” End quote.\nAnd Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his commentary on the verse quoted above:\nHere Allah, may He be exalted, enjoins [the lender] to be patient with the one who is in difficulty and cannot afford to pay off his debt. Hence He says: {If the debtor is in difficulty, give him time until it is easy for him to repay}.\nThen Allah encourages the lender to waive the debt, and promises much good and great reward in return for that, as He says: {If the debtor is in difficulty, give him time until it is easy for him to repay. But if you remit it by way of charity, that is better for you, if only you knew}. In other words: if you give up your capital altogether and waive the debt for the debtor. There are hadiths narrated via several chains of narration from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) which speak of that. End quote.\nBased on that, the best is to waive the debt in full or in part from the debtor.\nThirdly:\nWith regard to the debt for which no time has been set for payment, the basic principle is that it is due at any time, meaning that the lender may ask for it to be paid immediately.\nImam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Every loan is due at any time. End quote. What is meant is that this is the basic principle, so long as there is no agreement on a deadline for payment. See: ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘ (9/101).\nWhat appears to be the case – and Allah knows best – is that for every day that goes by, the lender will have the reward of giving the amount of his debt in charity, and this is like the debt for which payment has now become due.\nAlso applicable to this debt is the idea that waiving the debt from the debtor in whole or in part is better than giving him more time to pay it off, and there is goodness in both options.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/515785/is-giving-a-debtor-more-time-to-pay-better-than-waiving-the-debt
21581,"Some people who recite Ruqyah for those who are possessed or who suffer epilepsy, recite Quran over water and blow into it, then they tell the sick person to wash with this water. What is the ruling on doing that?","['Praise be to Allah.Blowing into water is of two types:\xa0\n\nIf reciting the Quran and blowing into water is done with the intention of seeking Barakah (blessing) from the saliva of the one who blows into it, this is undoubtedly prohibited, because the saliva of any person is not a means of blessing and healing, and there is no one from whose relics blessing may be sought except Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Blessing cannot be sought from the relics of anyone else.\xa0\n\nBlessings were sought from the relics of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) during his life and after his death, if those relics remained.\xa0\nUmm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) had a small bell-shaped vessel of silver in which she kept some hairs of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), from which the sick sought healing.\xa0\nIf a sick person came to her, she would pour some water over these hairs and stir it, then give it to the sick person.\xa0\nBut apart from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), it is not permissible to seek blessing from the saliva of anyone, or from his sweat or his garment, etc. Rather this is prohibited and is a kind of polytheism. If the blowing into the water is done for the sake of seeking blessings from the saliva of the one who blows on it, then it is prohibited and is a kind of polytheism.\xa0\nThat is because everyone who attributes an effect to something with no evidence from Shari`ah or proof in reality, has committed a kind of shirk, because he is making his blowing as a cause of healing alongside Allah, and proving that something is a cause of something else is to be based on Shar`i evidence. Everyone who follows a means that Allah has not made to be a cause, either according to reality or Shari`ah, has committed a kind of polytheism.\xa0\n\nIf a person blows with saliva after reciting Quran, such as Al-Fatihah – which is a kind of Ruqyah and is the greatest kind of Ruqyah that may be recited over a sick person – so he recites Al-Fatihah then blows into the water – there is nothing wrong with this.\xa0\n\nSome of the Salaf did this, and it is effective and beneficial by Allah’s leave. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to blow into his hands when going to sleep, after reciting Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad , and Qul A`udhu bi Rabbil-Falaq and Qul A`udhu bi Rabbin-Nas , then he would wipe his hands over his face and whatever he could of his body.\nAnd Allah knows best..']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21581/reciting-quran-then-blowing-into-water
