406646,"I cleaned my ears during the daytime in Ramadan for 10 days; as I suffer from an allergy that causes itching and scratching in my ear, and I used to clean it as a usual habit, with or without scratching, and my cleaning was vigorous with a tissue, or with a stick that I insert as far as possible into the ear. I follow the Shafi`i school of thought, and I thought that cleaning the ear was only disliked, but when I read the ruling today and was shocked to find that it breaks the fast according to the Shafi`is. So, should I make up for the past days when I cleaned my ears, or is my fasting considered valid?","['Praise be to Allah.Cleaning the ears by inserting a tissue, a stick, or the like does not invalidate fasting according to the four schools of thought, and we have not come across any scholar\'s opinion that this invalidates fasting.\nHowever, if cleaning is done by pouring something into the ear, such as medicine or drops, and it reaches the inside of the brain, the majority of Jurists, and this is the most correct view according to Ash-Shafi`i, have opined that the fast is invalidated if medicine, oil, or water is used.\nAsh-Shafi`i has another opinion, which is that this does not invalidate the fast.\nAn-Nawawi said: ""If he pours water or something else into his ears, and it reaches his brain, he breaks his fast, according to the most correct view among us, and Al-Ghazali did not consider drops as a nullifier of the fast."" End quote from ""Al-Majmu`"" (6/320).\nAl-Baghawi said: ""If he eats something intentionally, even if little, or drinks, or uses nasal medicine, or nasal\xa0 or ear drops ; such that it reaches the brain, or has an enema, or uses drops in his urethra and it reaches the bladder - his fast is invalidated.\nIt is said: If he pours something into his ear, it does not invalidate his fast, even if its effect appears in the brain; because there is no passage from the ear to the brain, but it reaches it through the pores."" End quote from ""At-Tahdhib fi Fiqh Al-Imam Ash-Shafi`i"" (3/161).\nAl-`Imrani said: ""If he pours water into his ear, and it reaches his brain... there are two views: The first one - which is the view of Sheikh Abu Ishaq and Abu `Ali Al-Sanji - is that it invalidates his fast; because it reaches his brain, and it is like nasal medicine.\nThe second - which is the view of Al-Mas`udi: that it does not invalidate his fast; because it does not penetrate from the ear to the brain, but it reaches it through the pores."" End quote from ""Al-Bayan fi Madhhab Al-Imam Ash-Shafi`i"" (3/501).\nIt has been previously stated on our site in Fatwa No. (80208 ), that ear drops do not break the fast according to the more correct opinion.\nIn conclusion: Cleaning your ears while fasting with a tissue, a stick, or the like has no effect on the validity of your fast, and therefore you are not required to make up those days.\nIt appears that the information that reached you about breaking the fast by cleaning the ear was talking about cleaning the ear with water - ear flushing; this, and the like, is what invalidates the fast according to your school of thought.\nIf you have done that, then you must make up the days in which you cleaned your ears with water, or the like, because that invalidates the fast - according to the school of thought of Imam Ash-Shafi`i, which you follow.\nNevertheless, we advise you to abandon this harmful and dangerous habit and to consult a specialist doctor, as this behavior poses a risk to your ears.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/406646/does-cleaning-ears-affect-the-fast
405075,"My wedding, In sha Allah, will be right after `Eid, and my menstrual cycle is expected in the last week of Ramadan or it might be delayed until the wedding date. Is it permissible to take medication to induce the menstrual cycle in Ramadan before the wedding?","['Praise be to Allah.It is permissible for a woman to take medication to induce menstruation in Ramadan, so that her wedding after `Eid does not coincide with her period, provided that her intention is not to break the fast.\nAl-Mardawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: ""It is permissible to take medication to induce menstruation, as mentioned by Shaykh Taqi Ad-Din [meaning Ibn Taymiyah], and he focused on this in Al-Furu`; except close to Ramadan in order to break the fast, as mentioned by Abu Ya\'la As-Saghir.\nI [Al-Mardawi] say: And there is no opposition to this."" End quote from ""Al-Insaf"" (1/273).\nSee also: ""Al-Furu`"" (1/393), ""Al-Fatawa Al-Kubra"" (5/315).\nAnd Al-Bahuti (may Allah have mercy on him) said: ""(It is permissible) for a female (to take permissible medication) to induce menstruation, not close to Ramadan in order to break the fast; like traveling to break the fast."" End quote from ""Kashshaf Al-Qina`"" (1/218).\nTravel is only prohibited if it is intended as a means to evade the obligation and break the fast in Ramadan.\nHowever, if there is a valid reason for travel, it does not prevent one from doing so, nor does it prevent taking concessions to break the fast in Ramadan or shorten the Salah (formal prayer).\nSo, if your intention is not to break the fast, but rather what you mentioned about fearing that the wedding may occur during menstruation, then there is no harm.\nBut if it is possible for you to take medication after `Eid to prevent menstruation, or to postpone the wedding date to two weeks after `Eid or so, this is preferable to taking medication now that induces menstruation and prevents you from fasting.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/405075/ruling-on-inducing-menstruation-in-ramadan-due-to-wedding-after-eid
45970,Is it permissible for my wife to shake hands with my father?,"[""Praise be to Allah.It is permissible for a wife to shake hands with her father in-law because when a man makes a marriage contract with a woman, his father becomes a Mahram for her , as does his son from another wife. And her mother becomes a Mahram for him, as does her daughter from another husband.\xa0This is called a Mahram by marriage.\xa0\nThe evidence that the husband’s father is a Mahram for the son’s wife is the verse in which Allah mentions the women who are Mahrams (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“the wives of your sons who (spring) from your own loins.” [An-Nisa’ 4:23]\nSo the wife of the son is a Mahram for her husband’s father.\xa0\nThe evidence that the husband’s son is a Mahram for his father’s wife is the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And marry not women whom your fathers married, except what has already passed.” [An-Nisa’ 4:22]\nThe evidence that the wife’s mother is a Mahram for her daughter’s husband is the verse in which Allah mentions the women who are Mahrams (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“…your wives’ mothers.” [An-Nisa’ 4:23]\nThese three (the husband’s father, his son and the wife’s mother) become Mahrams as soon as the marriage contract is conducted, and that is not subject to the condition that the marriage be consummated.\xa0\nWith regard to the wife’s daughter, she does not become a Mahram for her mother’s husband unless he has consummated the marriage with her mother, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“ and your stepdaughters under your guardianship, born of your wives to whom you have gone in — but there is no sin on you if you have not gone in them (to marry their daughters),” [An-Nisa’ 4:23]\nThe stepdaughter (Rabibah) is the daughter of one's wife.\xa0(See Al-Mughni, 9/514, 524)\xa0\nIn conclusion, the husband’s father is a Mahram for his son’s wife, so he may shake hands with her and be alone with her and travel with her.\xa0\nFor more details, please refer to the following answers: 5538 ,\xa0161869 , 32689 , and 20750 .\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45970/is-the-father-in-law-a-mahram
