145514,"Could you explain to me this hadith: it was narrated from Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever would like his rizq (provision) to be abundant and his lifespan to be extended, let him uphold his ties of kinship”? What is meant by “and his lifespan to be extended”?","['Praise be to Allah.Al-Bukhari (2067) and Muslim (2557) narrated that Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “Whoever would like his rizq (provision) to be abundant and his lifespan to be extended, let him uphold his ties of kinship.”\nAbundance in provision means that it is increased, caused to grow and expand, and made blessed; it refers to it being increased in a real sense.\nThe explanations given by the scholars for the phrase “yunsa’ lahu fi atharihi [translated above as: and his lifespan to be extended]” differed.\nIt was said that it means an increase in his physical strength.\nAnd it was said that it refers to blessing in his lifespan, being enabled to do acts of worship and obedience, being enabled to use his time in ways that will benefit him in the hereafter and ensuring that his time is not wasted in anything other than that.\nAnd it was said that what is meant is that he will be well remembered after he dies.\nAnd it was said that it means that his lifespan is written and connected to a condition such as a stipulation that if he uphold his ties of kinship, then his life will be [increased by] such and such, otherwise it will only be as originally decreed, so the addition to his lifespan will be an addition in a real sense.\nSee: Sharh an-Nawawi ‘ala Muslim (16/114); Fath al-Bari (4/302).\nThis last view is the one that is most likely to be correct. So what the hadith means is: whoever would like his provision to be made abundant, so that it will increase and be blessed for him, or would like his lifespan to be extended, let him uphold his ties of kinship.\nThus upholding ties of kinship is a prescribed means of increasing and expanding provision and of increasing and extending one’s lifespan. Were it not for that, this would not be his provision and this would not be his lifespan – by the decree and wisdom of Allah, may He be exalted.\nShaykh al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Sahih al-Adab al-Mufrad (1/24):\nThe hadith is to understood according to its apparent meaning, which is that Allah, in His wisdom, has caused upholding of ties of kinship to be a prescribed means of extending one’s lifespan. The same applies to having a good attitude and being good to one’s neighbours, as is mentioned in some sahih hadiths. This does not contradict what is well-known in Islamic teachings, that lifespans are already decided, because that is correct when looking at when lifespans end. This is exactly like the issue of whether a person is blessed (destined for Paradise) or doomed (destined for Hell). Whether a person is blessed or doomed is already decided with regard to individuals. However, it is well established in Islamic teachings that being blessed or doomed is connected to causes that lead to these two ends, as is mentioned in the religious texts.\nThat is similar to the case of faith (iman), which may increase and decrease. It increases when one does acts of worship and obedience and it decreases when one commits sins, yet that does not contradict what is written in al-Lawh al-Mahfuz. By analogy, lifespans may increase and decrease, depending on the measures that an individual takes. This also does not contradict what is written in al-Lawh al-Mahfuz. End quote.\nAt-Tahawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIt may be that when Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, wanted to create a particular soul, He decreed that if it upheld ties of kinship, its lifespan would be such and such [longer] and if it did not uphold ties of kinship, it would be of a shorter duration. Similarly, if that person offered supplication, certain things would be warded off from him, and if he did not offer supplication, certain things would befall him; if he did certain deeds, he would be deprived of certain things, and if he did not do those deeds, he would be granted certain things. All of that could be written in the pages of decrees to which nothing can be added and nothing can be taken away.""(Bayan Mushkil al-Athar\xa0 7/202).\nAl-Halimi (may Allah have mercy on him) said regarding the meaning of the hadith: in some cases, Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, decrees that if a person upholds his ties of kinship, he will live for a certain number of years, and if he severs those ties, he will live for fewer years than that. In this way we may understand the idea of something being added to his lifespan.""(Shu‘ab al-Iman\xa0 6/219).\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nA person’s lifespan is two lifespans, one that is not connected to anything, which is known only to Allah, and one that is subject to conditions. This explains the meaning of the Prophet’s words “Whoever would like his rizq (provision) to be abundant and his lifespan to be extended, let him uphold his ties of kinship.” Allah instructed the angel to write down the lifespan for him, and said: If he uphold his ties of kinship, I will increase it by such and such. The angel does not know whether it will be increased or not, but Allah knows how things will turn out, then when his ordained time of death comes, it will not be brought forward or put back.""(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa\xa0 8/517).\nShaykh Salih al-Fawzan (may Allah preserve him) said:\nWhat this means is that Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has promised the one who upholdd his ties of kinship that He will reward him by extending his lifespan and making his provision abundant, as a reward for his doing good.\nThere is no contradiction between this hadith and the hadith which says that the lifespan and provision of every person is already decreed when he is in his mother’s womb, because there are causes that Allah has ordained to extend one’s lifespan and causes for obtaining provision. This hadith indicates that being kind and upholding ties of kinship are a cause of lifespans being extended and provision being increased. It is Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, Who decrees things and ordains causes. There are things that Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has ordained and connected to causes and means. If these means are taken, fulfilling all the necessary conditions and avoiding impediments, then the expected results will materialise by His will and decree, and as a reward from Allah, may He be glorified and exalted.""(Al-Muntaqa min Fatawa al-Fawzan\xa0 98/1).\nShaykh Ibn Jibrin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThat is because Allah will reward a person with a reward that matches his deed. So whoever upholds his ties of kinship, Allah will increase his lifespan and provision in a real sense. And the opposite of that is that whoever severs ties of kinship, Allah will cut short his lifespan and provision.""(Fatawa ash-Shaykh Ibn Jibrin\xa0 54/13).']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/145514/commentary-on-the-hadith-whoever-would-like-his-rizq-provision-to-be-abundant-and-his-lifespan-to-be-extended-let-him-uphold-his-ties-of-kinship
146569,"It was narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that he said: “Allah has ninety-nine names; whoever memorises them will enter Paradise,” and one of these names is the greatest name of Allah which, if He is called upon thereby, He will answer and if He is asked thereby, He will give.","['Praise be to Allah.Reference to the greatest name of Allah in the Sunnah\nA number of Hadiths were narrated concerning the “greatest name of Allah ,” the most famous of which are the following:\n\nIt was narrated from Abu Umamah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The greatest name of Allah is in three Surahs of the Quran: Al-Baqarah, Al `Imran and Ta-Ha .” (Narrated by Ibn Majah, 3856; classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah)\nIt was narrated from Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) that he was sitting with the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and a man was praying then he said in supplication: O Allah, I ask You by virtue of the fact that all praise is due to You; there is none worthy of worship but You alone, and You have no partner or associate, the Bestower, the Originator of the heavens and the earth, the Possessor of majesty and honour, O Ever-Living, O Sustainer. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “He has asked Allah by His greatest name which, if He is called upon thereby He answers and if He is asked thereby He gives.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 3544, Abu Dawud, 1495, An-Nasa’i, 1300 and Ibn Majah, 3858. Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud.)\nIt was narrated from Buraydah ibn Al-Husayb (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) heard a man saying: O Allah, I ask You by virtue of the fact that I bear witness that You are Allah, there is none is worthy of worship but You, the One, the Eternal Refuge, Who neither begets nor is born, nor is there to Him any equivalent. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “He has indeed asked Allah by His greatest name, which if He is asked thereby, He gives and if He is called upon thereby, He answers.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 3475, Abu Dawud, 1493, Ibn Majah, 3857; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud)\n\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThis is the soundest of all reports concerning this matter in terms of its Isnad (chain of narration).\n\nIt was narrated from Asma’ bint Yazid (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The greatest name of Allah is in these two verses: `And your god is one God. There is no deity [worthy of worship] except Him, the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful’ [Al-Baqarah 2:163] and at the beginning of Surah Al `Imran: `Alif, Lam, Mim. Allah - there is no deity except Him, the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of existence’ [Al `Imran 3:1-2].” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 3478, Abu Dawud, 1496 and Ibn Majah, 3855)\n\nThis Hadith is inauthentic. Its Isnad includes `Ubaydullah ibn Abu Ziyad and Shahr ibn Hawshab, both of whom are weak narrators.\nScholars’ views on the greatest name of Allah\nThe scholars differed concerning the “greatest name of Allah” and whether there is such name. There are several views:\n\nThe first view is that there is no such name! Because they believe that none of the names of Allah, may He be Exalted, can be regarded as superior to another. These scholars interpreted the Hadiths quoted above in various ways:\n\n\nSome said that what is meant by the word Al-A`tham (the greatest) is Al-`Athim (the great), and that there can be no differentiation between the names of Allah, may He be Exalted.\n\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Some scholars – such as Abu Ja`far At-Tabari, Abu Al-Hasan Al-Ash`ari and a number of others after them, such as Abu Hatim ibn Hibban and Al-Qadi Abu Bakr Al-Baqillani, rejected that and said that it is not permissible to regard some of the divine names as being superior to others. Some of them attributed that view to Malik, because he regarded it as disliked to habitually recite or repeat one Surah rather than others, lest it be thought that some parts of the Quran are better than others, and that lead to believing that the less favoured parts are inferior to those that are more favoured. They interpreted the reports concerning that as indicating that what is meant by “the greatest” is “great”, and that all the names of Allah are great. When Abu Ja`far At-Tabari said: The reports differ as to which is the greatest name, and in my view all opinions are sound, because none of these reports state that it is the greatest name, and nothing is greater than Him, it was as if he was saying: each of the names of Allah, may He be Exalted, may be described as the greatest, in the sense that they are all great, as noted above.”\n\nThat what is intended in the Hadiths quoted above is to highlight the extra reward for the one who calls upon Allah by that name.\n\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Ibn Hibban said: What is meant by the greatness mentioned in the reports is the extra reward granted to the one who calls upon Allah by that name, just as there are Hadiths which speak of great reward for the one who recites the Quran; what is meant thereby is the extra reward of the reciter.”\xa0\n\nThat what is meant by the greatest name is the frame of mind and focus of the one who is calling upon Allah by that name, which includes everyone who calls upon Allah, may He be Exalted, by any of His names, if he has the right frame of mind.\n\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“It was said that what is meant by the greatest name is any of the names of Allah, may He be Exalted, by which a person calls upon Him with complete submission and focus of mind, in the sense that at that moment he has nothing in his mind except Allah, may He be Exalted. Whoever is like that will receive a response. Something similar to this was narrated from Ja`far As-Sa diq, from Al-Junayd, and from others.”\xa0\n\nThe second view is the view of those who say that Allah, may He be Exalted, has kept to Himself knowledge of His greatest name, and that He has not granted knowledge thereof to any of His creation.\n\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Others said: Allah, may He be Exalted, has kept to Himself knowledge of His greatest name, and that He has not granted knowledge thereof to any of His creation.” (See: Fath Al-Bari, by Ibn Hajar, 11/224)\n\nThe third view is the view of those who affirmed that the greatest name of Allah exists and that it is a specific name, but they differed as to which is the greatest name, and there are fourteen views! Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) has listed them in his book Fath Al-Bari (11/224-225). They are as follows:\n\n\nHu! (He!)\nAllah\nAllah Ar-Rahman Ar-Rahim (Allah the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful)\nAr-Rahman Ar-Rahim Al-Hayy Al-Qayyum (the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, the Ever-Living, the Sustainer)\nAl-Hayy Al-Qayyum (the Ever-Living, the Sustainer)\nAl-Hannan Al-Mannan Badi` As-Samawati wa’l-Ard Dhul-Jalali wal-Ikram Al-Hayy Al-Qayyum (the Compassionate, the Bestower, the Originator of the heavens and the earth, the Possessor of majesty and honour, Ever-Living, Sustainer)\nBadi` As-Samawati wa’l-Ard Dhul-Jalali wal-Ikram (the Originator of the heavens and the earth, the Possessor of majesty and honour)\nDhul-Jalali wal-Ikram (the Possessor of majesty and honour)\nAllahu la ilaha illa Huwa Al-Ahad As-Samad alladhi lam yalid wa lam yulad wa lam yakun lahu kufuwan ahad (Allah there is none worthy of worship but He, the One, the Eternal Refuge, who neither begets nor is born, Nor is there to Him any equivalent)\nRabb Rabb (Lord, Lord)\nThe prayer of Dhun-Nun in the belly of the fish: la ilaha illa anta subhanaka inni kuntu min Ath-thalimin (There is none worthy of worship\xa0 except You; Exalted are You. Indeed, I have been of the wrongdoers) [Al-Anbiya’ 21:87 -\xa0 interpretation of the meaning]\nHuwa Allah Allah Allah alladhi la\xa0 ilaha illa Huwa Rabb Al-`arsh Al-`athim (He is Allah, Allah, Allah, besides Whom there is no other god, Lord of the mighty Throne)\nIt is concealed within the divine names\nThe word of Tawhid: La ilaha ill-Allah (there is none worthy of worship but Allah).\n\nShaykh Al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“It should be understood that the scholars differed as to which is the greatest name of Allah, and there are fourteen views, which were listed by Ibn Hajar in Al-Fath, followed by the evidence for each view. Most of the evidence is from the Hadiths, but in some cases it is simply the view of an individual and no attention need be paid to it, such as the twelfth view, the evidence for which is that so and so asked Allah to teach him the greatest name, then he saw in a dream that it was “Allah Allah Allah alladhi la\xa0 ila ha illa Huwa Rabb Al-`arsh Al-`athim (He is Allah, Allah, Allah, besides Whom there is no other god, Lord of the Mighty Throne)”!\nSome of these Hadiths are authentic, but are ambiguous in meaning, and others are Mawquf [a statement of a Companion], like this one. Some of them are clear in meaning; they fall into two categories:\nThe first category is that which is sound and clear in meaning, namely the Hadith of Buraydah (may Allah be pleased with him), “Allah, there is none worthy of worship\xa0 but He, the One, the Eternal Refuge, Who neither begets nor is born…” Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This is more sound in terms of its isnad than everything else that has been narrated concerning that. And it is as he said (may Allah have mercy on him). Ash-Shawkani confirmed that in Tuhfat Adh-Dhakirin (p. 52). It is listed in Sahih Abu Dawud (1341).\nThe second category is those which are clear in meaning but are not sound, some of which Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) clearly stated were inauthentic, such as the Hadith which is quoted to support the third view, which was narrated from `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) in Ibn Majah (3859). It also appears in Da`if Ibn Majah (841). Concerning some other reports he did not say anything, such as the Hadith which is quoted to support the eighth view, namely the Hadith of Mu`adh ibn Jabal (may Allah be pleased with him) in At-Tirmidhi, which is listed in Ad-Da`ifah (no. 4520).\nThere are other Hadiths that are clear in meaning, but Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him did not quote them; however, they are Wahin (flimsy); they are also listed in the same book (nos. 2772, 2773 and 2775). (Silsilat Al-AHadith Ad-Da`ifah wa’l-Mawdu`ah, 13/279)\nThe\xa0 correct view regarding the greatest name of Allah\nPerhaps the view that is most likely of all of them to be correct is the view that the greatest name is “Allah,” because this is the one name which encompasses all the other names and attributes of Allah, may He be Exalted, and it is a name that was never given to anyone other than Allah, may He be Exalted. This is the view of most scholars.\n\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n\n“The name “Allah” is indicative of all the beautiful divine names and sublime attributes…” (Madarij As-Salikin (1/32)\n\nIbn Amir Haj Al-Hanafi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n\n“It was narrated that Muhammad ibn Al-Hasan said: I heard Abu Hanifah (may Allah have mercy on him) say: The greatest name of Allah is “Allah”. This is also the view of At-Tahawi and many of the scholars, and most of the devoted worshippers.” (At-Taqrir wat-Tahbir (1/5)\n\nAbu Al-Baqa’ Al-Fatuhi Al-Hanbali (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n\n“We learn two things:\n\nThe first is that the name “Allah” is a name that refers to His essence and is unique to Him, so it encompasses all of His beautiful names.\nThe second is that it is the greatest name of Allah according to most of the scholars, and is the name that is connected to all praiseworthy attributes.” (Sharh Al-Kawkab Al-Munir, p. 4)\n\n\nAsh-Shirbini Ash-Shafi`i (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n\nAccording to some scholars, it is the greatest name of Allah. It is mentioned in the Glorious Quran in two thousand three hundred and sixty (2360) places.” (Mughni Al-Muhtaj ila Ma`rifat Alfaz Al-Minha j (1/88, 89)\n\nShaykh `Umar Al-Ashqar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n\n“What appears to be the case from comparing the texts in which the greatest name of Allah is mentioned is that this name is “Allah”. This name is the only name which appears in all the texts concerning which the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) stated that the greatest name of Allah is mentioned in them.\nOne of the things which support the opinion that “Allah” is the greatest name is the fact that it is repeated in the Holy Quran 2697 times – according to the list in Al-Mu`jam Al-Mufahras [a famous concordance or index of the Quran] – and it is mentioned in the form “Allahumma” [a vocative form] five times, whereas another divine name which is applicable only to Allah, may He be Exalted – namely Ar-Rahman [the Most Gracious] – is mentioned only fifty-seven times. This idea is also supported by the fact that this name (“Allah”) encompasses many great and significant meanings.” (Al-`Aqidah fi Allah (Belief in Allah), p. 213)\nThe second of these views in terms of strength is the view that the greatest name of Allah is Al-Hayy Al-Qayyum (the Ever-Living, the Sustainer). This is the view of a number of scholars, including An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him), and it was regarded as more likely to be correct by Shaykh Al-`Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him).\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 11278 , 260383 , and 246242 .\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/146569/the-greatest-name-of-allah
475245,"If a worker takes a loan from the boss or the company, is it permissible to agree to cancel the debt and give the employee a lower wage for a while?","['Praise be to Allah.If the employee takes a loan from his work, and there is an agreement that it will be paid back through deductions from his salary, then there are two forms of this agreement, one of which is permissible and the other is not allowed.\nThe first form:\nThis is when the deduction from the salary is equal to what you owe or less than that, then the salary will go back to normal [after the debt has been paid off]. This is permissible, and it may be worked out on the basis of the remaining time of the contract, or by agreeing on the time period within which deductions will be made from the salary. This is one way of paying off the loan if it is done with the consent of both parties.\nIt is as if you are giving permission to the company to deduct something from your salary that you earn as instalments towards paying off the debt. There is nothing wrong with this.\nThe second form:\nThis is when the deduction that is taken from your salary will add up to more than the amount of the debt. This is not permissible, because it becomes a loan that brings a benefit. So it is as if the company loaned you ten thousand, for example, then takes back more than that through deductions from your salary.\nIt is not permissible for the lender to ask for or accept any material or intangible privileges or benefits, or to accept any such thing from the borrower, either before giving the loan or during the period of the loan (before the debt is paid off).\nIt was narrated that Abu Burdah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I came to Madinah and met ‘Abdullah ibn Salaam (may Allah be pleased with him), who said to me: You live in a land where dealing with riba is widespread. If someone owes you something and he gives you a load of hay, or a load of barley, or a load of fodder for free, do not accept it, for it is riba. Narrated by al-Bukhari (3603).\nIbn al-Mundhir said: The scholars were unanimously agreed that in the case of giving a loan, if the lender stipulates that he wants a gift worth one tenth of the loan or more, and he gives the loan on that basis, his taking of the extra amount is riba. End quote from al-Ijma‘ by Ibn al-Mundhir (p. 99).\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It was narrated from more than one of the prominent Sahabah – such as Ubayy, Ibn Mas‘ud, ‘Abdullah ibn Salaam, Ibn ‘Umar and Ibn ‘Abbas – that they forbade the lender to accept any gifts from the borrower, and they regarded accepting it as riba.""(I‘lam al-Muwaqqi‘in\xa04/66).\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said, regarding giving a gift to the lender: If the borrower does that without prior stipulation before paying off the debt, the lender should not accept it, and it is not permissible to accept it unless he gives him a gift in return, or counts it as part of payment for the loan, unless they had the habit of exchanging gifts before the loan. That is because of the report narrated by al-Athram, according to which a man was owed twenty dirhams by a fisherman, who started to give him fish and estimate their value, then when the total reached thirteen dirhams, he asked Ibn ‘Abbas about that, and he said [to the fisherman]: Give him seven dirhams.""(Al-Mughni\xa0\xa06/437).\nAnother issue to pay attention to is if the period for reduction of the salary is unknown, or that reduction is permanent; in that case, this is not permissible, because it is a kind of gambling, which is haram. That is because he may have taken the loan in return for a reduction in his salary, or for giving up his salary for an unknown period, or permanently, and his salary during that period may add up to more than the loan that he took, in which case he will have lost more than what he owed, or it may add up to less than that, in which case he will have gained by not paying the full amount of the debt he owed.

12368,"How can we reconcile between the fact that doctors can find out whether the foetus is male or female, and the verse (interpretation of the meaning): “and [He] knows that which is in the wombs” [Luqman 31:24], and what was narrated in Tafsir Ibn Jareer from Mujahid, that a man asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) what his wife would give birth to, and Allah revealed this verse, and what was narrated from Qatadah (may Allah have mercy on him)? Is there any verse or hadith to make the general meaning of this verse (“what is in the wombs”) more specific?","['Praise be to Allah.Is there any contradiction between an unambiguous statement of the Quran and reality?\nBefore I discuss this matter, I would like to explain that there can never be any contradiction between an unambiguous statement of the Quran and reality. If there appears to be a contradiction with reality, it is either because what we think is reality is a baseless claim, or the (text of) the Quran is not opposed to this reality in a clear and definite manner. The unambiguous statements of the Quran and the facts of reality are both definitive, and two definitive things can never contradict one another.\xa0\nIs gender reveal allowed in Islam?\nBased on the above, it may be said that now they (doctors) are able, through the use of precise machines, to discover what is in the wombs and to find out whether it is male or female . If what is said is false, then there is no point in discussing it. If it is true, then it does not contradict the verse, because the verse is referring to a matter of the unseen, which has to do with the knowledge of Allah about these five matters .\xa0\nThe matters of the unseen as far as the foetus are concerned are: how long he will remain in his mother’s womb, his life, his deeds, his provision, whether he is doomed (destined for Hell) or blessed (destined for Paradise), and – before it is fully formed – whether it will be male or female. But after it has been fully formed, knowledge of whether it is male or female is no longer the matter of the unseen , because once it has been fully formed it becomes the matter of the visible world, but it remains within the three layers of darkness which, if they were removed, it would be known what it is. It is not far-fetched to think that among the things that Allah has created are powerful rays which can penetrate these layers of darkness so that it may become clear whether the foetus is male or female. The verse does not clearly refer to knowledge of whether the foetus is male or female, and the Sunnah does not refer to that either.\xa0\nIs Gender Reveal Part of the Unseen?\nWith regard to what the questioner refers to, that Ibn Jarir (may Allah have mercy on him) quoted from Mujahid (may Allah have mercy on him) that a man asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) what his wife would give birth to, and Allah revealed this verse, this narration is interrupted, because Mujahid (may Allah have mercy on him) was one of the Tabi`in [the generation after the Companions].\xa0\nThe Tafsir of Qatadah (may Allah have mercy on him) may be interpreted as meaning that Allah Alone has knowledge of that so long as it has not yet been fully formed. But once the foetus is fully formed, then others may have knowledge of it.\xa0\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his Tafsir of the verse from Surah Luqman (interpretation of the meaning): “No one knows what Allah wants to create in the wombs apart from Him, but once He decrees that it should be male or female, doomed or blessed, the angels who are appointed in charge of it know that, and whoever else He wills among His creation.”\xa0\nWith regard to your question about what may make the general meaning of this verse (“what is in the wombs”) more specific, we say that if the verse was speaking about being male or female after the foetus is fully formed, then that which would make it more specific would be tangible facts. The scholars have mentioned the principles of making the general meanings of the Quran and Sunnah more specific, which are a text, Ijma` (scholarly consensus), Qiyas (analogy), tangible facts or reason. Their comments on this matter are well known.\xa0\nBut since the verse does not refer to after the foetus is fully formed, but rather it refers to before that time, there is nothing in it that would contradict the idea of knowing whether the foetus is male or female.\xa0\nHow to interpret things that happen which outwardly appear to contradict the Quran\nPraise be to Allah, there is not, and never will be, anything in reality that contradicts the unambiguous statements of the Quran . The accusations made by the enemies of the Muslims against the Quran, that things happen which outwardly appear to contradict the Quran , arise from their misunderstanding of the Book of Allah which stems from their bad intentions. But the committed Muslims and scholars have enough knowledge to discover the truth which will refute the specious arguments of these people. Praise and blessings be to Allah.\xa0\nWith regard to this matter, people may be one of two extremes, or a middle group.\xa0\n\nOne extreme is to adhere to the apparent meaning of Quranic verses which are not unambiguous, and to reject any certain facts that go against it. Such people either expose themselves to criticism, or they expose the Quran to criticism, because their view contradicts the certain realities of everyday life.\xa0\nThe other extreme is to turn away from that which is indicated by the Quran and to adopt a purely materialistic approach. Thus one becomes a heretic.\xa0\nThe middle path is to accept both the indications of the Quran and the facts of reality. These people know that both of them are true, and that the unambiguous statements of the Quran cannot contradict something that is well known and visible. They combine acceptance of the transmitted texts with reason, thus keeping their religious commitment and their intellect safe and sound. Allah guides those who believe to the truth of that wherein they differ, and Allah guides whom He wills to a Straight Path (cf. Al-Baqarah 2:213).\xa0\n\nMay Allah help our believing brothers to achieve that, and may He cause us to be guided and to guide others, and make us righteous leaders. My strength is only in Allah, in Him I put my trust and to Him I turn in repentance.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12368/is-gender-reveal-part-of-the-unseen
