512399,"If I take the voice of a human and put it through an AI program and make it recite the Quran, is that haram or halal? And will it bring reward?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt is not permissible to make voices, or to manipulate them or alter them, except with the permission of their owners, so as to avoid troubles, tampering and upsetting others.\nSomeone may take a person’s voice and manipulate it, making it say evil words or make statements or give instructions in his will, and so on, and that will result in wealth being taken unlawfully and people’s honour being tarnished, resulting in confusion and chaos. Therefore it is not permissible to do that except with the permission of the owners of the voices in question, for permissible purposes which not detrimental to anyone.\nFrom the above, we may conclude that using someone’s voice and making it say things is only permissible when it meets the following conditions:\n\nIt should be done with the permission of the owner of the voice.\nIt should be done for a permissible purpose.\nIt should not lead to any harm.\n\nIf the owner of the voice gives permission for his voice to be used to recite Quran, there is nothing wrong with that.\nSecondly:\nIf someone’s voice is used to recite Quran even though in reality he did not recite it, he will not attain a reward for reciting Quran, but if someone else benefits from this recitation, he will be rewarded for benefitting people and calling them to what is good, because in this case the voice is a tool which is being used for good, and the owner of the voice gave permission for that, so he will have a share in the reward.\nBut if someone gives permission for his voice to be used for haram purposes, such as singing, and it is shared among people, then he will be a partner in that sin.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And cooperate in righteousness and piety, but do not cooperate in sin and transgression. And fear Allah; indeed, Allah is severe in penalty}\xa0[al-Ma’idah 5:3].\nMuslim (2674) narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever calls others to guidance will have a reward like that of those who follow it, without that detracting from their reward in the slightest. And whoever calls others to misguidance will have a burden of sin like that of those who follow it, without it detracting from their burden in the slightest.”\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Sharh Muslim (16/226): Regarding the Prophet’s words “Whoever sets a good precedent… Whoever sets a bad precedent…” and, in the other hadith, “Whoever calls others to guidance… whoever calls others to misguidance…”:\nThese two hadiths clearly indicate that it is recommended (mustahabb) to set good precedents and it is forbidden to set bad precedents, and that whoever sets a good precedent will have a reward like that of everyone who acts upon it until the Day of Resurrection, and whoever sets a bad precedent will have a burden of sin like that of everyone who acts upon it until the Day of Resurrection. The one who calls people to guidance will have a reward like that of those who follow it, and the one who calls people to misguidance will have a burden of sin like that of those who follow it, whether he is the one who started that guidance or misguidance, or someone else did that before him, and whether it involves teaching knowledge, an act of worship, a matter of etiquette or anything else.\nThe Prophet’s words “and it is acted upon after he is gone” mean: if he sets the precedent, whether others act upon it during his lifetime or after his death.

82641,I would like to ask about the rights of the wife in the case of divorce when she has custody. Please note that she is the one who asked for divorce.,"[""Praise be to Allah.Asking for divorce due to husband's shortcomings\nIf a woman has asked for divorce – when her husband has consummated the marriage with her – one of two scenarios must apply:\xa0\n\nEither she has asked for it because of the husband`s shortcomings in fulfilling her rights, or because of some attitude in him that annoys her and deprives her of her rights, or because he has fallen into sin, and other such reasons which make it permissible for her to ask for divorce. The Shar`i judge is the one who should evaluate them and decide whether they are valid reasons or not. If they are valid, then the husband must divorce her by divorce in that case, and give her all her rights in full, which are:\xa0\n\n\nThe full dowry that was agreed upon, both the earlier portion, if any of it is still outstanding, and the delayed portion, because the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If he has consummated the marriage with her, then the mahr is hers because of his intimacy with her.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 1102; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Irwa` Al-Ghalil, 1840)\nReasonable maintenance, including food, drink, accommodation and clothing during the `Iddah period , if it is revocable divorce.\n\nShaykh Salih Al-Fawzan (may Allah preserve him) said:\xa0\n“The woman who has been revocably divorced is still a wife so long as the `Iddah continues, and she is entitled to the same as other wives of maintenance, clothing and accommodation.” (End quote from Al-Mulakhkhas Al-Fiqhi, 2/317)\xa0\nIf the divorce is not revocable, such as a third divorce, then she is not entitled to maintenance or accommodation.\xa0\nMuslim (1480) narrated that Fatimah bint Qays (may Allah be pleased with her) was divorced by her husband for a third time, and she asked the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about what she was entitled to of maintenance. He said:\xa0 “You are not entitled to maintenance or accommodation.”\xa0\nIf she has custody of her children from him, then in that case he must also give her:\xa0\n\nPayment for custody and breastfeeding.\nMaintenance for the children.\n\nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“The mothers shall give suck to their children for two whole years, (that is) for those (parents) who desire to complete the term of suckling, but the father of the child shall bear the cost of the mother`s food and clothing on a reasonable basis. No person shall have a burden laid on him greater than he can bear.” [Al-Baqarah 2:233]\xa0\nSo Allah has made it obligatory for the father of the child to spend on the mother who breastfeeds her child. This includes the woman who is pregnant or divorced; the father must pay for maintenance. (End quote from Tafsir As-Sa`di, p. 105).\xa0\nShaykh Muhammad ibn Salih Al-`Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“The woman who is thrice-divorced is not entitled to maintenance from her husband for herself, but he should spend on her for the sake of the pregnancy. On that basis, whatever she needs of maintenance because of the pregnancy, the husband must provide it, and after the delivery, he should pay for the breastfeeding and clothing and the like of the child, but he is not obliged to provide the mother’s food after the delivery. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \xa0\n“And if they are pregnant, then spend on them till they lay down their burden” [Al-Talaq 65:6].” (End quote from Liqa`at Al-Bab Al-Maftuh, 147/question no. 8)\xa0\nIt says in Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah (17/311):\xa0\n“The Shafi`is and Hanbalis are of the view that the woman who has custody is entitled to demand payment for custody, whether the woman with custody is the mother or someone else, because custody is not obligatory for the mother, and if she refuses custody it should not be forced upon her, generally speaking.” (End quote)\nSetting the amount of payment and maintenance should be referred to the judge.\xa0\nIt is not permissible for the husband to put pressure on his wife so that she will give up any of the rights mentioned above.\xa0\nAsking for divorce for no reason\n\nThe second scenario is where the woman asks for divorce from the husband with no cause. In that case the husband may ask her to return the dowry that he gave her, in return for divorcing her. This is what is called Khul` .\xa0\n\nIn this case, the four rights mentioned above no longer remain, except payment for breastfeeding and custody, and maintenance of the child who is still being breastfed.\xa0\n`Abd Ar-Razzaq narrated in Al-Musannaf (4/90) that Ash-Sha`bi was asked about the woman who is divorced by Khul` – is she entitled to maintenance?\xa0\nHe said: How can he spend on her when he takes from her?\xa0\nBecause if the Khul` is done, the husband cannot take her back, so she is like one who is irrevocably divorced, and is not entitled to maintenance.\xa0\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“The irrevocably divorced woman (unless she is pregnant) is not entitled to maintenance or accommodation according to the authentic Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him); indeed this is in accordance with the Book of Allah and is what is implied by analogy and it is the view of the scholars of Hadith.” (End quote from I`lam Al-Muwaqqi`in, 3/378)\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/82641/rights-of-women-after-divorce-in-islam
434462,"What is the benefit of a woman’s emotions, other than the benefit that her children gain from that, and her being merciful and compassionate towards them?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nEmotions, feelings and the compassionate side of humans: all of that is one of the greatest blessings that Allah has bestowed on humankind. Were it not for that, we would be like robots, in which case life would have no meaning, blessings would have no meaning and nothing would have any meaning. You would feel no joy, no happiness, no mercy, no compassion, no sympathy and no care for others; you would not forgive others or overlook their mistakes. In fact, you would not feel any grief or pain, and you would not feel pleased or angry.\nAll these feelings, even grief and anger, play an essential role in the soul of the human being and in his entire life.\nHence the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would get angry if the sacred limits of Allah were transgressed. Were it not for feelings of anger, he would not have been able to do that which reflected his faith (namely his righteous anger in this instance).\nSecondly:\nEmotions make life colourful and give it meaning. Emotions are an essential part of our lives, and from them we acquire some important information about ourselves. They are essential to our survival, because they are what enable us to determine what is safe for others and what is dangerous.\nThe one who reflects on people’s emotions will find that emotions are not all the same. Each emotion has several components which may vary in importance; they are seen in a person’s feelings, behaviour and choice of friends, and also in different social contexts in which emotional responses are provoked.\nThirdly:\nIt seems from the question that you affirm the benefit of a woman’s emotions, through which a mother shows mercy and compassion towards her child, and feels love for him. But this in fact highlights to us the more important matter, which is ignored with regard to the benefit of emotions, for emotions are an essential means of showing mercy and compassion to ourselves, being kind to ourselves and being able to handle our feelings and emotions, so that we will be able to manage our mental state and behaviour properly. All of that will lead a person to develop what he requires of characteristics through which he will become a slave of Allah and closer to Him. There is nothing that Allah has given us but it has a role to play in helping us to become true slaves of Allah.\nHow could we love Allah, if we had no feelings of love?\nHow could we give thanks to Allah, if we had no feelings of gratitude?\nHow could we become angry when the sacred limits of Allah are transgressed, if we had no feelings of anger?\nHow could we show mercy to others, if we had no kind and gentle feelings? For the one who does not show mercy will not be shown mercy.\nAllah has created the woman to have feelings and emotions which balance out the man’s logical and practical approach to life, so that he will find comfort in her despite her gentleness and weakness, when he has power and strength: {It is He Who created you from a single soul, and created from it its mate, so that he might find comfort in her} [Al-A‘raf 7:189].\nIn general, human emotions are an inseparable part of a person’s makeup, which help him to go through the journey of life, worshipping his Lord. Female emotions in particular are part of a woman’s makeup which qualify her to be the gentle breeze that brings comfort to life, so as to show one aspect of servitude to Allah in which various branches of faith are manifested, which do not manifest themselves in this way but you will find that in women.\nThe Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) spoke the truth when he said of Khadijah (may Allah be pleased with her): “I was blessed with her love.” Narrated by Muslim (2435).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/434462/what-is-the-benefit-of-a-womans-emotions
146675,"I pray quickly, i.e., I recite Surat Al-Fatihah and other short Surahs quickly, and my movements during the prayer are also fast. Is this permissible or not?","['Praise be to Allah.Shaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him)\xa0 said:\nSignificance of Measured Recitation in Islam\nThe Sunnah is for the one who is reciting to recite at a measured pace (Tartil) and not to rush, so that he may ponder and think about what he is reciting, whether it is Al-Fatihah or something else. The Sunnah is to ponder, think and recite at a measured pace, not to rush. Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n{And recite the Quran (aloud) in a slow, (pleasant tone and) style.} [Al-Muzzammil 73:4]\xa0\n{(This is) a Book (the Quran) which We have sent down to you, full of blessings, that they may ponder over its Verses, and that men of understanding may remember.} [Sad 38:29]\xa0\nReading so fast that some letters or verses are not pronounced properly is not permissible; rather the worshipper should recite slowly and not be hasty, so that the recitation will be correct and clear, and he can ponder and think about (what he is reciting).\xa0\nIf he omits or changes some of the letters, this is a kind of recitation that is not permissible. Rather he has to recite carefully and at a measured pace, so that the letters and words are pronounced in full.\xa0\nIs praying fast prohibited?\nThe same applies to prayer, he should not rush when bowing or prostrating, or when sitting between the two prostrations, or when standing after bowing. Rather he should move with deliberation and calmly . This is what is required. Moving calmly is an essential obligation; “pecking” and moving hastily in prayer invalidates the prayer.\xa0\nRecommended supplications during prayer\nWe advise the questioner to move carefully and calmly when bowing, and not to rush; he should say Subhana Rabbiya Al-`AdhIim three or more times, and he should say: Subhanaka Allahumma wa bi hamdika, Allahumma ighfir li (Glory be to You, O Allah, and praise; O Allah, forgive me). When he raises his head from bowing he should settle into the standing posture and say: Rabbana wa lakal-hamd, hamdan kathiran tayyiban mubarakan fihi mil’a As-Samawati wa mil’a Al-Ard wa mil’a ma baynahuma wa mil’a ma shi’ta min shay’in ba`d (Our Lord, to You be praise, much good and blessed praise, filling the heavens, filling the earth, filling what is between them and filling whatever You will besides). This is what is best for him.\xa0\nSaying Rabbana wa lakal-hamd is obligatory according to the correct opinion. If he completes it by saying hamdan kathiran tayyiban mubarakan fihi mil’a As-Samawati wa mil’a Al-Ard wa mil’a ma baynahuma wa mil’a ma shi’ta min shay’in ba`d, that is more complete and better.\xa0\nAnd some extra words were narrated from the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “Ahl Ath-thana’ wal-majd, ahaqqu ma qala Al-`abd, wa kulluna laka `abd, la mani` lima a`tayta wa la mu`ti lima mana`ta, wa la yanfa`u dhal-jaddi minka Al-jadd (You are the One Who most deserves praise and glorification, (this is) the soundest thing a slave could say, and we are all Your slaves; none can withhold what You give, and none can give what You withhold, and the good fortune of any fortunate person is to no avail against You). This is perfection of praise.\xa0\nSimilarly when prostrating, he should not rush, and he should prostrate on the seven parts: the forehead, the nose, the hands, the knees and the toes; he should settle in the posture and not rush, and he should say Subhan Rabbi Al-A`la, Subhan Rabbi Al-A`la, Subhan Rabbi Al-A`la, subhanaka Allahumma wa bi hamdika Allahumma ighfir li (Glory be to my Lord Most High. Glory be to my Lord Most High, Glory be to my Lord Most High, Glory be to You, O Allah, and praise, O Allah, forgive me).\xa0\nHe should offer whatever supplication he can, and say: Allahumma ighfir li dhanbi kullahu diqqahu wa jullahu, awwalahu wa akhirahu, `alaniyatahu wa sirrahu (O Allah, forgive me all my sins, small and great, first and last, open and secret). This is a prescribed Du`a.\xa0\nAnd the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The closest a person is to his Lord is when he is prostrating, so offer a lot of Du`a then.” And he said: “As for prostration, strive hard in supplication, because it is more likely that you may receive a response.”\xa0\nThe proper way to prostrate and sit in prayer\nThe believer should not rush when prostrating; rather he has to settle in the position, as this is one of the essential parts of prayer and is necessary. Yet it is prescribed not to pause too long (in any position) and not to rush, and he should offer Du`a whilst prostrating and repeat the words Subhana Rabbiya Al-A`la. What is obligatory is to say it once, but repeating it three or five or seven times is better.\xa0\nBetween the two prostrations he should also settle in the posture and not rush. He should sit up between the two prostrations until every vertebra returns to its place, and he should say, Rabb ighfir li, Rabb ighfir li, Rabb ighfir li, Allahumma ighfir li warhamni wahdini wajburni warzuqni wa `afini (Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me, O Allah forgive me, have mercy on me, guide me, comfort me, grant me provision, and grant me well being).\xa0\nAll of that was narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and the Muslim should follow the example of his Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and do as he did, and he should not be hasty in such matters, for prayer is the foundation of Islam and prayer is an important matter.\xa0\nStriving for excellence in prayer\nSo we advise the questioner to pay attention to this matter and to fear Allah and remember that He is always watching; he should do his prayer at a measured pace, and not rush. Similarly, his recitation should be slow and careful, and not rushed; rather he should recite clearly, pondering and thinking about (what he is reciting), and try to benefit from it. We ask Allah to help and guide us all.
