491457,"I have a friend whose mother likes me and she feels that her son is no longer good, and she asks me about him, and I tell her the truth about what he does. But I have another friend who said that I am causing trouble, and that what I am doing is wrong. I would like to ask you to give a ruling on what I am doing: am I causing trouble or not?","['Praise be to Allah.Islam urges the Muslim to look for righteous friends who will help him to carry out his religious duties and remain steadfast in that, because this is one of the means that help a person to follow the path of righteousness and remain steadfast in adhering to the truth. Having righteous friends is one of the greatest means that helps the Muslim to remain steadfast in his faith. It was narrated from Abu Musa that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The believers (in their mutual support) are like a structure, parts of which support other parts” – and he interlaced his fingers. Narrated by al-Bukhari (467).\nMusa (peace be upon him) sought righteous company, even though he was a prophet:\n{And appoint for me a helper from my family,\nHarun, my brother.\nStrengthen me through him,\nand let him share in my task,\nso that we may glorify You much\nand remember You much}\xa0[Ta-Ha 20:29-34].\nAccording to the hadith narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “A man will follow the way of his close friend, so let one of you look at who he takes as a close friend.” Narrated by Abu Dawud (4833); classed as sahih by al-Albani.\nOne of the factors that facilitate sincerity in friendship, love and companionship is when each person is very keen to make sure that his friend is in the best state in terms of religious commitment and manners. This is why it is prescribed to choose righteous and sincere friends and companions. This is a crucial element of true brotherhood and is one of the foundations thereof.\nIt was narrated that Jarir ibn ‘Abdillah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I swore allegiance to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) pledging to establish prayer, give zakah and show sincerity to every Muslim. Narrated by al-Bukhari (57).\nSo if a person sees his brother or friend misbehaving, he must advise him and correct him, and keep him away from the places and means that may make him fall into that bad conduct.\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is important to get together with one’s brothers in order to cooperate in attaining means of salvation, exhort one another to hold fast to the truth and exhort one another to hold fast to patience. That is one of the greatest means of attaining success. Al-Fawa’id (1/71).\nBased on that, it is your duty towards your friend to create a good environment that will enable you both to carry out your religious duties, help you both to avoid sin and protect you both from drifting away.\nSo if you see your friend making a mistake or doing something wrong, then the first step – as we have mentioned above – is to advise him, correct him, help him to do good, divert him from what is wrong and evil, warn him against it, and warn him of the bad consequences of his misbehaviour and the danger of having bad friends.\nSecondly:\nIf he does not respond to advice, then there are two scenarios regarding the way to deal with the situation:\n-1-\nIf his mistakes are rare slips, there is no need to tell his family, so as to maintain the good relationship between you, and because the basic principle is to conceal the mistakes of one’s fellow Muslim. Your important role is to continue to be a friend who tries to help him to do good, and strives to correct his friend’s behaviour and advise him. This is the benefit of being a good brother and a good friend.\n-2-\nIf these mistakes become habitual and you are not able to turn him away from this misbehaviour, then in that case you should tell his family about it, so that it does not become ingrained behaviour or lead to persistent decline and drifting away from the straight path.\nThat is because covering up for him in this case would lead to the problem becoming worse and his persisting in wrongdoing without anyone intervening to stop him and correct him. This comes under the heading of enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong, by means of which social conduct may be corrected.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/491457/should-he-tell-his-friends-family-about-his-misdeeds
200862,"I was born into a sunni family. And by hearing lot of speeches and looking to this site i found that the most of sunnis belief are bid'ah in some of them r form of Shirk. I introduce d matter. Manqooz moulid has been widely spread book in kerala which every one read at their home for fulfilling their need. But there are some group in kerala called salafis tell that manqooz molood contain many Shirk lines. One of such lines is as follows; ""irthakkab'thu alalkhatha..
Khaira has'rin va adadin…
laka ashkoo fi hiya…
sayyidee khairan nabee…""
is there any Shirk in above line..? Reading it should be haram..?
Pls help me to protect our deen..? U will get great reward from allah if u make me clear about this so that i cn tell it to everyone.. There may be so many grammer mistake. So U can change this question to understandable form..","['Praise be to Allah.Review of the book `Manqoos Moulid’\nThe book referred to is a book of myths, fables, Shirk and innovation. The author wrote it to give evidence, falsely, that it is Islamically prescribed to celebrate the Prophet’s birthday and to exaggerate about the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and to seek his help and ask of him – and other Prophets and righteous people – besides Allah. Hence it is full of falsehoods, fabricated Hadiths and strange stories. If we were to examine it and critique it, it would take a very long time. Almost every single line of it requires some comment and refutation.\xa0\nAmong these lies and fabrications is what he (falsely) attributes to Imam Abu Hanifah (may Allah have mercy on him), saying that he used to seek the help of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and ask him besides Allah, saying:\n“O Master of masters, I have come to you, hoping that you will be pleased with me and will offer me your protection.\nBy Allah, O Best of creation, I have a heart that is longing for you and does not want anyone but you.\nBy your virtue, I am in love with you, and Allah knows how much I love you.\nO you who are the best of the two races (mankind and the jinn), bestow on me your generosity; I am happy if you are pleased with me.\nI am hoping for your generosity, as Abu Hanifah has no one else in this world but you.”\xa0\nThen he says that Imam Ash-Shafi`i (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“The family of the Prophet are my means to reach Him and they would lead me to Him.\nI hope by virtue of them that I will be given my record in my right hand on the Day of Resurrection.”\xa0\nThis is undoubtedly a lie about these two great imams who affirmed the Oneness of Allah. Otherwise, let him prove that from them with sound chains of narration going back to them, or even a weak chain of narration via which such a report could be transmitted. But they can never do that!\xa0\nThe polytheistic material narrated in this book includes the following:\xa0\n“It should be noted that seeking help from the beloved ones of Allah, may He be Exalted, such as the Prophets, the Awliya’ (close friends of Allah) and the righteous is permissible during their lifetimes and after their deaths…\xa0\n“… Thus it is known that it is permissible to seek help by saying `O Messenger of Allah, help me’ or `O Ghawth (source of help), O Muhiy Ad-Din `Abd Al-Qadir Al-Jilani and so on.”\xa0\nAnother example of this polytheistic material that is contained in this book is that which is mentioned by the questioner, “artakabtu Al-khataya, laka ashku ya sidi ya khayr an-nabiyyin (I have committed sins, I complain to you, O my master, O best of the Prophets).”\nThis comes under the heading of major polytheism, because repentance from sins can only be to Allah alone, and complaining about the consequences of sins and their impact can only be done to Allah alone.\xa0\nIn the answer to question no. 179363, we explained that the words (interpretation of the meaning): {If they (hypocrites), when they had been unjust to themselves, had come to you (Muhammad blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)…} [An-Nisa’ 4:64] were applicable only during the lifetime of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and not after his death.\xa0\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“This verse encouraged the Ummah to come to him if they had been unjust to themselves (or wronged themselves) by committing sin or falling into that which was more serious than that, namely Shirk. They were to come to him, repentant and regretting what they had done, so that he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) could pray for forgiveness for them. What was meant by that coming was coming to him (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) when he was still alive. Coming to him after his death for this purpose is not permissible. The evidence for that is the fact that the Companions and those who had deep knowledge of Islam did not do that, and because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not have the power to do that after he died.” (End quote from Majmu` Fatawa Ibn Baz, 6/189-190)\xa0\nCan you ask the Prophet for help?\nCalling upon the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and asking of him besides Allah, and seeking his help, is a major Shirk that puts one beyond the pale of Islam, so how about seeking the help of anyone other than him?\xa0\nThe scholars of the Standing Committee said:\xa0\n“Calling upon the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and seeking his help after his death to meet one’s needs or relieve one of distress is major Shirk that puts one beyond the pale of Islam.” (End quote from Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 1/473)\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Calling upon the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) or any lesser person is Shirk and misguidance, because these people cannot respond. What one must do is repent to Allah from this Shirk and not call upon anyone except Allah. We all know that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) himself did not possess any power to bring benefit or cause harm, except by the will of Allah. Allah, may He be Exalted, instructed him to declare that to his Ummah, as Allah said to him (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Say (O Muhammad blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): `I possess no power of benefit or hurt to myself except as Allah wills. If I had the knowledge of the Ghaib (unseen), I should have secured for myself an abundance of wealth, and no evil should have touched me. I am but a warner, and a bringer of glad tidings unto people who believe.} [Al-A`raf 7:188]\n{Say (O Muhammad blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): `I don’t tell you that with me are the treasures of Allah, nor (that) I know the unseen; nor I tell you that I am an angel. I but follow what is revealed to me by inspiration’.} [Al-An`am 6:50]\nThe Messenger himself used to pray to Allah , may He be Glorified, seeking forgiveness and mercy for himself, and for his companions. If he had been able to grant forgiveness to anyone or bestow mercy on him, he would not have needed to pray to Allah, may He be Glorified, for that. But all of creation is in need of Allah, and it is Allah alone Who is Free of all wants and needs, Worthy of all praise, as He, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {O mankind! it is you who stand in need of Allah, but Allah is Rich (Free of all wants and needs), Worthy of all praise} [Fatir 35:15]. Were it not for the devils toying with the minds of these people they would realise that the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and others do not possess any power to benefit or harm anyone, and they would call upon Allah alone, with no partner or associate: {Is not He (better than your gods) Who responds to the distressed one, when he calls Him, and Who removes the evil, and makes you inheritors of the earth, generations after generations. Is there any god with Allah?} [An-Naml 27:62]” (End quote from Majmu` Fatawa wa Rasa’il Al-`Uthaymin, 21/218-219)\xa0\nThe point is that complaining about one’s situation and one’s sin, admitting it and repenting from it to any human being, or seeking help and aid from him, comes under the heading of Shirk or ascribing partners to Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted. Indeed it comes under the heading of pure acts of worship which it is not permissible to devote to any except Allah, may He be Exalted.\xa0\nIn Sahih Muslim (2577) it is narrated that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said, narrating from his Lord, may He be blessed and Exalted: “ `O My slaves, all of you are astray except those whom I guide, so ask Me for guidance, and I will guide you. O My slaves, all of you are hungry except those whom I feed, so ask me for food and I will feed you. O My slaves, all of you are naked except those whom I clothe, so ask Me for clothing and I will clothe you. O My slaves, you err night and day, but I forgive all sins, so ask Me for forgiveness and I will forgive you.’”\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“With regard to that which no one but Allah, may He be Exalted, is able to do, it is not permissible to seek it from anyone except Allah, may He be Glorified; it should not be sought from the angels or from the Prophets or from anyone else. It is not permissible to say to anyone other than Allah: `Forgive me’ or `Grant us rain or `Grant us victory over the disbelieving people’ or `Guide our hearts’ and so on. Hence At-Tabarani narrated in his Majma` that at the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) there was a hypocrite who used to annoy the believers, so they said: Let us go and seek the help of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) against this hypocrite. So they came to him and he said: “Help should not be sought from me; rather it should be sought from Allah.” (End quote from Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 1/329)\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/200862/can-you-ask-the-prophet-for-help
127933,"In the hadith “No one of you believes until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself,” is what is meant that the person is a disbeliever – even if he believes in the Qur’an and Sunnah – until he loves his brothers? Or is what is meant that his faith is not complete? I hope you can explain.","['Praise be to Allah.With regard to the negation of faith in Quranic verses and Hadiths, sometimes what is meant is that the person is not a believer at all, so the person is a disbeliever, and sometimes what is meant is that the person does not have complete faith; thus he is basically a believer, so he is not a disbeliever, but he is lacking in faith.\nThe Hadith asked about is of the second type.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhat it means is that his faith is not complete, otherwise one who has not attained this characteristic is still basically a believer. (End quote from Sharh Muslim, 2/16)\nAl-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhat is meant is that his faith has not reached the perfect level until, in addition to his being a Muslim, people are safe from his harm, he wants good for them and he is sincere towards all of them in his dealings with them. (End quote from Al-Mufhim lima Ashkala min Talkhis Sahih Muslim, 1/224).\nHe also said:\nThat is: his faith is not complete, because the one who deceives a Muslim and is not sincere towards him is committing a major sin, but he does not become a disbeliever as a result, as we have explained more than once.\nBased on that, what the Hadith means is that the one who is described as having perfect faith is the one who is sincere in his dealings with people, so he wants for them what he wants for himself and dislikes for them what he dislikes for himself. (End quote from Al-Mufhim, 1/227).\nWhat indicates that what is meant by the negation of faith in this Hadith is negation of complete faith is the fact that the version of this Hadith narrated by Ibn Hibban says: “No one can attain true faith until he loves for people what he loves for himself of good.” (Al-Albani classed it as authentic in Sahih At-Targhib, 1780).\nAl-Hafidh Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhat is meant by the negation of faith is that the person has not attained complete faith…\nIbn Hibban stated – based on a report of Ibn Abu `Adiy from Husayn Al-Mu`allim – that in the Hadith “No one can attain true faith,” what is meant by “true faith” is complete faith, which means that the one who does not attain this characteristic does not become a disbeliever. (End quote from Fat-h Al-Bari, 1/57).\nIbn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“No one can attain true faith until he loves for people what he loves for himself of good” – this version explains the meaning of the version that is narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim, and demonstrates that what is meant by the negation of faith is that the individual has not attained true or ultimate faith. Faith is often negated because it is lacking some of its essential or obligatory parts, as when the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “No adulterer is a believer at the time when he is committing adultery; no thief is a believer at the time when he is stealing; no drinker of wine is a believer at the time when he is drinking it” and “He does not believe, whose neighbour is not safe from his evil conduct.” (End quote from Jami` Al-`Ulum wal-Hikam, 120)\nWhat is meant by the negation of faith here is the lack of complete faith that is obligatory. So the one who does not love for his brother what he loves for himself is falling short in the faith that is required of him and is committing something that is prohibited, for which he deserves punishment.\nAl-Hafidh Ibn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhen the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said that the one who does not love for his brother what he loves for himself does not truly believe, this indicates that this is one of the characteristics of faith and, in fact, is one of the obligations thereof, for faith cannot be negated unless one of its obligations is not being met, as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said elsewhere: “No adulterer is a believer at the time when he is committing adultery…” Rather a man can only love for his brother what he loves for himself when he is free of envy, rancour, deceit and resentment, and that is something that is obligatory.

228366,"What is the ruling on listening to Surat Al-Mulk, which will save one from the punishment of the grave, before going to sleep, for one who does not know how to read the Quran? Will the reward for that be equal to the reward of one who recites it?","['Praise be to Allah.Virtues of Surat Al-Mulk\nConcerning the virtue of Surat Al-Mulk , it was narrated by At-Tirmidhi (2891) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There is a Surah of the Quran, thirty verses long, which will intercede for a man until he is forgiven. It is the Surah [which begins with the words] ‘Tabaarak alladhi bi yadihi’l-mulk… (Blessed is He in whose hand is dominion…).’” (Classed as sound by Shaykh Al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) in Sahih Sunan At-Tirmidhi)\nAt-Tirmidhi also narrated from Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would not go to sleep until he had recited “Alif, Lam, Mim. [This is] the revelation of the Book” [Surat As-Sajdah ] and “Tabarak alladhi bi yadihi’l-mulk… (Blessed is He in whose hand is dominion…)” [Surat Al-Mulk] (Classed as authentic by Shaykh Al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him))\nAn-Nasa’i (10479) narrated that Ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “Whoever recites ‘Tabarak alladhi bi yadihi’l-mulk… (Blessed is He in whose hand is dominion…)’ [Surat Al-Mulk] every night, Allah will protect him [mana‘ahu] thereby from the punishment of the grave. At the time of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), we used to call it Al-maani‘ah (the protector). It is a Surah in the Book of Allah which, whoever recites it every night, he will have done a great deal and done well.” (Classed as sound by Shaykh Al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) in Sahih At-Targhib wat-Tarhib.)\nThe point – as is the apparent meaning of the Hadiths – is that the virtue mentioned is only attained by the one who recites that Surah.\nWill you be rewarded for listening to Surat Al-Mulk before sleeping?\nWith regard to simply listening, without reading, the one who does that is not regarded as reciting or reading Surat Al-Mulk , even though listening to it is a prescribed act of worship and is something that is required. But he will not necessarily attain the same reward and virtue as the one who reads it. We do not know of any evidence to suggest any basis for regarding the acts as equal.\nBased on that, whoever wants to attain the virtue mentioned in the Hadiths has to read the Surah; it is not sufficient simply to listen to it.\nIf he cannot read it, then he can repeat after the reciter, especially since it is easy to listen via various means. There are recorded recitations that allow the listener to repeat after the reciter. If he is able to do that, then that is better, in sha Allah, and by doing that he will actually have read or recited it, and perhaps he will attain a greater reward for his patience in putting up with the hardship involved in that.\nWhoever is not able to do any of that, or it is too difficult for him, so he only listens to what he is able to, then we hope that he will not be deprived of the reward of one who reads or recites, or the virtues narrated about reciting such Surahs, if he does what he is able to.\nFor more details, please refer to the following answers: 72591 , 75894 , 90186 , and 2241\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/228366/ruling-on-listening-to-surat-al-mulk-before-sleeping
