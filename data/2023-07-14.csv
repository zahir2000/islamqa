238718,"If a man kept his marriage to his second wife secret, and had children with her, then he died without having disclosed this secret to his parents and siblings, or to his first wife and her children, then how can the second wife and her children seek their rightful share of the estate?","['Praise be to Allah.In a number of questions we have stated that it is obligatory to officially register marriages, because that will protect people’s rights so that they will not be lost.\nPlease see the answer to question no. 129851 .\nBut a man may be forced to forego registering a marriage because he lives in a western country where plural marriage is not allowed and the one who does that will be penalised. In that case, we may say:\nIf the husband married a second wife in accordance with Islamic teachings, then it is easy for the second wife and her children to prove that, because when she got married there must have been her guardian and two men – at least – who acted as witnesses or he must have announced the marriage to some of his friends or relatives.\nThe husband may have left behind something in his handwriting confirming this second marriage, or he may have registered his children from his second wife in his name, and so on.\nSo the second wife should take some of these witnesses and whatever proof or other circumstantial evidence she has to prove the validity of her claim, and present it to those in charge of the Islamic centre in her city, and they can present it to the family of the deceased and prove to them that there are other parties who have rights in this regard, and they are entitled to their share of the estate.\nThe first wife of the deceased and her children must accept that, and beware of cutting off ties of kinship and refuse to give what rightfully belongs to their brothers, because Allah has ordained that all wives and all children have rights to the estate, so there should be no differentiation between one wife and another, or between one son and another. They are all children of the deceased and are all entitled to their share of the inheritance. The prohibition [on denying them their rights] is further emphasized if any of the heirs are minors (orphans), because devouring the wealth of orphans is a major sin for which the one who does that deserves punishment in hell.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Indeed, those who devour the property of orphans unjustly are only consuming into their bellies fire. And they will be burned in a Blaze}\xa0[an-Nisa’ 4:10].\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/238718/how-can-the-second-wife-prove-her-marriage-after-her-husband-dies-as-the-marriage-was-not-officially-registered
261068,"When I got married, a list of movable items was written as the first part of the dowry, half of which was gold that was actually bought, and the other half is furniture that was not actually bought. This is exactly the same as my sister’s dowry, but what was added to her list was what my father gave her of furniture and gold. Now divorce has taken place through the court. Am I entitled to claim the value of the listed furniture at today’s price, or at the price when the list was drawn up?","['Praise be to Allah.The custom in Egypt is to write a list (qa’imah) of movable items which is regarded as part of the dowry. There is nothing wrong with this, so long as that is the custom.\nWith regard to the question asked by the questioner, the furniture that was written in the list but was not actually bought is to be regarded as the deferred part of the dowry.\nWhen divorce occurs, the husband is obliged to return this exact furniture, according to the way it is described in the list of movable items, and according to what is appropriate for a woman of similar standing to his wife, if there is any dispute about some of the details. It is not permissible to force him to pay its value, unless he agrees to that.\nBased on that:\nThe husband must return this furniture, or he must buy it and deliver it to the wife.\nIf the wife wants to receive its value instead and the husband agrees to that, then they must agree on the value that he will pay.\nUndoubtedly it is in the interests of both parties to agree on a value, and work out a deal regarding what the husband should pay in that regard. It is not in the wife’s interests, if divorce occurs, that the husband should buy her new furniture instead of what is written in the list, because that will be a burden on him and the harm to him will be greater than any benefit she gets, as she will never be able to sell it except at a loss and lower price, as is well known.\nIt is also not in the husband’s interest to be difficult and stubborn with regard to giving her her dues, or to go to the trouble of buying the furniture and so on, so as to avoid giving her her dues in cash; rather this is a kind of causing harm and is poor conduct on his part.\nTherefore they should both agree and work out a deal regarding this issue. The wife may give up her right to the value of the furniture at today’s price, and he should not be difficult and stubborn in dealing with her and he should not try to cause her harm.\nIf they cannot reach an agreement, they should go back to the original deal, which is that he should deliver the furniture – and not its value – to her. They can appoint someone who is religiously committed and fair-minded, and who also has experience, to arbitrate and put an end to the dispute between them.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/261068/what-was-written-in-the-list-of-movable-items-but-not-actually-bought-is-regarded-as-part-of-the-deferred-dowry
