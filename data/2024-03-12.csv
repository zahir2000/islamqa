406460,1. Is it kufr to throw a paper on which the name of the mother of ‘Issa is written?,"['Praise be to Allah.\nFirstly:\nIt is prohibited to throw a paper containing the name of a prophet from the prophets into impurity, or to throw it in a manner of insult and belittlement in other than impurity, and this act is considered disbelief.\nIt is stated in ""Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah"" (14/59): ""It is obligatory to protect the books of exegesis, Hadith, and Islamic sciences from being treated with disrespect.\nWhoever throws a paper containing something from Islamic knowledge, or containing the Name of Allah, or the name of a prophet, or an angel into impurity, or smears it with impurity - even if it is overlooked (a small quantity) - is judged as a disbeliever, if it is proven that he intended to insult the Shari`ah.""\nSecondly:\nIt is prohibited to show disrespect (to the name) if the intention is to refer to the prophet by\xa0the name, such as by accompanying it with ""peace be upon him,"" or if the context of the speech indicates that intention.\nHowever, if the name refers to a person other than the prophet, then it is not prohibited to disrespect it, such as if the person\'s name is `Isa (Jesus) or Muhammad or Ibrahim.\nAd-Dusuqi said: ""Like throwing the Quran, which is apostasy: throwing the Names of Allah, etc., and the names of the prophets, if that is with the intention of belittling and making light of them; by way of throwing them because they are the name of a prophet.\nAnd his saying: \'and the names of the prophets\' means: those accompanied by what indicates that, such as: \'peace and blessings be upon him\'y."" This is the end of the statement from ""Hashiyat Ad-Dusuqi"" (4/301).\nAs-Sawi said: ""His saying: [and the Names of Allah]: meaning: and the names of the prophets if it is with the intention of belittling and making light of them, where they are specified with a description that distinguishes them, like Muhammad the Messenger of Allah, or accompanied by prayer."" This is the end of the statement from ""Hashiyat As-Sawi on Ash-Sharh As-Saghir"" (4/433).\nTherefore, it is not prohibited to throw away a paper which has Christian or Christopher written on it - if it means Christian - because this has become a name for the person belonging to Christianity, not meant to mention the name of `Isa (Jesus) peace be upon him.\nThirdly:\nAs for Maryam, she is not a prophet, so it is disliked to throw papers with her name on them, as it is disliked to throw the names of the Companions, and it is prohibited if it is with the intention of disrespect.\nIbn Al-Hajj Al-Maliki, (may Allah have mercy on him)\xa0said: ""It is common among some craftsmen in this time that they use paper without knowing what is in it.\nAnd this is not permissible; because it may contain the Noble Quran, or a Hadith of the Prophet\'name (peace and blessings be upon him)\xa0or a name from the names of the angels or the prophets (peace be upon them).\nWhatever is of that nature, it is not permissible to use it, nor to disrespect it; out of sanctity for it and reverence for its status.\nIf it (paper) contains the names of scholars or the righteous predecessors - may Allah be pleased with them - or the Islamic sciences, then it is disliked, and it does not reach the level of prohibition like the one before it.""\nThis is the end of the statement from ""Al-Madkhal"" (4/89).\nWe asked our Sheikh Abdul Rahman Al-Barrak (may Allah preserve him)\xa0about throwing papers in the trash while they contain the name of a Companion\xa0and he said: ""If the intention is not to insult: then it is not prohibited.""

220647,"I heard that Allah, may He be Exalted, divided Ramadan into three parts: the first ten days of it are mercy, the second ten days are forgiveness and the third ten days are ransom from the fire. It is said that there are specific aDu`asfor each part, so in the first part we say: Allahumm arhamni ya arham ar-rahimeen (O Allah, have mercy on me, O most merciful of those who show mercy); in the second part we say Allahumm ighfir li ya Rabb Al-`Alameen (O Allah forgive me, O Lord of the Worlds); and in the third part we say Allahumm a`tiqni min an-nar wa adkhilni Al-Jannah (O Allah, ransom me from the Fire and admit me to Paradise). Is this correct and is there any evidence for it? What are the Du`a`s that should be recited a great deal in Ramadan? To the best of my knowledge, Allahumma innaka `afuwwun tuhibb Al-`afwa fa`affu `anni (O Allah, You are forgiving and You love forgiveness, so forgive me) is one of the Du`a`s that should be repeated often in the last ten days, when seeking Laylat Al-Qadr. What about the other days of Ramadan? Are there any specific Du`a`s for them?","['Praise be to Allah.Is Ramadan divided into three parts?\nIbn Khuzaymah (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated in his Sahih (1887) that Salman (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) addressed us on the last day of Sha`ban and said: “O people, a great month has come upon you, a blessed month… It is a month the beginning of which is mercy, its middle is forgiveness and its end is ransom from the Fire.”\xa0\nIn the answer to question no.\xa021364 , we explained that this Hadith isinauthentic. \xa0\nThe entire month of Ramadan is mercy from Allah; the entire month is also forgiveness and ransom from the Fire. None of these blessings is restricted to any one part of the month to the exclusion of any other part, and this is a reflection of the vastness of Allah`s mercy.\xa0\nMuslim (1079) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When Ramadan comes, the gates of Paradise are opened and the gates of Hell are closed, and the devils are fettered.”\xa0\nAt-Tirmidhi (682) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When the first night of Ramadan comes, the devils and mischievous jinn are chained up, and the gates of Hell are closed, and none of its gates are opened. The gates of Paradise are opened and none of its gates are closed. And a caller cries out: `O seeker of good, proceed; O seeker of evil, desist.` And Allah has people whom He frees (from the Fire), and that happens every day.” (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Tirmidhi)\xa0\nBased on that, singling out the first third of Ramadan to pray for mercy , the second third to pray for forgiveness and the last third to pray for ransom from Hell is an innovation for which there is no basis in Islamic teachings. There is also no justification for singling out these times for these supplications, because all the days of Ramadan are equal in that regard. Rather the Muslim may pray for whatever he wants of goodness in this world and the hereafter throughout Ramadan; that includes asking Allah for mercy, forgiveness, ransom from the Fire and admission to Paradise.\xa0\nThe recommendation to make a lot of Du`a in Ramadan\nThe Muslim should offer a great deal of Du`a, asking for goodness and mercy, especially in this month, making the most of this time of goodness and blessing (Barakah), seeking the mercy and forgiveness of their Lord, may He be Exalted. Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And when My slaves ask you (O Muhammad blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) concerning Me, then (answer them), I am indeed near (to them by My Knowledge). I respond to the invocations of the supplicant when he calls on Me (without any mediator or intercessor). So let them obey Me and believe in Me, so that they may be led aright.”\xa0[Al-Baqarah 2:186]\xa0\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“The fact that Allah, may He be Exalted, mentions this verse, which encourages one to offer Du`a, in the midst of the verses that speak of the rulings on fasting, indicates that one should strive hard in offering Du`a at the end of the fast and, indeed, every time one breaks the fast.”\xa0(Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 1/509)\xa0\nExamples of Du`as in Ramadan\nIt is good for the one who offers Du`a to follow proper etiquette and to recite many of the Du`as that have been narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and not to overstep the mark in offering Du`a. He should observe the etiquette of Du`a and recite often the Du`as that it is recommended to recite a great deal in Ramadan and also at times other than Ramadan. These include the following:\xa0\n\n\xa0“Rabbana atina fi`d-dunya hasanah wa fi`l-akhirah hasanah wa qina `adhab An-nar (Our Lord, give us that which is good in this world and that which is good in the Hereafter, and protect us from the torment of the Fire),” [Al-Baqarah 2:201]\n“Rabbana hab lana min azwajina wa dhurriyyatina qurrata a`yunin waj`alna lil-muttaqina imama (Our Lord! Bestow on us from our wives and our offspring who will be the comfort of our eyes, and make us leaders for the Muttaqun (the pious))” [Al-Furqan 25:74].\n“Rabb ij`alni muqima as-salati wa min dhurriyyati Rabbana wa taqabbal Du`a. Rabbana ighfir li wa li walidayya wa lil-mu`minina yawma yaqum ul-hisab (O my Lord! Make me one who performs As-Salat (Iqamat-as-Salat), and (also) from my offspring, our Lord! And accept my invocation. Our Lord! Forgive me and my parents, and (all) the believers on the Day when the reckoning will be established).” [Ibrahim 14:40-41]\nAllahumma innaka `afuwwun tuhibb Al-`afwa fa`affu `anni (O Allah, You are forgiving and You love forgiveness, so forgive me).\nAllahumma inni as`aluka min Al-khayri kullihi `ajilihi wa ajilihi, ma `alimtu minhu wa ma lam a`lam, wa a`udhu bika min ash-sharri kullihi `ajilihi wa ajilihi, ma `alimtu minhu wa ma lam a`lam.

O Allah, verily I ask you for Paradise and that which will bring me nearer to it of words and deeds, and I seek refuge with You from Hell and that which would bring me nearer to it of words and deeds.

O Allah, protect me from before me and from behind me, from my right and from my left, and from above me, and I seek refuge in Your greatness lest I be destroyed from beneath me).\n\nSimilarly, it is recommended to recite general Du`as from the Quran and Sunnah, any Du`a is good in which the individual strives hard, beseeching his Lord. None of that is limited to Ramadan only.\xa0\nIt is also recommended to say after breaking the fast: “Dhahaba Adh-dhama` wa abtalat Al-`uruq wa thabata Al-ajr in sha Allah (Thirst is gone, the veins are moistened and the reward is certain if Allah wills).”\nPlease see also the answer to question no.\xa014103 \xa0and\xa026879 .\xa0\nOne should strive hard in Du`a in the last third of the night in particular, every night.\xa0\nDuring the last ten days, one should recite a great deal the words: “Allahumma innaka `afuwwan tuhibb ul-`afwa fa`fu `anni (O Allah, You are forgiving and love forgiveness, so forgive me).”\nPlease see the answer to question no.\xa036832 .\xa0\nPlease see the answer to question no.\xa036902 \xa0for more information on the etiquette of Du`a.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/220647/is-there-a-specific-dua-for-each-day-and-night-of-ramadan
153791,"Is it acceptable to do Wudu without rinsing the mouth and nose, because the Quranic verse does not go into details; rather it speaks of generalities, i.e., washing the face?","['Praise be to Allah.The scholars differed concerning the ruling on rinsing the mouth and nose in Wudu and ghusl . The correct scholarly view is that these actions are obligatory, and Wudu or ghusl is not valid without them, because they are included in washing the face which is enjoined in the Quranic verse.\xa0\nAl-Hajjawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Az-Zad, in Bab Furud Al-Wudu wa Sifatuhu (The obligatory parts of Wudu and its description), p. 29:\xa0\n“The obligatory parts (of Wudu) are six: Washing the face – of which the mouth and nose are part; washing the hands; wiping the head – of which the ears are part; washing the feet up to the ankles; doing these actions in order; and doing them continuously , without interruption , which means not delaying the washing of one part until the part before it has dried.”\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Ash-Sharh:\xa0\n“The words “of which the mouth and nose are part” mean they are part of the face, because they are located on the face, so they are included with it. Based on this, rinsing the mouth and nose are among the obligatory parts of Wudu, but they are not separate (rather they are included with the face). This is similar to the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “I have been commanded to prostrate on seven bones: the forehead – and he pointed to his nose…” (Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti‘, 1/119)\xa0\nThe scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas said:\xa0\n“Rinsing the mouth and nose in Wudu is proven from the actions and words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and they are included in washing the face. So Wudu is not valid if they are omitted or if one of them is omitted.” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 4/78) (See also Al-Mughni by Ibn Qudamah, 1/83)\xa0\nThe fact that the verse does not explicitly mention rinsing the mouth and nose does not mean that they are not obligatory, because the Sunnah explains the Quran, and the Sunnah teaches us that we should rinse the mouth and nose. It is not narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that he omitted one or both of them in Wudu. This is an explanation of the command mentioned in the Quran to wash the face when purifying oneself.\xa0\nSo if a person omits rinsing the mouth and nose when purifying himself, his purification is not valid, whether he did that deliberately or by mistake.\xa0\nThe scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas said:\xa0\n“If a person forgets to wash any of the parts of the body that should be washed when doing Wudu, or he omits any portion of that, even if it is small, if it was during Wudu or immediately afterwards and the traces of water are still on his limbs and have not dried yet, then he should wash the part that he forgot and those that come after it only. But if he remembers that he forgot to wash one of the parts of the body that are to be washed in Wudu, or a portion of it, after his limbs have dried or during the prayer or after finishing the prayer, then he has to do Wudu all over again, just as Allah has prescribed repeating the prayer in full. Allah has enjoined washing all the parts of the body that are to be washed in Wudu, so if a person omits part of that, even if it is a small area on one of the parts that are to be washed in Wudu, it is as if he forgot to wash all of it. This is what is indicated in the report narrated by `Umar ibn Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) saw a man doing Wudu, and he omitted a spot the size of a fingernail on his foot. He told him to repeat his Wudu and his prayer, and he went back and prayed again. (Narrated by Muslim, 243 and Ibn Majah, 666)” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 4/92)\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/153791/is-it-obligatory-to-rinse-the-mouth-and-nose-in-wudu
351838,It's a fact that only Allah know the unseen but I'm a little bit confused regarding the fact that some people see stuff happening in there dreams which comes true later or some people seeing jannah in there dreams and hell and etc,"['Praise be to Allah.No one knows the true unseen except Allah, may He be exalted, but He may disclose to some of His slaves some matters of the unseen, either through the angel, or through a true dream, or through inspiration, or by speaking directly to him.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{He knows what is [presently] before them and what will be after them, and they encompass not a thing of His knowledge except for what He wills}\xa0[Al-Baqarah 2:255]\n{[He is] Knower of the unseen, and He does not disclose His [knowledge of the] unseen to anyone,\nExcept whom He has approved of messengers}\xa0[Al-Jinn 72:26-27].\n-1-\nPart of the unseen of which Allah informed His prophets through the angel is knowledge of what will happen of the portents of the Hour; the description of the gathering, the reckoning and the sirat (bridge over Hell); and many of the details of Paradise and Hell.\n-2-\nPart of the unseen of which Allah informs His slaves through a true dream is when a person sees what is going to happen to him or to someone else in the future, then it happens as he saw it. So he may see that So-and-so is going to die, or that he is going to get married to So-and-so, or that he will have a child, and the like.\nThis is part of the unseen which Allah discloses to some of His slaves. Hence true dreams are a part of prophecy.\nAl-Bukhari (6989) narrated from Abu Sa‘id al-Khudri that he heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “True dreams are one of the forty-six parts of prophecy.”\nMuslim (8) also narrated it from Abu Hurayrah.\nWhat is meant by true dreams being one of the parts of prophecy is that the word nubuwwah (prophecy, prophethood) is taken from the words naba’ and ianba’, which refer to informing. What is meant is that the dream is true foretelling from Allah, and there is no lie in it. Similarly, the word nubuwwah refers to true foretelling from Allah, Who cannot lie. Hence dreams are similar to prophecy in the sense that what is foretold about the unseen is true.""(Sharh Sahih al-Bukhari by Ibn Battal\xa0 9/517).\nSo if someone sees in his dream something of the future unseen, then it comes to pass as he saw it, this means that Allah has blessed him with knowing something of the unseen that no one knows except Him, may He be glorified, and He has told us that He may disclose it to some of His slaves.\n-3-\nAllah may inform His slave of some matter of the unseen by means of inspiration, as al-Bukhari (3469) and Muslim (2398) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Among the nations that came before you there were men who were inspired. If there are any among my ummah who are inspired, then ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab is among them.”\nAccording to a mu‘allaq report narrated by al-Bukhari (3689), “Among those of the Children of Israel who came before you there were some men who were spoken to without them being prophets; if there is anyone among my ummah who could be one of them, it is ‘Umar.”\nAl-Khattabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “if there is anyone among my ummah who could be one of them, it is ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him)” – the one who is inspired is the one into whose heart something is cast, so it is as if he is told about it; something occurs to him and it happens to him, or something crosses his mind and it comes to pass. This is a high status of the awliya’ (those friends of llah) and a lofty status among those who are brought close to Allah.""(\xa0A‘lam al-Hadith\xa0 3/1571).\nAn example of that is when Allah inspired the mother of Musa (peace be upon him): Throw him into the river; he will be saved and will be one of the messengers. Allah called this inspiration wahy, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And We inspired [wa awhayna] to the mother of Moses, “Suckle him; but when you fear for him, cast him into the river and do not fear and do not grieve. Indeed, We will return him to you and will make him [one] of the messengers”}\xa0[al-Qasas 28:7].\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This wahy (inspiration) is for people other than the prophets; it may happen when they are awake or when they are asleep, and it may happen with an audible voice or a voice that is in the person’s heart, not coming from outside himself, when awake or when asleep.(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa\xa012/398).\n-4-\nAllah may inform His Messenger about the unseen by speaking to him directly, as happened to a number of the prophets, including our Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on the night of the Mi‘raj (ascent to heaven).\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{ And it is not for any human being that Allah should speak to him except by revelation or from behind a partition or that He sends a messenger to reveal, by His permission, what He wills. Indeed, He is Most High and Wise}\xa0[Ash-Shura 42:51].\nThese are four ways in which Allah may inform some of His slaves about the unseen, one of which is dreams. So a person may see something of the future, then it comes to pass as he saw it, or Allah may cause him to see Paradise or Hell.\nAt the end of time, true dreams will increase and will bring some glad tidings, and the truthfulness of the dreams will be indicative of the sincerity of the one who sees the dream, as Ahmad (10590), Abu Dawud (5019), at-Tirmidhi (2270), and Ibn Majah (3917) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), who said: “Towards the end of time, a Muslim’s dream will hardly be false and the truest of them in dreams will be the truest of them in speech. The dream of the Muslim is one of the forty-six parts of prophecy.” And he said: “Dreams are of three types: good dreams, which are glad tidings from Allah; another type of dream, which comes from the Shaytan and is intended to make him sad; and dreams that come from what a person is thinking of to himself. If one of you sees something that he dislikes, let him not tell anyone about it, and let him get up and pray.”\nClassed as sahih by al-Albani and Shu‘ayb al-Arna’ut, who said: [Sahih] according to the conditions of al-Bukhari and Muslim.\nMay Allah grant us and you true dreams.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/351838/does-seeing-matters-of-the-unseen-in-a-dream-contradict-the-fact-that-only-allah-knows-the-unseen

If the delay in prayer is for a reason which will not cause one to miss its prescribed time, then it is permissible to delay it; if it will cause one to miss the time, it is prohibited. If continuing to study means that the prayer will be done outside of the proper time, then it is not permissible for the student to do that, and he must offer the prayer on time.
