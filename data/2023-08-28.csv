394812,"One of my classmates in college said, a few months ago, “He is going to cause us to become disbelievers,” meaning that the professor is so harsh that he will make us lose our faith and become disbelievers [this is a colloquial Arabic expression]. Has he become a disbeliever because of saying that?","['Praise be to Allah.If a person says “So and so is going to cause us to become disbelievers”, what he means is that that person will push us to do that because of his bad attitude or raising doubts and the like.\nThat person does not become a disbeliever because of saying that, because he is speaking about something in the future that has not happened.\nBut saying such a thing is abhorrent in all circumstances, because disbelief (kufr) is not a matter to be taken so lightly that a person could fall into it because of some annoyance he is faced with. Using this phrase is indicative of a lack of religious commitment, and demonstrates that the issue of falling into disbelief is something that the speaker takes lightly.\nWhat we must do is be wary of slips of the titonguee. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Man does not utter any word except that with him is an observer prepared [to record]}\xa0[Qaf 50:18].\nAnd the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “A person may say a word which displeases Allah, thinking little of it, for which he will be thrown down into Hell.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (6478) and Muslim (2988).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/394812/ruling-on-saying-so-and-so-is-going-to-cause-us-to-become-disbelievers
130943,"What is the ruling on calling people by names of Allah such as Karim, ‘Aziz and so on?","['Praise be to Allah.Calling people by the names of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, falls into two categories.\nThe first category is divided into two types:\nThe first type is where the name is preceded by the definite article al-. In this case, no one may be called by this name except Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, such as if anyone were to be called al-‘Aziz, as-Sayyid, al-Hakim, and so on. No one can be called by these names except Allah, because the definite article al- in this case indicates that what is referred to is the divine name.\nThe second type is where the name is chosen for its divine meaning, but is not preceded with the definite article al-. In this case, such names should not be used. It is for this reason that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) changed the kunyah of Abu’l-Hakam, because the latter’s companions used to refer to him for judgement. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Indeed it is Allah Who is al-Hakam [the Judge], and He is the One to judge.” Then he gave him a kunyah using the name of his oldest son, Shurayh [so he became known as Abu Shurayh]. This indicates that if someone is named by one of the names of Allah, intending the meaning of that divine name, this is not allowed, because in that case the name is exactly the same as the name of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. The names of Allah, may He be exalted, are names and attributes, with divine meanings.\nThe second category is names that are not preceded by the definite article, and the intention is not to refer to the divine meaning. In this case, there is nothing wrong with these names, such as Hakim (wise). The name of one of the Sahabah was Hakim ibn Hizam, to whom the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not sell what you do not possess.” This indicates that if the intention is not to connect it to the meaning of the divine name or attribute, there is nothing wrong with it.\nBut names such as Jabbar should not be used, even if the intention is not to connect it to the meaning of the divine name or attribute, because the name may have some impact on the person who is so named, so that he may become tyrannical or arrogant or think that he is above other people. Such things may have an impact on a person, so they should be avoided. And Allah knows best.
