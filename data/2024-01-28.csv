148923,"I have Muslim teachers, but they do not wear hijab, and one of them is Shi‘i. I want to advise them and give them some Islamic books… Would that be considered to be bribery? Allah knows that my intention has nothing to do with bribery at all. As that is the case, how can I call them to wear hijab and follow the path of our Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)? On one occasion I spoke with my Shi‘i teacher and she liked what I said. She said: “Ma sha Allah, you have knowledge!” But she also told me: “I have lived all my life as a Shi‘i; my parents brought me up in this way. Thank you for talking to me anyway.” And the conversation with her ended. But I want to do more; I want to explain things to her and give her books so that she could follow the path of the Sunnah. What do you advise me to do?","['Praise be to Allah.We ask Allah to make you steadfast in guidance and to help you to speak the truth and tell others about it, and to fulfil the duty of calling people to Allah on the basis of knowledge, seeking His pleasure.\nYou should understand that your advising these teachers, telling them what is right and warning them about what is wrong is a noble action for which you deserve to be praised. So we ask Allah to help you to do it and to increase you in guidance and faith, and to benefit you and benefit others through you.\nWith regard to giving them Islamic books, it is better not to do that, so as to err on the side of caution. It is also better to keep away from an action that could resemble a bribe or have an impact on them at a time when they have some authority over you, as they are in charge of your education, and it could make them favour you when giving grades and so on, because people have a natural inclination towards those who do them favours.\nYou can avoid that by making the books that you give to them a loan, so that one of them can read it, then give it back to you. This is more prudent and will absolve you of any wrongdoing. Moreover, it may be more beneficial, because you can guarantee that the teacher will read it, and it is possible that this exchange will lead to a discussion between you and the teacher, so that you can talk with her about the content of the book.\nIf you want to give her a book, then keep that book with you for now, until you finish your time in school. Then before you move on to the next stage, or she returns to her country, you can give her whatever you want to of gifts, if she is no longer in charge of your education and no longer has any authority over you.\nOr someone else, another righteous sister who is involved in calling people to Allah, could help you in this matter, so as to avoid any dubious situation.\nPlease see also the answer\xa0to question\xa0no. 82386 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/148923/is-it-permissible-for-a-student-to-give-religious-books-to-her-teachers-who-are-not-practising-to-call-them-to-allah
132608,"With all due respect to the one who answered question no. 21365 about the two verses (no. 106, 107) of Surah Hud, you stated that the people of Hell will abide therein forever and ever and will never come out of it. However, I read in Sahih Al-Bukhari (Book 2, 12, 72) that Allah will show mercy to some of the people of Hell and will admit them to Paradise because of what there is in their hearts of faith in Him. Which of the two is more correct? If both are correct, how can we reconcile between them? Based on that, do the verses in Surah Hud indicate that some of those who do good deeds will remain for a similar period in Paradise but in the end they will enter Hell? If that is not the case, then how will these disbelievers who spend their lives in the service of humanity then die in non-Muslim countries – like Mother Teresa – be rewarded?","['Praise be to Allah.We appreciate the questioner’s interest in the answers that we publish on our website and his following up on them. We also appreciate his question about the apparent contradiction, which is indicative of his love of learning and his efforts to benefit from what he reads, in sha Allah.\xa0\nTypes of people in Hell\nThere is no contradiction between what is mentioned in the answer to the question referred to, and the Hadiths referred to in the question. To explain further, the people of Hell are of two types:\xa0\n\nThe first type are monotheists (people who affirmed the Oneness of Allah) who mixed good deeds with bad deeds. Allah will admit them to Hell for their sins, and He has willed that they should be punished there.\xa0\n\nThis category will be punished in Hell for a while, and Allah, may He be Exalted, is the One Who will determine the length thereof. Then He will bring them out of the Fire and will decree that they will abide for eternity in Paradise after that.\xa0\nThese are the ones referred to in the Hadiths mentioned in the question, in which it is stated that some of those who are in the Fire will be brought out because of what they believe in of Tawhid (the Oneness of Allah). They are the people of Hell among the Muslims.\xa0\n\nThe second type are the disbelievers and hypocrites who do not have any belief in Tawhid and who die in a state of disbelief, Shirk (polytheism), atheism or hypocrisy.\xa0\n\nThis category will be punished in Hell for eternity. Their Lord warned them that they would abide in Hell for eternity if they did not do what Allah, may He be Exalted, commanded them to do of affirming His Oneness (Tawhid) and devoting all their acts of worship\xa0 to Him alone. They chose for themselves Kufr (disbelief) and they chose to abide for eternity in the Fire.\xa0\nThese are the ones who are referred to in the verses of Surah Hud referred to at the beginning of your question.\xa0\nWho will go to Hell?\nFrom what we have mentioned above, you will realise that being admitted to Hell is not just for one group; rather it is for two groups, one of which will be brought out of it. They are the monotheists (believers in Tawhid, the Oneness of Allah) who committed sins that meant that they deserved to enter Hell. The other group will not be brought out of it; those are the ones who disbelieved and died in a state of disbelief.\xa0\nCan You Get Kicked out of Jannah?\nWith regard to Paradise, none will enter it except one group, namely the monotheists (believers in Tawhid). When a person enters it, he will never exit from it; rather he will enjoy what it contains, and he will never feel sorrow or despair, he will never die or fall sick, he will never grow old or be deprived of that delight after he has tasted it.\xa0\nOnce you understand that there are two categories of people, those who believe and those who disbelieve, those who are blessed (destined for Paradise) and those who are doomed (destined for Hell), then you will be able to understand what is mentioned in the Book of Allah, may He be Exalted, of the decree that there will be no exit from Hell, and that those who are referred to in this case are the disbelievers who will abide in Hell forever, as Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Thus Allah will show them their deeds as regrets for them. And they will never get out of the Fire.” [Al-Baqarah 2:167]\n“They will long to get out of the Fire, but never will they get out therefrom, and theirs will be a lasting torment.” [Al-Ma’idah 5:37]\xa0\nWith regard to those who are blessed (destined for Paradise) and the people of faith, Allah, may He be Exalted, has decreed that they will not exit from Paradise , as He, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“No sense of fatigue shall touch them, nor shall they (ever) be asked to leave it.” [Al-Hijr 15:48].\xa0\nFor more information, please see the answers to questions no.\xa031174 ,\xa026792 \xa0and\xa045804\nWill disbelievers enter Jannah?\nOnce this is understood clearly, it should be noted that if the disbeliever does something that is deserving of reward, he will be rewarded for it in this world , not in the Hereafter. His disbelief prevents his deed being accepted in such a way that he may benefit from it in the Hereafter, because one of the conditions of good deeds being accepted is that one should be Muslim.\xa0\nAt-Tabari (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\nIf a person does a righteous deed without fearing Allah – i.e., he is a Mushrik or polytheist – he will be given a reward for that in this world, such as if he upholds ties of kinship, gives to one who is in need out of compassion, and other such righteous deeds. Allah will give him the reward of his good deed in this world, such as increasing his livelihood and provision, giving him joy in what He blesses him with, warding off from him the harms of this world, and so on. But he will not have any share (of reward) in the Hereafter.\xa0\nTafsir At-Tabari, 15/265\xa0\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Al-Qadi ‘Iyad said: There is scholarly consensus that the deeds of the disbelievers will not benefit them [in the Hereafter]; they will not be rewarded for them with joy and no punishment will be reduced for them, even though some of them will be more severely punished than others.” (Al-Fath, 9/48)\xa0\nIt should be understood that Allah, may He be Exalted, will not cause the reward for their deeds that benefit people to be lost; but their reward will come in this world and not in the Hereafter. As for the believer, the reward for his good deeds will be in this world and in the Hereafter.\xa0\nAnas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If the disbeliever does a good deed, he is fed because of it in this world. As for the believer, Allah stores up his good deeds for him in the Hereafter and grants him provision in accordance with his obedience in this world.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2808)\xa0\nAccording to another report, “Allah does not treat the believer unjustly with regard to his good deeds. He blesses him because of them in this world and He will reward him for them in the Hereafter. As for the disbeliever, he is fed because of the good deeds that he does for the sake of Allah in this world, then when he passes on into the Hereafter, he will have no good deeds left for which to be rewarded.”\nYou should understand that this reward in this world is not definite; rather it is subject to the Will of Allah. Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “Whoever wishes for the quick-passing (transitory enjoyment of this world), We readily grant him what We will for whom We like.” [Al-Isra’ 18:18]\xa0\nAsh-Shanqiti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“It should be understood that this matter, for which we have quoted evidence from the Quran and Sunnah, that the disbeliever may benefit from his righteous deeds in this world, such as honouring his parents, upholding ties of kinship, honouring guests and neighbours, relieving people of distress and so on – all of that is subject to the Will of Allah, may He be Exalted, as He has stated in the verse (interpretation of the meaning): “Whoever wishes for the quick-passing (transitory enjoyment of this world), We readily grant him what We will for whom We like.” [Al-Isra’ 18:18]\xa0\nThis verse is specific and specifies what is mentioned in general terms in other verses and Hadiths.” (Adwa’ Al-Bayan, 3/450)\xa0\nWhat we have mentioned about Allah, may He be Exalted, rewarding whomever He wills among the disbelievers does not apply to Mother Teresa, whose original name was Anjezë Gonxhe Bojaxhiu. She originally came from Macedonia and died in 1997 CE. She was a missionary nun whose work focused on helping the poor, destitute and sick, and she used her work to try to convert them to Christianity. The deeds of a person like this cannot be called “good” and whatever provision he or she gets in this world is not the reward of good deeds; rather it is provision that is granted by Allah, for which those who disbelieve in Him will be punished, as Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And (remember) when Ibrahim (Abraham) said, ‘My Lord, make this city (Makkah) a place of security and provide its people with fruits, such of them as believe in Allah and the Last Day.’ He (Allah) answered: ‘As for him who disbelieves, I shall leave him in contentment for a while, then I shall compel him to the torment of the Fire, and worst indeed is that destination!’.” [Al-Baqarah 2:126].\xa0\nTypes of the deeds of the disbelievers\nTo sum up, the deeds of the disbelievers in this world are of two types:\xa0\n\nWorldly deeds such as acts of kindness, in which it is not stipulated that one should have the intention of drawing close to Allah, such as upholding ties of kinship, honouring guests, and so on. This is what is referred to in the Hadith, for which the disbeliever will be rewarded in this world if Allah wants to reward him.\xa0\n\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“It is clearly stated in this Hadith that (the disbeliever) is fed in this world because of what he does of good deeds, i.e., what he does seeking thereby to draw closer to Allah of actions in which their validity does not depend on the intention, such as upholding ties of kinship, giving charity, manumitting slaves, hosting guests, and other good deeds.”\xa0(Sharh Muslim, 17/150)\xa0\n\nWorldly deeds, in which the doer’s intention is to spread his religion and mislead Muslims away from their religion. These are not included in the Hadith; rather the sternest warning is given to the one who does them, because he is turning people away from the religion of Allah and exploiting people’s needs, poverty and sickness for this evil purpose. That includes what Mother Teresa and other missionaries and promoters of falsehood are doing.\xa0\n\nWith regard to religious actions in which it is stipulated that one should have the intention of drawing close to Allah, such as Hajj, `Umrah and du`a (supplication), the disbeliever will not be rewarded for these either in this world or in the Hereafter , because it is invalid, as some of the conditions of its being accepted are not present, i.e., being Muslim, being sincere towards Allah alone, and following (the Sunnah). Moreover, disbelief renders good deeds invalid, so the one who does them will not benefit from them at all on the Day of Resurrection.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/132608/can-anyone-get-expelled-from-jannah
477478,"“Subhan alladhi yusabbih ur-ra‘du bi hamdihi wa’l-mala’ikatu min kheefatihi (Glory be to the One Whom the thunder glorifies and praises, and the angels [also glorify Him] out of fear and awe of Him.” Should we repeat this dhikr if the thunder is continuous, or is it sufficient to say it once only?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThere is no proven report from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that he used to say this dhikr when hearing thunder. Rather it was narrated with a sound isnad from ‘Abdullah ibn az-Zubayr (may Allah be pleased with him) that if he heard thunder, he would stop speaking and say: “Subhan alladhi yusabbih ur-ra‘du bi hamdihi wa’l-mala’ikatu min kheefatihi (Glory be to the One Whom the thunder glorifies and praises, and the angels [also glorify Him] out of fear and awe of Him.” Then he would say: This [thunder] is a stern warning to the people of the earth.\nNarrated by al-Bukhari in al-Adab al-Mufrad (723) and Malik in al-Muwatta’ (3641). Its isnad was classed as sahih by an-Nawawi in al-Adhkar (235) and al-Albani in Sahih al-Adab al-Mufrad (556).\nIt was also narrated from others among the Sahabah.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: They narrated from Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: We were with ‘Umar on a journey and suddenly there was thunder, lightning and hail. Ka‘b said to us: Whoever says three times when he hears thunder “Subhan alladhi yusabbih ur-ra‘du bi hamdihi wa’l-mala’ikatu min kheefatihi (Glory be to the One Whom the thunder glorifies and praises, and the angels [also glorify Him] out of fear and awe of Him” will be protected from that thunder. We said it and we were protected.""(Al-Adhkar by an-Nawawi\xa0 p. 181).\nIbn ‘Allan said: al-Hafiz said: This isnad is hasan and mawquf [meaning that it stops at the Sahabi]. Even though it was narrated from Ka‘b, Ibn ‘Abbas and ‘Umar approved of it, which indicates that it has a basis. \xa0\nEnd quote from al-Futuhat ar-Rabbaniyyah ‘ala al-Adhkar an-Nawawiyyah (4/286).\nHence it is recommended (mustahabb) to say this dhikr when hearing thunder.\nIt was narrated in a marfu‘ report from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that when he heard the sound of thunder and lightning, he would say: “Allahumma la taqtulna bi ghadabika wa la tuhlikna bi ‘adhabika, wa ‘afina qabla dhalika (O Allah, do not kill us with Your wrath and do not destroy us with Your punishment and protect us before that).”\nNarrated by at-Tirmidhi (3450), who said: This is a gharib hadith; we only know it through this isnad. It was classed as da‘if (weak) by an-Nawawi in al-Adhkar (p. 181) and by al-Albani in Da‘if at-Tirmidhi (3694).\nEven though this hadith is da‘if, as at-Tirmidhi himself said, when it comes to the hadiths that encourage virtuous deeds in general, and supplications (du‘a’s) in particular, the matter is flexible, and the scholars usually took a lenient approach towards their isnads.\nIn al-Mustadrak it was narrated that ‘Abd ar-Rahman ibn Mahdi said: If we narrated a report from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that speaks about what is halal and haram, or about rulings, we are strict in examining its isnad and its narrators. But if we narrate hadiths that speak of the virtue of various deeds, reward and punishment, permissible matters and supplications, we are lenient in examining their isnads.\nAl-Mustadrak ‘ala as-Sahihayn (1/666).\nAl-Qadi Abu Ya‘la (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated from Imam Ahmad that he said: When we narrate [reports] from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that speak of halal and haram, we are very stringent in examining the isnads. But when we narrate reports from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that speak of the virtue of various deeds and reports that do not affirm or abrogate a ruling, we are lenient in examining the isnads.""(Tabaqat al-Hanabilah\xa01/425).\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: We have previously noted that the scholars are agreed that one may act on a da‘if hadith that speaks of righteous deeds, but not matters of halal and haram.""(Al-Majmu‘ Sharh al-Muhadhdhab\xa0 3/248).\nAl-Hattab said: Even though this is da‘if, the scholars are agreed that it is permissible to act in accordance with a da‘if hadith that speaks of the virtue of a particular deed.""(Mawahib al-Jalil\xa0 1/17).\nIbn Hajar al-Haytami (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The scholars are unanimously agreed that it is permissible to act in accordance with a da‘if hadith that speaks of the virtue of a deed, because if it turns out to be sahih, then the one who accepted it will have acted as is required, and if it does not turn out to be sahih, there will be no negative consequences for having acted upon it, such as making something haram halal and vice versa, and there will be no transgression against the rights of others.""(Al-Fath al-Mubin bi Sharh al-Arba‘in\xa0 p. 109).\nThe claim that there is unanimous scholarly agreement on this issue is not accurate, as we have stated previously that the scholars differed in the conditions that they stipulated for acting in accordance with a da‘if hadith (question no. 44877 ).\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: When it comes to hadiths in which there is some weakness, it is either due to a narrator whose memory was poor, or a narrator who has committed some mischief, or other, similar reasons for which it was said that his hadith is da‘if. A da‘if hadith may be quoted by scholars in the context of encouraging people to do righteous deeds that are established and well-known in Islamic teachings, such as the da‘if hadiths that speak of giving charity, because charity is something that is well-known in Islamic teachings, there are verses of the Quran which highlight the importance of charity, and there are sahih hadiths which speak about it. So if there are some da‘if hadiths which speak about the virtue of charity, the scholars quote them. The same applies if there are da‘if hadiths which speak about the virtue of supererogatory (nafil) prayers, or about the virtue of tasbih (saying Subhan Allah (Glory be to Allah)) and tahlil (saying La ilaha illa Allah (there is no god worthy of worship except Allah)), and of dhikr. All these matters are established and well-known in Islamic teachings, so the scholars may be lenient regarding da‘if hadiths that speak of them, because the original deeds of which the da‘if hadiths speak are rooted in the Quran and Sunnah, and because acts of worship that are mentioned in da‘if hadiths are already well known from the Quran and Sunnah.""(shaykh’s website).\nSecondly:\nWith regard to the issue of repeating the dhikr mentioned in the question – “Subhan alladhi yusabbih ur-ra‘du bi hamdihi ...” –\nIt is clear from the action of Ka‘b and the approval of ‘Umar and Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them all) that he used to say it three times.\nAnd it is proven from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that it is recommended to repeat supplications three times. When he offered supplication, he would say it three times, and when he asked of Allah, he would ask three times.\nBased on that, if this dhikr is repeated three times, that is good.\nIf he repeats it every time he hears thunder, what appears to be the case is that there is nothing wrong with that, as it is proven that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would sometimes repeat a supplication more than three times. It was narrated that Jarir ibn ‘Abdillah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) blessed the horses of (the tribe of) Ahmas and their men five times. Al-Bukhari (4099).\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This indicates that he used to repeat supplications an odd number of times, and he sometimes repeated them more than three times. This is an exception to the general meaning of the words of Anas, “When he offered supplication, he would repeat it three times.” That is to be understood as referring to what he usually did, and when he said it more than three times, there must have been a reason which dictated that he should say it more than three times. This is clear in the case of the tribe of Ahmas, because of their efforts in standing up to disbelief and supporting Islam, especially with regard to their own people to whom they belonged.""(Fath al-Bari by Ibn Hajar\xa0 8/73-74).\nSo if there is a reason for repeating it, such as if the reason for saying the dhikr is repeated, then there is nothing wrong with repeating it.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/477478/should-the-supplication-for-hearing-thunder-be-repeated-if-the-thunder-is-continuous
10843,Can we call people who do Shirk and Bid`ah Muslims?,"['Praise be to Allah.This question involves two issues, Bid`ah (innovation) and Shirk (polytheism, association of others with Allah).\xa0\n\nBid`ah\n\nThis issue may be divided into three topics:\n\nDefinition of Bid`ah\nCategories of Bid`ah\nRulings on one who commits Bid`ah – does that make him a disbeliever or not?\xa0\n\nWhat is Bid`ah?\nShaykh Muhammad ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“According to Shari`ah, the definition of Bid`ah is `Worshipping Allah in ways that Allah has not prescribed.’ If you wish you may say, `Worshipping Allah in ways that are not those of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) or his rightly guided Caliphs.’”\xa0\nThe first definition is taken from the verse (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Or have they partners with Allah (false gods) who have instituted for them a religion which Allah has not ordained?”\xa0 [Ash-Shura 42:21]\xa0\nThe second definition is taken from the Hadith of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), who said:\n“I urge you to adhere to my way (Sunnah) and the way of the rightly-guided Caliphs who come after me. Hold fast to it and bite onto it with your eyeteeth [i.e., cling firmly to it], and beware of newly-invented matters.”\xa0\nSo everyone who worships Allah in a manner that Allah has not prescribed or in a manner that is not in accordance with the way of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) or his rightly-guided Caliphs, is an innovator, whether that innovated worship has to do with the names and attributes of Allah, or to do with His rulings and laws.\xa0\nWith regard to ordinary matters of habit and custom, these are not called Bid`ah (innovation) in Islam, even though they may be described as such in linguistic terms. But they are not innovations in the religious sense, and these are not the things that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was warning us against.\xa0\nAnd there is no such thing in Islam as Bid`ah hasanah (good innovation).”\xa0(Majmu` Fatawa Ibn `Uthaymin, vol. 2, p. 291)\xa0\nCategories of Bid`ah\xa0\nBid`ah may be divided into two categories:\xa0\n\nBid`ah which constitutes disbelief\xa0\xa0\nBid`ah which does not constitute disbelief\xa0\n\nBid`ah which constitutes disbelief\xa0\n\xa0If you ask, what is the definition of Bid`ah which constitutes disbelief and that which does not constitute disbelief?\xa0\nThe answer is:\xa0\nShaykh Hafith Al-Hakami (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“The kind of Bid`ah which constitutes disbelief is when one denies a matter on which there is scholarly consensus, which is widely-known, and which no Muslim can have any excuse for not knowing, such as denying something that is obligatory, making something obligatory that is not obligatory, or making something prohibited permissible, or making something permissible prohibited; or believing some notion about Allah, His Messenger and His Book when they are far above that, whether in terms of denial of affirmation\xa0 – because that means disbelieving in the Quran and in the message with which Allah sent His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).\xa0\nExamples include the Bid`ah of the Jahmiyyah, who denied the attributes of Allah; or the notion that the Quran was created; or the notion that some of the attributes of Allah were created; or the Bid`ah of the Qadariyyah\xa0 who denied the knowledge and actions of Allah; or the Bid`ah of the Mujassimah who likened Allah to His creation… etc.\xa0\nBid`ah which does not constitute disbelief\xa0\nThe second category, Bid`ah which does not constitute disbelief, is defined as that which does not imply rejection of the Quran or of anything with which Allah sent His messengers.\xa0\nExamples include the Marwani Bid`ahs (which were denounced by the greatest Companions (who did not approve of them, although they did not denounce them as disbelievers or refuse to give them Bay`ah because of that), such as delaying some of the prayers until the end of the due times, doing the ‘Eid Khutbah before the ‘Eid prayer, delivering the Khutbah whilst sitting down on Fridays, etc.” (Ma`arij Al-Qubul, 2/503-504)\xa0\nCan you call one who commits Bid`ah\xa0 a disbeliever?\xa0\nThe answer is that it depends.\xa0\nIf the Bid`ah constitutes disbelief, then the person is one of the following two types:\xa0\n\nEither it is known that his intention is to destroy the foundations of Islam and make the Muslims doubt it. Such a person is definitely a disbeliever; indeed, he is a stranger to Islam and is one of the enemies of the faith.\nOr he is deceived and confused; he cannot be denounced as a disbeliever until proof is established against him, fair and square.\xa0\n\nIf the Bid`ah does not constitute disbelief, then he should not be denounced as a disbeliever. Rather, he remains a Muslim, but he has done a gravely evil action.\xa0\nHow should we deal with those who commit Bid`ah?\xa0\nThe answer is:\xa0\nShaykh Muhammad ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“In both cases, we have to call these people – who claim to be Muslim but who commit acts of Bid`ah which may constitute disbelief or may be less than that – to the truth, by explaining the truth without being hostile or condemning what they are doing. But once we know that they are too arrogant to accept the truth – for Allah says (interpretation of the meaning), `And insult not those whom they (disbelievers) worship besides Allah, lest they insult Allah wrongfully without knowledge.’ [Al-An`am 6:108] – if we find out that they are stubborn and arrogant, then we should point out their falsehood, because then pointing out their falsehood becomes an obligation upon us.\xa0\nWith regard to boycotting them, that depends upon the Bid`ah. If it is a Bid`ah which constitutes disbelief, then it is obligatory to boycott the person who does it. If it is of a lesser degree than that, then it is essential to examine the situation further. If something may be achieved by boycotting the person, then we do it; if no purpose will be served by it, or if it will only make him more disobedient and arrogant, then we should avoid doing that, because whatever serves no purpose, it is better not to do it. And also in principle it is impermissible to boycott a believer, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: `It is not permissible for a man to forsake [not speak to] his brother for more than three [days].’”\xa0(Adapted from Majmu` Fatawa Ibn `Uthaymin, vol. 2, p. 293)\xa0\n\nShirk, its types and the definition of each\xa0\n\nTypes of Shirk\nShaykh Muhammad ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Shirk is of two types, major Shirk which puts a person beyond the pale of Islam, and minor Shirk .”\xa0\n\nThe first type, major Shirk , is “Every type of Shirk which the Lawgiver described as such and which puts a person beyond the pale of his religion” – such as devoting any kind of act of worship which should be for Allah to someone other than Allah, such as praying to anyone other than Allah, fasting for anyone other than Allah or offering a sacrifice to anyone other than Allah. It is also a form of major Shirk to offer supplication (Du`a) to anyone other than Allah, such as calling upon the occupant of a grave or calling upon one who is absent to help one in some way in which no one is able to help except Allah.\xa0\nThe second type is minor Shirk , which means every kind of speech or action that Islam describes as Shirk, but it does not put a person beyond the pale of Islam – such as swearing an oath by something other than Allah, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said that whoever swears an oath by something other than Allah is guilty of disbelief or Shirk .\n\nThe one who swears an oath by something other than Allah but does not believe that anyone other than Allah has the same greatness as Allah, is a Mushrik who is guilty of lesser Shirk, regardless of whether the one by whom he swore is venerated by people or not. It is not permissible to swear by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), or by the president, or by the Ka`bah, or by Jibril, because this is Shirk, but it is minor Shirk which does not put a person beyond the pale of Islam.\xa0\nAnother type of minor Shirk is showing off, which means that a person does something so that people will see it, not for the sake of Allah.\xa0\nImpact of showing off on acts of worship\nThe ways in which showing off may cancel out acts of worship are either of the following:\xa0\n\nThe first is when it is applied to an act of worship from the outset, i.e., the person is not doing that action for any reason other than showing off. In this case, the action is invalid and is rejected, because of the Hadith of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) which was attributed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), which says that Allah said, “I am so Self-sufficient that I am in no need of having an associate. Thus he who does an action for someone else’s sake as well as Mine will have that action renounced by Me to him whom he associated with Me.” (Narrated by Muslim, Kitaab Az-Zuhd, 2985)\xa0\nThe second is when the showing off happens later on during the act of worship, i.e., the action is originally for Allah, then showing off creeps into it. This may be one of two cases:\xa0\n\nThe first is when the person resists it – this does not harm him.\nFor example, a man has prayed a Rak`ah, then some people come along during his second Rak`ah and it occurs to him to make the Ruku` or Sujud longer, or makes himself weep, and so on. If he resists that, it does not harm him, because he is striving against this idea. But if he goes along with that, then every action which stemmed from showing off is invalid, such as if he made his standing or prostration long, or he made himself weep – all of those actions will be cancelled out. But does this invalidation extend to the entire act of worship or not?\xa0\nWe say that either of the following must apply:\xa0\n\nEither the end of his act of worship was connected to the beginning (with no pause); so if the end of it is invalidated then all of it is invalidated.\n\nThis is the case with the prayer – the last part of it cannot be invalidated without the first part also being invalidated, so the whole prayer is invalid.\n\nOr if the beginning of the action is separate from the end of it, then the first part is valid but the latter part is not. Whatever came before the showing off is valid, and what came after it is not valid.\xa0\n\nAn example of that is a man who has a hundred Riyals, and gives fifty of them in charity for the sake of Allah with a sound intention, then he gives fifty in charity for the purpose of showing off. The first fifty are accepted, and the second fifty are not accepted, because the latter is separate from the former.” (Majmu` Fatawa wa Rasa’il Ibn `Uthaymin, and Al-Qawl Al-Mufid Sharh Kitab Al-Tawhid, vol. 1, p. 114, 1st\xa0edition)\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10843/categories-of-bidah-and-shirk
