515785,"I heard that if the debtor does not return the money before the debt period ends, the lender will receive the reward of charity for each day of delay. If the time to pay comes and the borrower does not give the money back, so the lender gives him extra time, the reward will be doubled. But is it best for me to waive the debt, meaning that he will never pay it, or to accept the virtue of the doubled reward after the debt period ends? Does this also apply if I do not give the debtor a specific period to pay off the debt, and will I get the reward of charity for each day, or until it is doubled?","['Praise be to Allah.The religious texts enjoin allowing extra time for a debtor who is in difficulty, and encourage doing that. They state that the lender will have the reward of giving the amount of the debt in charity every day, until the time for repayment comes. And if he allows him extra time after payment becomes due, then he will have a double reward for charity.\nSee the answer to question no. 192301 .\nSecondly:\nWhat is mentioned above does not mean that allowing extra time for payment of the debt is better than waiving it. Rather waiving the debt in full or in part is better than allowing extra time.\nThat is because waiving the debt is in fact allowing extra time and more.\nThis is what is indicated by the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{If the debtor is in difficulty, give him time until it is easy for him to repay. But if you remit it by way of charity, that is better for you, if only you knew}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:280].\nAl-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIn these words, Allah, may He be exalted, recommends giving charity to the one who is in difficulty, and He describes that as being better than allowing him more time to pay off the debt. This was stated by as-Suddi, Ibn Zayd and ad-Dahhak. End quote.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said in his commentary on Surat al-Baqarah:\nWhat we learn from the verse is the virtue of waiving a debt, and that it is an act of charity, because Allah, may He be exalted, says: {But if you remit it by way of charity, that is better for you}.\nWaiving it is Sunnah, and giving the debtor more time is obligatory; in this instance, what is Sunnah is better than what is obligatory according to the text of the Qur’an, because Allah, may He be exalted, says: {But if you remit it by way of charity, that is better for you}. That is because what is obligatory is included in what is Sunnah, because waiving the debt for one who is in difficulty is giving him extra time and more. Based on that, the one who was confused about this issue thought that what is obligatory is better than what is Sunnah. We may say to him that his view is wrong, because this Sunnah is included in what is obligatory, so it is obligatory and more. Allah spoke the truth when He said in the hadith qudsi: “My slave does not draw close to me by anything more beloved to Me than what I have made obligatory for him.” End quote.\nAnd Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his commentary on the verse quoted above:\nHere Allah, may He be exalted, enjoins [the lender] to be patient with the one who is in difficulty and cannot afford to pay off his debt. Hence He says: {If the debtor is in difficulty, give him time until it is easy for him to repay}.\nThen Allah encourages the lender to waive the debt, and promises much good and great reward in return for that, as He says: {If the debtor is in difficulty, give him time until it is easy for him to repay. But if you remit it by way of charity, that is better for you, if only you knew}. In other words: if you give up your capital altogether and waive the debt for the debtor. There are hadiths narrated via several chains of narration from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) which speak of that. End quote.\nBased on that, the best is to waive the debt in full or in part from the debtor.\nThirdly:\nWith regard to the debt for which no time has been set for payment, the basic principle is that it is due at any time, meaning that the lender may ask for it to be paid immediately.\nImam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Every loan is due at any time. End quote. What is meant is that this is the basic principle, so long as there is no agreement on a deadline for payment. See: ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘ (9/101).\nWhat appears to be the case – and Allah knows best – is that for every day that goes by, the lender will have the reward of giving the amount of his debt in charity, and this is like the debt for which payment has now become due.\nAlso applicable to this debt is the idea that waiving the debt from the debtor in whole or in part is better than giving him more time to pay it off, and there is goodness in both options.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/515785/is-giving-a-debtor-more-time-to-pay-better-than-waiving-the-debt
21581,"Some people who recite Ruqyah for those who are possessed or who suffer epilepsy, recite Quran over water and blow into it, then they tell the sick person to wash with this water. What is the ruling on doing that?","['Praise be to Allah.Blowing into water is of two types:\xa0\n\nIf reciting the Quran and blowing into water is done with the intention of seeking Barakah (blessing) from the saliva of the one who blows into it, this is undoubtedly prohibited, because the saliva of any person is not a means of blessing and healing, and there is no one from whose relics blessing may be sought except Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Blessing cannot be sought from the relics of anyone else.\xa0\n\nBlessings were sought from the relics of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) during his life and after his death, if those relics remained.\xa0\nUmm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) had a small bell-shaped vessel of silver in which she kept some hairs of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), from which the sick sought healing.\xa0\nIf a sick person came to her, she would pour some water over these hairs and stir it, then give it to the sick person.\xa0\nBut apart from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), it is not permissible to seek blessing from the saliva of anyone, or from his sweat or his garment, etc. Rather this is prohibited and is a kind of polytheism. If the blowing into the water is done for the sake of seeking blessings from the saliva of the one who blows on it, then it is prohibited and is a kind of polytheism.\xa0\nThat is because everyone who attributes an effect to something with no evidence from Shari`ah or proof in reality, has committed a kind of shirk, because he is making his blowing as a cause of healing alongside Allah, and proving that something is a cause of something else is to be based on Shar`i evidence. Everyone who follows a means that Allah has not made to be a cause, either according to reality or Shari`ah, has committed a kind of polytheism.\xa0\n\nIf a person blows with saliva after reciting Quran, such as Al-Fatihah – which is a kind of Ruqyah and is the greatest kind of Ruqyah that may be recited over a sick person – so he recites Al-Fatihah then blows into the water – there is nothing wrong with this.\xa0\n\nSome of the Salaf did this, and it is effective and beneficial by Allah’s leave. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to blow into his hands when going to sleep, after reciting Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad , and Qul A`udhu bi Rabbil-Falaq and Qul A`udhu bi Rabbin-Nas , then he would wipe his hands over his face and whatever he could of his body.\nAnd Allah knows best..']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21581/reciting-quran-then-blowing-into-water
318312,"A while ago, I swore an oath regarding my children that neither I nor their father would buy them any electronic devices again. When I was visiting my family, my husband called me and told me that he had bought electronic devices for the children, because he forgot that I had sworn an oath that we would not buy such things. Do I have to offer expiation for the breaking of my oath (kaffarat yamin)?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nSwearing that someone else should not do a certain thing is a binding oath, the consequences of which are to be borne by the one who swore the oath.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf he said: “By Allah, So-and-so should surely do – or not do – such and such”; or he swore an oath regarding someone who was present, and said: “By Allah, you should surely do such and such,” then he broke the oath and did not do that thing, then expiation must be offered by the one who swore the oath. This was stated by Ibn ‘Umar, the people of Madinah, ‘Ata’, Qatadah, al-Awza‘i, the people of Iraq and ash-Shafa‘i. That is because it is as if the one who swore the oath broke it, so he is required to offer expiation, as if he is the one who did what he swore not to do, and because the reason for offering expiation is either the oath or the breaking of the oath or both. Whichever happened, it has to do with the one who swore the oath. End quote from al-Mughni (13/502).\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhat is meant by swearing an oath regarding someone else is when the oath-maker swears that someone else should surely do such and such. If that person breaks the oath and does not fulfil it, then expiation is to be offered by the one who swore the oath, not the one concerning whom the oath was sworn, according to the majority of jurists. For example, if someone swears an oath regarding his slave or his child or his friend, saying that they must surely do something, then the other person does not do it, expiation must be offered by the one who swore the oath that has been broken. End quote from Majmu‘ al-Fatawa (1/206).\nSecondly:\nIf the person concerning whom the oath was sworn does not fulfil the oath because he forgot, then nothing is required of the one who swore the oath, because if the one who swore the oath did that thing himself because he forgot, then nothing is required of him. That is because the one who forgets is excused and there is no sin on him, and expiation is prescribed to absolve the sin of breaking the oath.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{There is no sin on you if you make a mistake in that regard, but [you are accountable] for what your hearts deliberately intend}\xa0[al-Ahzaab 33:5].\nIt was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas said: Allah, may He be exalted, revealed the words: { Allah does not place on any soul a burden greater than it can bear. For it is what it has earned, and against it is what it has committed. Our Lord, do not hold us accountable if we forget or fall into error} [al-Baqarah 2:286]. Allah said: I have granted that. Narrated by Muslim (126).\nIt says in ar-Rawd al-Murbi‘ (3/1554).\nIf he swears an oath regarding himself or someone else over whom he has authority and who would fulfil his oath, intending to prevent that person, such as his wife or child, from doing something, then that person does it out of forgetfulness or ignorance, the oath is broken and the divorce or manumission of a slave come into effect… That is, in contrast to an oath sworn explicitly by Allah, may He be exalted, and the like, because this is the right of Allah, and He has already forgiven this ummah for what it does by mistake or out of forgetfulness. End quote.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf he does the thing concerning which the oath was sworn out of forgetfulness or ignorance, then the scholars said that in the case of an oath that one’s wife would be divorced or one slave would be manumitted if someone else did the thing mentioned in the oath, then the oath is broken and the divorce and manumission will come into effect. But they said regarding an oath sworn explicitly by Allah that the oath is not broken [if the other person does the thing concerning which the oath was sworn to prevent him doing that thing]. But the correct view is that there is no difference and the oath is not broken in either case, just as it is not broken in the case of an oath sworn explicitly by Allah. This applies if the person who swore the oath swore it regarding himself.\nBut if he swore an oath regarding someone else, to prevent him from doing something, either swearing explicitly\xa0 by Allah, saying that his wife would be divorced or his slave would be manumitted [if he did that thing], or making a vow, then one of two scenarios must apply to the other person.\nThe first scenario is that the person concerning whom the oath was sworn is someone who would usually comply with his oath and refrain from the matter in question. In other words, if the person swears an oath concerning him, he will comply with his oath, because of ties of kinship, marriage or friendship.\nThe second scenario is that this other person is someone who would not comply with his oath, and would not care about it, as we will discuss below.\nIf this other person is someone who would usually comply with his oath and fulfil it, and would not go against it, because of ties of kinship, marriage or friendship, such as if he swears an oath regarding his wife, that she should not do something, then she does it out of forgetfulness or ignorance; or he swears an oath regarding his child, son or daughter, that the child should not do something, then the child does it out of forgetfulness or ignorance, this other person comes under the same ruling as the one who swore the oath, as if he is him. So if he does it out of forgetfulness or ignorance in the case of an oath that was sworn explicitly by Allah, the oath is not broken, but if it has to do with manumission or divorce, then the oath is broken [and the divorce or manumission comes into effect].\nFor example:\nA man says to his son: “If you do such and such, your mother is divorced,” then the child does that thing out of forgetfulness; is the mother divorced? Yes, she is divorced according to the madhhab.\nIf he says to his son: “If you do such and such, then my slave is free,” then the child does that thing out of forgetfulness, the oath is broken and the slave is manumitted, just as if he swore the oath regarding himself.\nBut the correct view is that the oath is not broken, just as if he swore the south explicitly by Allah, may He be glorified and exalted.""(Ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘\xa0 15/2 02).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/318312/she-swore-an-oath-regarding-her-husband-and-he-did-not-fulfil-her-oath-because-he-forgot
175051,,"['Praise be to Allah.Is saying `Rabb Ighfir Li’ mandatory?\nThe scholars differed concerning the ruling on the Takbirs of movement in the prayer and on saying between the two prostrations, “Rabb Ighfir Li (Lord forgive me).” There are two opinions:\n\nThe first opinion, which is the view of the majority of Hanafis, Malikis and Shafi`is, is that the Takbirs of movement and saying “Rabb ighfir li (Lord forgive me)” between the two prostrations come under the heading of the Sunnahs of prayer and are not obligatory parts of the prayer.\nThe second opinion is that they are obligatory parts of the prayer. This is the view of the Hanbalis.\n\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Mughni (1/298): The well-known view narrated from Ahmad is that the Takbir said when going down and coming up, the Tasbihs of bowing and prostration, saying “Sami`a Allahu liman hamidah, Rabbana wa laka Al-hamd (Allah hears those who praise Him, our Lord to You be praise)”, saying “Rabb ighfir li (Lord forgive me)”, saying “Rabb ighfir li (Lord forgive me)” between the two prostrations, and the first Tashahhud, are all obligatory. It is also the view of Is-haq and Dawud.\nAnd it was narrated from Ahmad that it is not obligatory, which is the view of most of the jurists, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not teach it to the one who prayed improperly, and it is not permissible to delay explaining something at the time when it becomes necessary.\xa0\nMoreover, Ibn Qudamah quoted a number of things to indicate that it is obligatory:\n\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) enjoined it, and his instruction indicates that something is obligatory.\nHe did it and he said: “Pray as you have seen me praying.”\nAbu Dawud (856) narrated from `Ali ibn Yahya ibn Khallad from his paternal uncle that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The prayer of one of the people is not complete unless he does wudu’ … Then he says: Allahu Akbar, then bows.” Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud.\nBecause the points at which these Adhkars are recited are pillars or essential parts of the prayer, dhikr at these points is obligatory, just as there are words to be recited when standing.\n\nWith regard to the Hadith about the one who prayed improperly, it is mentioned in the Hadith that we narrated that he (the Prophet, blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) taught him that. It is something additional that must be accepted.\xa0 The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not teach you all the obligatory parts of the prayer, based on the fact that he did not teach the Tashahhud or the Salam. So it is to be understood as meaning that he limited it to teaching him only that which he had seen him doing improperly.”\nIt says in Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah (4/40):\nWhen sitting between the two prostrations, it is Sunnah to pray for forgiveness, according to the Hanafis, Malikis and Shafa`is, and it is one opinion that was narrated from Ahmad. The basis that is to be found in the report narrated by Hudhayfah, according to which he prayed with the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and he used to say between the two prostrations: “Rabb ighfir li, Rabb ighfir li (Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me).”\nHowever, asking for forgiveness here is not obligatory, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not teach it to the one who prayed improperly. The well-known view of the Hanbalis is that it is obligatory. This is also the opinion of Is-haq and Dawud, and saying it one time is sufficient.”\xa0\nThis is a matter concerning which there is a difference of opinion among the scholars. The most that can be said is that the view of the Hanbalis, that the Takbirs of movement are obligatory, is more likely to be correct, because of the evidence mentioned above, and because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The imam has been appointed to be followed, so when he says Takbir, then say Takbir…” (Narrated by Muslim, no. 411)\nWith regard to the Du`a between the two prostrations, the opinion of the majority, which is that it is recommended, is more likely to be correct, because there is no evidence to clearly indicate that it is obligatory.\nWhat to say between Sujud\nIt is better for the worshipper to recite Du`as that have been narrated in the texts between the two prostrations. With regard to adding to the Du`as that have been narrated, or saying a Du`a that was not narrated , what appears to be the case is that it is permissible.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/175051/is-saying-rabb-ighfir-li-mandatory
