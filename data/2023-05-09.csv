217461,"I saw in one of your answers that joking is permissible if it is true. Can you explain that by giving some examples? Is it permissible to joke by saying mocking words, such as when through his tone of voice, a person indicates that what he means is something other than what he is saying? Is it permissible to tell jokes that are based on imaginary situations?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt is well known and established among all Muslims that lying is haram in all cases; in fact, the reprehensible nature of telling lies and the prohibition thereon is something on which all religions agree, and the aversion to lying is something that is deeply rooted in sound human nature, no matter what religion a person follows.\nWhat is required of the Muslim is to be truthful in his speech in all situations.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{O you who have believed, fear Allah and be with those who are true}\xa0[at-Tawbah 9:119].\nIt was narrated from ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud (may Allah be pleased with him) from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), who said: “Truthfulness leads to righteousness, and righteousness leads to Paradise. A man may continue to speak the truth until he is recorded with Allah as a speaker of truth. Lying leads to wickedness and wickedness leads to Hell. A man may continue to tell lies until he is recorded with Allah as a liar.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (6094) and Muslim (2607).\nIt was narrated from ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There are four characteristics, whoever has them all is a pure hypocrite, and whoever has one of them has one of the characteristics of hypocrisy, until he gives it up: when he is entrusted with something, he betrays that trust; when he speaks, he lies; when he makes a covenant, he breaks it; and when he disputes, he resorts to foul speech.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (34) and Muslim (58).\nSecondly:\nThe prohibition on telling lies when joking is proven in the Sunnah:\nIt was narrated that Bahz ibn Hakim said: My father told me that his father said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “Woe to the one who speaks and tells lies in order to make the people laugh; woe to him, woe to him.” Narrated by Abu Dawood (4990); classed as hasan by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud (4990).\nIt is also encouraged to refrain from lying when joking:\nIt was narrated that Abu Umamah said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “I guarantee a palace on the outskirts of Paradise for one who refrains from arguing even if he is in the right, and a house in the middle of Paradise for one who refrains from lying even when he is joking, and a house in the highest part of Paradise for one who makes his attitude good.” Narrated by Abu Dawud (4800); classed as hasan by al-Albani in Silsilat al-Ahadith as-Sahihah, no. 273.\nIt was narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud said: It is not right to lie in earnest or in jest, or for any one of you to promise something to his child then not fulfil that promise. Narrated by al-Bukhari in al-Adab al-Mufrad (387).\nThirdly:\nJoking, whether it is based on truth or lies, has many scenarios:\n1. When the joke is based on truth, and there is no lying involved\nThe basic principle regarding this kind of joking is that it is permissible, if it is done from time to time and the individual is not joking most of the time, and it does not lead to obvious mischief.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe scholars said: The kind of joking that is not allowed is when one goes to extremes in joking and persists in that, for it provokes laughter, leads to hardheartedness, and distracts people from remembering Allah, may He be exalted, and focusing their religious duties. In many cases, it also leads to causing offence and development of grudges, and it undermines dignity and respect. As for joking that is free of such elements, that is what is permissible, and that is what the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to do. He (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) only used to do that on rare occasions, when it served a purpose, or to comfort the one addressed and put him at ease. There is nothing wrong with that at all; rather it is Sunnah and is encouraged, if it is of this type.""(Al-Adhkar\xa0 p. 377).\n2. When the joke is based on a lie\nThis type of joking is prohibited, as seen in the hadith of Bahz ibn Hakim quoted above.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about someone who tells people stories that he has made up, and all of them are lies: is that permissible?\nHe replied: As for the one who tells made-up stories to make people laugh, or for some other purpose, he is disobeying Allah and His Messenger. Bahz ibn Hakim narrated from his father, from his grandfather, from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), who said: “The one who speaks and tells lies in order to make the people laugh, woe to him, woe to him, then woe to him.” And Ibn Mas‘ud said: It is not right to lie in earnest or in jest, or for any one of you to promise something to his child then not fulfil that promise.\nIf, however, that involves transgression against the Muslim, or it involves saying something that goes against Islamic teachings, then it is more emphatically prohibited. Whatever the case, the one who does that is deserving of shar‘i punishment [at the discretion of the qadi] that will deter him from doing it. And Allah knows best.""(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa\xa0 32/255-256).\nIn Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah (26/52), it says:\nQuestion: If, for example, we tell a lie as a joke, if that haram or not?\nAnswer: Yes, it is haram. In fact, it is a major sin, even if it is a joke.\nAnd Allah is the source of strength. May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.\nPermanent Committee for Academic Research and Ifta’\n‘Abdullah ibn Qa‘ud, ‘Abdullah ibn Ghadyan, ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ‘Afifi, ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baz.\nEnd quote.\n3. Joking by telling stories, when you are not certain whether they are true, but they could have happened \xa0\nWhat appears to be the case, based on the actions of some scholars, is that this type of joking is permissible. In the books of some of the scholars we find some funny stories that are attributed to people who lived centuries before, even though it is difficult to verify the stories. But there is no deliberate intention to tell a lie or to transmit a lie, even if the teller does not make an effort to verify the story and ensure that what he is transmitting is true.\nShaykh ‘Abd al-Muhsin az-Zamil said:\nInteresting and funny stories are of three types:\n\nStories which we know to be true. There is nothing wrong with this type, on condition that the story does not contain any haram elements, mocking of others or backbiting. It must be free of these things. If the story is permissible, there are no reservations about it, and if it is something that really happened or is most likely to have happened, there is nothing wrong with that.\nStories which are known to be lies and did not happen. It is not permissible to tell these stories.\nStories regarding which it is not known whether they happened or not. There is nothing wrong with telling these stories.\n\nHence the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Narrate from the Children of Israel, with no reservations.” Among the stories that are narrated from them are strange and amazing stories that may have happened, so he told the Muslims to narrate from them, and stated that in some of the stories that are narrated from them there are things that are even more amazing.\nAbu Dawud narrated with a jayyid (good) isnad that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to narrate stories from the Children of Israel after ‘Isha’ prayer, and he would not be interrupted for anything except for the obligatory prayer.\nThis highlights the fact that he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would sometimes address them for a long time after ‘Isha’ prayer.\nAs noted above, there is nothing wrong with telling these stories regarding which it is not known whether they happened or not, if they are not known to be lies, as Ibn Kathir and a number of other scholars pointed out. End quote.\n4. Imaginary stories which the listeners know are imaginary and did not really happen\nIf these entertaining stories are made up and told to serve a purpose, such as using them as a means to teach and educate, and the like, then a number of scholars have issued fatwas stating that they are permissible.\nShaykh Muhammad Rashid Rida (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWith regard to these imaginary stories, which are akin to the maqamat stories [which are written in rhymed prose] written by our earlier scholars, which were read in religious schools and other schools, such as the Maqamat of al-Badi‘ and the Maqamat of al-Hariri... he – i.e., al-Hariri – said that he did not know any of the scholars of the ummah in his time who forbade such stories which are made up about animals, such as the book of Kalilah wa Dimnah and the like, because the purpose behind them was beneficial exhortations, and the details of the story are not the main purpose. We have never heard of any scholar after him who forbade reading his Maqamat.""(Fatawa al-Imam Muhammad Rashid Rida\xa0 3/1091-1092).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf someone wants to present an example when telling a story, such as if he says: I am going to tell you of the example of a man who said such and such, or did such and such, and such and such happened, and the outcome was such and such, there is nothing wrong with this, to the extent that one of the scholars said regarding the verse {And present to them an example of two men: We granted to one of them two gardens of grapevines, and We bordered them with palm trees and placed between them [fields of] crops} [al-Kahf 18:32]: This did not really happen, and in the Qur’an it says: {Allah presents an example: a slave owned by quarreling partners and another belonging exclusively to one man - are they equal in comparison? Praise be to Allah! But most of them do not know} [az-Zumar 39:29]. So if someone tells a story and does not attribute it to a specific person, but it is as if something happened, and the outcome was such and such, there is nothing wrong with that.\nBut if he attributes it to someone and it is false, then this is haram and is a lie. The same applies if the purpose of telling the story is to make people laugh, because it is narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that he said: “Woe to the one who speaks and lies in order to make the people laugh; woe to him, then woe to him.”""(Liqa’ al-Bab al-Maftuh\xa077/23).\nShaykh Ibn Jibrin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\nIt is common among some of our brothers to tell interesting stories which involve lies in order to make people laugh, and when we advise them [not to do that], they say: It is permissible to tell interesting stories if it could have happened, even if you do not know whether it actually happened. Is that correct?\nHe replied:\nThe word translated here as “interesting stories” is used to refer to strange stories, and usually they are things that happened, but they could be imaginary. The purpose of that is to present an example, as al-Hariri did in his Maqamat, and as others did who wrote books containing these interesting stories.\nBut it is prohibited to tell lies for the purpose of making people laugh. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Woe to the one who speaks and tells lies in order to make the people laugh; woe to him, woe to him.”\nBut if the audience knows that this is an imaginary tale and did not really happen, but it could have happened, so it is a warning against a similar thing that could happen, or it is preparing people for such possible events, then this is permissible. And Allah knows best. End quote.\nWhat may be understood from the fatwas of Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin and Shaykh Ibn Jibrin (may Allah have mercy on them both) is that this permissibility is restricted to the kind of imaginary story that is told for a purpose or as a lesson, and is not about a particular person. If the story is made up about a particular person, or is made up just to make people laugh, then that is not permissible.\nAmong the earlier scholars who held a similar view was Ibn Hajar al-Haytami ash-Shafa‘i (may Allah have mercy on him), who said:\nThe sahih hadith “Narrate from the Children of Israel, with no reservations” and the report which says “Wonders occurred among them” indicate that it is permissible to listen to such wondrous stories for entertainment and not for any other purpose. End quote.\nFrom this it may be understood that it is permissible to listen to strange and wondrous stories, or any stories regarding which we cannot be certain that they are lies, for the purpose of entertainment, and even if it is certain that it is a lie, but the purpose is to give an example, exhort and educate, such as encouragement to be brave in the imaginary words of humans or animals.""(Tuhfat al-Muhtaj bi Sharh al-Minhaj\xa0 9/398).\n5. What we understand from what is mentioned in the question – Is it permissible to joke by saying mocking words, such as when through his tone of voice, a person indicates that what he means is something other than what he is saying? \xa0– is that this is referring to when a man says to his friend: Do you have such and such? And the friend answers: No, but from his joking tone of voice, the questioner will understand that what he means is yes.\nIn this case, if we only focus on the words, then it is a lie, because no is the opposite of yes.\nBut if we look at what the listener understands from the context, it may not be a lie, because the meaning that the listener understood was correct, and because words may have different meanings depending on the context in which they are said and the way in which they are uttered. So, for example, the phrase “What is this?” is a question, but a person may sometimes say it in a particular tone of voice from which what is understood is amazement or objection, and the like.\nSimilar to that is what was narrated from ash-Sha‘bi (may Allah have mercy on him), that a dull-witted man met ash-Sha‘bi and a woman who was walking with him, and he said: Which of you is ash-Sha‘bi? He said: She is. The scholars mentioned this story; it was mentioned by adh-Dhahabi in Siyar A‘lam an-Nubala’ (4/311), without comment.\nThe ruling on this type of story is not clear, and we have not come across any scholarly views concerning it. What is most likely to be the case is that there is a concession allowing this type, especially when there is another strong and clear indication to indicate what is meant, although it would have been better not to narrate the story, so as to avoid a dubious matter. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “That which is halal is clear and that which is haram is clear, and between them are doubtful matters of which many people are not aware. Whoever guards against the doubtful matters will protect his religious commitment from shortcomings and will protect his honour from slander, but whoever falls into that which is doubtful will fall into that which is haram, like a shepherd who grazes his flock around private land; he will soon graze in it…” Narrated by al-Bukhari (52).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/217461/examples-of-permissible-kinds-of-joking-and-the-ruling-on-telling-made-up-jokes
279129,"I previously asked you, in question no. 278157, about getting a job on the basis of a degree which was obtained with some cheating, and the ruling on the salary that is based on having that degree, and you referred me to question number 26123 , which quoted a fatwa from Shaykh ‘Abd al-Karim al-Khudayr. I have read many answers on this website, and I found that some of the scholars say that there is nothing wrong with working on the basis of this degree, if the person has repented from cheating and is good at his job. We would like you to give the evidence and the basis for this view (which is that the degree or certificate does not become invalid because of cheating).","['Praise be to Allah.Cheating and deceiving are haram, whether in exams or otherwise, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever deceives [or cheats] does not belong to me.” Narrated by Muslim (102).\nThe one who has committed any such action must repent to Allah, may He be exalted.\nBut there is nothing wrong with his working on the basis of that degree, if he is good at his job, because the primary and greatest aim of stipulating that job applicants should have a degree in order to do certain jobs is to ascertain that the person is qualified to do this particular job, even on the basis of probability.\nMoreover, every boss or company which requires or stipulates that employees should have a degree is aware that some of those who have that degree may not be qualified for the job, and the way in which they obtained the degree may have involved some kind of transgression and the like, and this is something that is fairly common and well-known. But usually they initially require a degree as an indication that the person is qualified to do this job, then they watch to see how he actually performs.\nIf the person does his job in the manner that is required of him and others like him, then the purpose of stipulating that he should have a degree is fulfilled.\nIt is a waste of time and effort to seek to find out exactly how he obtained this certificate, and whether there was any transgression, cheating and the like involved. It is quite clear that this requires too much effort and it will be too difficult to establish exactly how he obtained this certificate.\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: A man got a job on the basis of a degree certificate, but he cheated in the exams for this degree. Now he is performing well, according to the testimony of his bosses. What is the ruling on his salary – is it halal or haram?\nHe replied: There is nothing wrong with it, in sha Allah, but he must repent to Allah for what he did of cheating. That is provided that he is doing his work as it should be done. In that case, there is no problem with regard to his salary, but he erred by cheating in the past, and he must repent to Allah from that.""(Majmu‘ Fatawa Ibn Baz\xa0 19/31).\nThe way to work out the ruling in such cases is to note what is mostly the case, and overlook what rarely happens. Hence we must differentiate between one who cheated in the exams and one who obtained a fake certificate.\nIf the workplace requires a particular degree, and the person obtained it by cheating in the exams, then the condition has been met and the sin that he committed may be overlooked, unlike the one who did not sit the exams and obtained a fake certificate, because that certificate carries no weight.\nSee the answer to question no. 93019 .\nIf, in addition to the fact that he is doing his work in the manner required, or he is doing it like his peers, he has also repented from transgressing and cheating, the concession of letting him off becomes stronger, because it is known that one of the objectives of sharia is helping the penitent in his repentance and forgiving what has happened in the past. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Those who consume interest cannot stand [on the Day of Resurrection] except as one stands who is being beaten by Satan into insanity. That is because they say, “Trade is [just] like interest.” But Allah has permitted trade and has forbidden interest. So whoever has received an admonition from his Lord and desists may have what is past, and his affair rests with Allah. But whoever returns to [dealing in interest or usury] - those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide eternally therein}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:275].\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThis is general in meaning and applies to everyone who has received an admonition from his Lord: Allah has ordained that he may have what is past.\nThe fact that this is proven in the case of a Muslim is supported by what it says in a subsequent verse: {O you who have believed, fear Allah and give up what remains [due to you] of interest} [al-Baqarah 2:278]. Allah enjoined them to give up what remains, but He did not enjoin them to return what they had already received. This, along with the phrase {may have what is past, and his affair rests with Allah} [in v. 275] indicates that they may keep what they had received in the past. And Allah accepts repentance from His slaves.\nIf someone were to say: This verse refers exclusively to the disbelievers,\nthe response is: There is nothing in the verse to indicate that; rather Allah says: {So whoever has received an admonition from his Lord and desists may have what is past}. Rather it is more appropriate that this should include the Muslim as well as the disbeliever.\nIn fact, it may be said that this applies to anyone who is aware that something is haram, then an admonition comes to him from his Lord, so he gives it up. Allah will forgive the one who repents on the basis of his repentance, so whatever he did in the past becomes as if it did not happen, and the verse refers to him too: {[he] may have what is past, and his affair rests with Allah}.\nThis is also indicated by the subsequent verses:\n{O you who have believed, fear Allah and give up what remains [due to you] of interest, if you should be believers.\n... But if you repent, you may have your principal}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:278-279].\nRepentance refers to both the Muslim who has sinned as well as the disbeliever [i.e., both of them may repent].(Jami‘ al-Masa’il\xa0 1/271 ff).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/279129/ruling-on-a-job-acquired-with-a-degree-for-which-there-was-some-cheating-in-the-exams
