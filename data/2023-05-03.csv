258447,"My brother bought a used car, and he kept it for more than two years, driving it and travelling in it, and nothing happened to it during this time. More than two months ago, my brother sold this car “as is”, after a mechanic brought by the purchaser had checked it, and after it had passed the roadworthiness test that is compulsory before selling a car here in Morocco. Now the purchaser of the car has got in touch with my brother and told him that the car has a defective, namely that the roof has been replaced, which means that it was probably involved in an accident. My brother is now confused: is there any sin on him? Is this sale regarded as valid according to Islamic teachings? Does my brother have to compensate the purchaser for this defect? Please note that he sold his car because he needed the money.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIf someone buys a car then discovers a defective in it, and it is the type of defective that could detract from its value, then he has the choice between returning it or keeping it and receiving compensation from the seller for this defective. The scholars call this compensation an indemnity.\nIt says in Kashshaf al-Qina‘ (3/218): If someone buys a defective product and was not aware of it at the time of the purchase, then he has the choice, regardless of whether the seller was aware of the defective and concealed it from the purchaser, or he was not aware of the defective. …\nThe purchaser has the choice between returning it, so as to make up for what he has lost and to alleviate any harm that may affect him if he keeps it, as a result of the reduction in the value of the item…\nOr, if he returns it, he should receive the price in full, because by cancelling the deal, the purchaser is entitled to take back the price in full. …\nOr he may keep the item, and receive compensation for the defective, even if it is possible to return it, whether the seller likes it or not, because the two parties agreed to the deal on the basis that the payment was in return for the item, and each part of the item could be valued in monetary terms, but when there is a defective, it is as if part of the item is missing, so he has the right to receive money instead, and this is the indemnity (compensation). End quote.\nThus it is known that the option to return the defective item is established, regardless of whether the seller was aware of the defective or not, and regardless of whether the purchaser examined the item or not. Once the defective is discovered, he has the option [of cancelling the deal].\nIf your brother was not aware of the defective, then there is no sin on him, but the purchaser has the choice between returning the car or keeping it and receiving compensation.\nThe compensation is the difference between the value of the defective car and its value if it was in sound condition; this amount is to be deducted from the price.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said, explaining that:\nThe word indemnity (or compensation) refers to the difference between the value of the item in sound condition and the value of the defective item.\nHe said value, and he did not say price, because there is a difference between the value and the price, which is: the value is the market price of the item, and the price is what is agreed to in the transaction.\nSo if you buy something for six that is worth eight, then its value is eight and its price is six …\nHence he said: The difference between the value of the item in sound condition and the defective item is that the item is to be evaluated when it is in sound condition, then it should be evaluated when it is defective, and the difference between the two should be worked out. That is the indemnity (compensation) that should be deducted from the price.\nThe evaluation should be done at the time of making the deal, not at the time when the defective is discovered, because the value may vary between the time when the deal is made and the time when the defective is discovered.""(Ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘\xa0 8/318).\nSo your brother has to go back to the one from whom he bought the car in the first place, and ask him for compensation for the defective.\nSecondly:\nWhat is mentioned above, that the purchaser is the one who is to make the decision, and that he has the right to keep the car and ask for compensation, is the view of the majority of scholars.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) was of the view that there is no option of receiving compensation; rather the purchaser may either return the item or keep it without compensation, and there can be no compensation except with the consent of the seller.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The words “or he may return it and take back the price” mean: you have the right to return the item, cancel the deal and take back the price. So the purchaser has the option [of cancelling the deal]. This is the view of the jurists (may Allah have mercy on them).\nBut Shaykh al-Islam said: Either he may keep it without compensation, or he may return it. As for compensation, the consent of the seller is essential, because it is a transaction.\nSo the seller may say: I sold this thing to you; either keep it or return it. As for compensation, this is regarded as a new transaction.\nThe shaykh’s view has merit, but if we know that the seller is a cheat – meaning that he was aware of the defective but concealed it – then in this case the choice is between keeping the item and receiving compensation, or returning it.\nThis ruling is applicable in the case of concealing defects and in the case of charging too much for the item.""(Ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘\xa0\xa08/319).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/258447/he-bought-a-car-after-checking-it-then-he-found-a-defective-of-which-the-seller-was-not-aware-does-he-have-the-option-to-cancel-the-deal
219157,"I would like to know how the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) cleaned himself with water (istinja’) after relieving himself, especially after urinating. Are there any reports in the Sunnah about that? Did he pour water on himself, or did he take water in his hand and wipe? What is the correct way? And how much water should be used to do as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did? And how did he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) purify his hand afterwards?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade extravagance in all things, and he was economical in his use of water when purifying himself; he would not use too much of it, to the extent that he would do wudu’ with a mudd of water, as Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said. Narrated by Muslim (325).\nA mudd is the amount of water that can be held in the two cupped hands of a man of average build.\nSimilarly, he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was not extravagant in his use of water when he cleaned himself after relieving himself (istinja’); he did not use any more than necessary, which is the amount needed to remove the impurities from the place.\nPlease see the answer\xa0to question\xa0no. 171285 \xa0.\nSecondly:\nIt was the practice of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), if he needed to clean himself after relieving himself, or to remove any dirt, to do that directly with his left hand.\nAbu Dawud (33) narrated that ‘A’ishah said: The right hand of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was for his wudu’ and food, and his left hand was for cleaning himself after relieving himself and removing any dirt.\nClassed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud.\nAl-Bukhari (265) and Muslim (317) narrated that Ibn ‘Abbas said: Maymunah said: I brought water to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to do ghusl with it. He poured water on his hands and washed each one two or three times, then he scooped water with his right hand onto his left hand and he washed his private parts. Then he rubbed his hand on the ground – according to one report: then he rubbed his hand on the ground, or on the wall. –\xa0\nSo if he was able to scoop water from the vessel with his right hand and wash with his left hand, he did that.\nAl-Bukhari (150) and Muslim (271) narrated that Anas ibn Malik said: When the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) went out to relieve himself, another boy and myself would bring a vessel of water, meaning for him to clean himself with it.\nThe word translated here as vessel refers to a small leather vessel that is used to carry water, as is stated in Fath al-Bari by Ibn Hajar (1/76).\nIbn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf the water was in a small leather vessel and the like, he would pour the water from it onto his private part.""(Fath al-Bari by Ibn Rajab\xa0 1/276).\nThirdly:\nWhen the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came out of the place where he went to relieve himself, he would rub his hand on the ground, as noted above in the hadith of Maymunah, then he would “wash his private parts. Then he rubbed his hand on the ground.”\nAn-Nasa’i (50) narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did wudu’, and when he cleaned himself after relieving himself, he rubbed his hand on the ground. Classed as hasan by al-Albani in Sahih an-Nasa’i.\nThis action is clear and the meaning is understandable; it was in order to remove anything that may have got stuck on the hand as a result of cleaning oneself, such as dirt or an unpleasant odour. Hence Imam al-Bukhari included it in a chapter entitled: Wiping the hand with dust to clean it. End quote.\nIt says in ‘Awn al-Ma‘bud (1/44):\nIn order to remove an unpleasant odour, if it remains after washing the hand. End quote.\nIf the individual washes his hands with soap and the like, which will remove such traces, this is similar to rubbing it on the ground, or maybe better.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIt is recommended for the one who has cleaned himself with water, after he has finished, to clean his hand with dust or potash, or to rub it with dust or on the wall, to remove any off-putting traces from it. End quote from Sharh Muslim (3/231).\nThen he would do wudu’ as for prayer; he would start by washing his hands three times, before putting them into the vessel.\nAl-Bukhari (265) and Muslim (317) narrated that Ibn ‘Abbas said: My maternal aunt Maymoonah told me: I brought the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) water to do ghusl from janabah. He washed his hands two or three times, then he put his hand in the vessel and poured some water over his private part and washed it with his left hand. Then he struck his left hand on the ground and rubbed it vigorously. Then he did wudu’ as for prayer, then he poured three handfuls of water over his head, then he washed the rest of his body. Then he moved away from the spot where he had been standing and washed his feet.\nAccording to a report narrated by Muslim: He washed his hands two or three times, then he put his hand in the vessel.\nSee also the answers to questions no. 2532 and 127362 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/219157/how-the-prophet-blessings-and-peace-of-allah-be-upon-him-cleaned-himself-with-water-istinja-after-relieving-himself
