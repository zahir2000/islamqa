193008,"I embraced Islam when I was seventeen, and for a long time I had no sources to learn from except the Internet. So I used to pray in an incorrect manner, and I carried on like that for more than a year. In the beginning, I used to pray in the Shi‘i way, then I was guided to the path of Ahl al-Sunnah. I also used to do wudu’ in an imperfect manner, and I did not know Arabic, so I used to recite al-Fatihah and other adhkar incorrectly. In other words, for more than a year, my prayer contained many errors. My question is: do I have to make up those prayers?","['Praise be to Allah.If someone is new in Islam and is not able to do what Allah has enjoined upon him of purification, prayer or fasting in the prescribed manner that absolves him of accountability because he is unaware of the rulings, and does not have sufficient, sound means of acquiring sound knowledge, so he thinks that what he is doing is what is prescribed, then when it becomes clear to him that he is wrong, he follows the truth and adheres to Allah’s rulings and what He has prescribed, then he should not be instructed to repeat what he did imperfectly of the duties enjoined by Allah. He is excused for his ignorance, because he only did things the way he did them before because he was ignorant and made mistakes, and he is to be excused for that, because of the general meaning of the verses (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And never would We punish until We sent a messenger}\xa0[al-Isra’ 17:15]\n{And never would your Lord have destroyed the cities until He had sent to their mother a messenger reciting to them Our verses}\xa0[al-Qasas 28:59]\n{Our Lord, do not impose blame upon us if we have forgotten or erred}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:286].\nIbn Majah (2034) narrated that Abu Dharr al-Ghifari (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has forgiven my ummah for what they do by mistake or out of forgetfulness, and what they are forced to do.” Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah.\nAl-Hafiz said in al-Fath (5/161):\nThis is a great hadith. Some of these scholars said: It should be counted as half of Islam, because deeds are either done intentionally and by choice, or they are not. The latter either happens by mistake, or out of forgetfulness, or because one is forced to do it, and this category is forgiven, according to scholarly consensus. Rather the scholars only differed as to whether what is overlooked is the sin or the ruling or both? The apparent meaning of the hadith points to the last of these, and whatever is exempted from that, such as murder, has its own evidence. End quote.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf someone prays without deliberation, and does not know that that is obligatory, there is a difference of scholarly opinion regarding him: does he have to repeat it after the time for the prayer has ended or not? There are two well-known views, both of which are views in the madhhab of Ahmad and others.\nThe correct view is that in such a case, the person is not required to repeat the prayer, because it is soundly narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that he said to the Bedouin who prayed badly: “Go and pray, for you have not prayed,” two or three times, then the man said: By the One Who sent you with the truth, I cannot do any better than this, so teach me what will suffice me in my prayer. So the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) taught him to pray with deliberation. (Agreed upon). And he did not instruct him to repeat whatever he had prayed before that time, even though he said, By the One Who sent you with the truth, I cannot do any better than this. Rather he instructed him to repeat that prayer, because the time for it had not yet ended, so he was instructed to offer that prayer on time. But in the case of prayers for which the time had ended, he did not instruct him to repeat them, even though he had omitted some of their obligatory parts, because he had not been aware that that was required of him. Similarly, he did not instruct ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) to make up the prayers that he did not offer because of being in a state of janabah, because he was not aware that he could have prayed after doing tayammum. And in the case of the woman who was suffering from istihadah [prolonged non-menstrual bleeding], she said to him: I suffer from extremely heavy bleeding that prevents me from fasting and praying, he instructed her to do wudu’ for each prayer, but he did not instruct her to make up the prayers that she had not offered. By the same token, in the case of those who ate during Ramadan until one of them could distinguish a white thread from a black thread, so they ate after dawn had broken, he did not instruct them to repeat their fasts. These people were unaware of what was obligatory, but he did not instruct them to make up what they had failed to do when they were ignorant of the rulings. Moreover, a disbeliever is not instructed to make up what he did not do when he was in a state of disbelief and ignorance, in contrast to one who was aware of what is obligatory, but failed to do what is required because he forgot; such a person is to be instructed to do it when he remembers it.""(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa\xa0 21/429-431).\nAl-Suyuti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf someone is unaware of the prohibition of something of which most people are aware, the claim of ignorance cannot be accepted from him, unless he is a recent convert to Islam, or he grew up in a remote wilderness where people may not be aware of these prohibitions, such as the prohibition on zina, murder, stealing and alcohol, and on speaking during the prayer or eating when fasting.""(Al-Ashbah wa’n-Naza’ir\xa0p. 200).\nBased on that, you do not have to repeat those prayers that you offered before. Praise be to Allah, Who has guided you to the light of Islam. We ask Allah to enable us and you to adhere firmly to the path of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jama‘ah.\nYou should contact Islamic centres which are active in educating people and teaching them about their religion, to learn the true religion and how to adhere to the path of the righteous early generations.\nYou should also read Islamic websites that follow the path of Ahl al-Sunnah.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/193008/does-she-have-to-repeat-the-prayers-that-she-offered-in-a-wrong-manner-because-she-was-new-in-islam
225160,What are the guidelines on how to give advice in Islam? Should it be done privately or in front of other people? Who is qualified to do that?,"['Praise be to Allah.Virtues of giving advice in Islam\nGiving sincere advice is one of the prominent characteristics of Islamic brotherhood; it is part of perfect faith and Ihsan, for a Muslim’s faith cannot be perfect until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself, and until he hates for his brother what he hates for himself. This forms the motive for giving sincere advice.\nAl-Bukhari (57) and Muslim (56) narrated that Jarir ibn `Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I gave my oath of allegiance to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), pledging to establish regular prayer, pay Zakah and be sincere towards every Muslim.\nMuslim (55) narrated from Tamim Ad-Dari (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Religion is sincerity.” We said: To whom? He said: “To Allah, to His Book, to His Messenger, and to the leaders of the Muslims and their common folk.”\nIbn Al-Athir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Sincerity towards the common folk of the Muslims means: guiding them to that which is in their best interests.” (An-Nihayah, 5/142)\nEtiquette of giving advice in Islam\nThere is a general etiquette for giving sincere advice to which the one who is compassionate towards the Muslims should adhere. This includes the following:\n\nHis motive for giving advice should be love of good for his brother and hating for anything bad to befall him.\xa0\n\nIbn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“With regard to giving sincere advice to the Muslims, [the one who wishes to do that] should love for them what he loves for himself, hate for them what he hates for himself, feel compassion for them, show mercy to their young ones, show respect to their elders, and share their grief and their joy, even if that is detrimental to his worldly interests, such as loving for prices to be dropped for them, even if that causes him to lose some profits on what he sells of trade goods. By the same token, he should hate everything that could cause them harm. He should love what is good for them, and hope for harmony to exist among them and for them to continue enjoying the blessings of Allah. He should pray that they always prevail against their enemies and that all harm be warded off from them. Abu `Amr ibn As-Salah said: Nasihah (sincerity, sincere advice) is a comprehensive word which means that the one who is sincere should want all kinds of good for the one to whom advice is offered, and should try to achieve that for him. (Jami` Al-`Uloom wa’l-Hikam, p. 80)\n\nHe should be sincere when giving advice , seeking thereby to please Allah. He should not intend thereby to prove his superiority over his brother.\n\n\nThat advice should be free of any element of deceit or betrayal.\xa0\n\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Sincerity means being truthful and honest, with no element of deceit or betrayal. The Muslim, because of his great loyalty and love towards his brother, is sincere towards him and advises him to do all that will benefit him and that he thinks is pure, with no element of insincerity or deceit. Hence the Arabs say Dhahab Nasih [from the same root as Nasihah], meaning pure gold that is free of any element of cheating. And they say `Asal Nasih (pure honey), meaning honey that is free of beeswax or any element of cheating.” (Majmu` Fatawa Ibn Baz, 5/90)\n\nHe should not intend when giving advice to shame his brother or put him down.\n\nIbn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) wrote an essay on this topic entitled Al-Farq Bayna An-Nasihah wat-Ta`yir (The difference between sincere advice and shaming).\n\nThe advice should be given in a spirit of brotherhood and friendship, with no element of rebuke or harshness. Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n“Invite to the way of your Lord with wisdom and good instruction, and argue with them in a way that is best.”\xa0[An-Nahl 16:125]\n\nIt should be done on the basis of knowledge and clear proof.\xa0\n\nAs-Sa`di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Wisdom dictates that giving advice to others should be done on the basis of knowledge, not ignorance, and that one should start with that which is more important, then that which is less important, and with that which is easy to explain and understand, and that which is more likely to be accepted. The advice should be given in a kind and gentle manner. If the person to whom the advice is given pays heed to this approach, which is based on wisdom, all well and good; otherwise we should move on to exhorting him with good instruction, which means enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong, accompanied by mention of the reward from Allah for doing good and the punishment for doing wrong. If the person to whom that is addressed believes that what he is doing is sound and correct, or he calls people to falsehood, then we should argue (debate) with him in a way that is best, which means debating with him in ways that are based on rational arguments and religious texts, which includes quoting evidence that he regards as sound and valid, for that is more likely to lead to a positive response. The debate should not lead to dispute or trading of insults, for that would defeat the purpose and serve no interest; rather the aim of the debate is to guide people to the truth, not merely to prove the other side wrong, and so on. (Tafsir As-Sa`di (p. 452)\n\nThe advice should be given privately, not out loud in front of people, unless doing so serves a clear interest that outweighs any negative consequences.\xa0\n\nIbn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“When the early generations wanted to advise someone, they would exhort him in private, to the extent that one of them said: Whoever exhorts his brother one-to-one, that is sincere advice (Nasihah), whoever exhorts him in front of people is shaming him. Al-Fudayl said: The believer conceals his brother’s faults and gives him advice in private, whereas the evildoer exposes his faults and shames him.” (Jami` Al-`Ulum wal Hikam, 1/236)\nIbn Hazm (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“If you give advice, then give advice in private, not in public, and by hinting, not by speaking bluntly, unless the person to whom advice is given will not understand hints, in which case there is no option but to speak bluntly.… If you go beyond these guidelines, then you are wronging him and are not being sincere in your advice.” (Al-Akhlaq was Siyar, p. 45)\nHowever, if there is a scenario where giving advice openly clearly serves the greater interest, then there is nothing wrong with giving advice openly, such as correcting one who made a mistake in matters of belief (`Aqidah) in front of people, lest people be deceived by what he said and follow him in his mistake. Another example is denouncing someone who tells people that Riba (usury) is permissible, or spreads Bid`ah (innovation) and immorality among people. In such cases giving advice in public is prescribed, and may even be obligatory, because of the greater interest that is served thereby, and so as to ward off harm that is likely to occur.\nIbn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“If the aim is no more than highlighting the truth of the matter, so that people will not be deceived by the wrong notions uttered by that person, then undoubtedly he (the one who seeks to give advice) will be rewarded for his intention, and on the basis of his intention he will be regarded as being sincere towards Allah, His Messenger, the leaders of the Muslims and their common folk.” (Al-Farq Bayna An-Nasihah wat Ta`yir, p. 7)\n\nThe one who seeks to give sincere advice should choose the best words and phrases, deal gently with the person who he is advising, and speak kindly to him.\nThe one who seeks to give advice should bear with patience any harm that may result because of his advice.\nHe should respect confidentiality and conceal the faults of his fellow Muslim, and not speak ill of him to others. The giver of sincere advice is gentle and compassionate, loves good and seeks to conceal people’s faults.\nHe should verify the facts before offering advice, and not act on the basis of assumption or conjecture, so that he will not be accusing his brother of something that he did not do.\nHe should choose the appropriate time to give advice. Ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: People’s energy fluctuates; sometimes they are focused and receptive, and sometimes they lack energy and are not receptive. So approach people when they are energetic and receptive, and let them be when they are lacking energy and focus. (Narrated by Ibn Al-Mubarak in Az-Zuhd, 1331)\nHe should practice what he preaches, doing what he enjoins people to do and refraining from that which he forbids them to do. Allah, may He be Exalted, said, rebuking the Children of Israel for the contradiction between their words and deeds (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n“Do you order righteousness of the people and forget yourselves while you recite the Scripture? Then will you not reason?”\xa0[Al-Baqarah 2:44]\nThere is a stern warning to the one who tells people to do what is right when he does not do it himself, and forbids them to do what is wrong when he does it himself.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/225160/etiquette-of-giving-advice-in-islam
218843,Can we say “Ma sha Allah” if we see a talent or a good deed on the part of a person who is not Muslim?,"['Praise be to Allah.Causing harm to someone by means of the evil eye or envy (hasad) is a kind of transgression against the afflicted person. It is not permissible to transgress against anyone whose life and property are protected by Islamic law, and it is prescribed to offer supplication asking that the evil eye be warded off from him.\nIbn Majah (3509) narrated that one of the Sahabah saw another man bathing and admired his skin, thus afflicting him with his eye. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Why would any one of you kill his brother? If he sees something that he likes in his brother, then let him pray for blessing for him.” Classed as sahih by Shaykh al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) in Sahih Sunan Ibn Majah. For more information on what the Muslim should say if he sees something that he likes or admires, please see the answer to question no. 130786 .\nMention of the brother in the hadith, where the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) says, “If he sees something that he likes in his brother” does not mean that the disbeliever whose life and wealth are protected by Islamic law is not included in this ruling. If a disbeliever is not in a state of war with the Muslims, his blood, life and wealth are protected, so it is not permissible to transgress against him. Al-San‘ani (may Allah have mercy on him) said – regarding the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), “Reviling a Muslim is evildoing” – if the person is a mu‘ahad [a non-Muslim living under Muslim rule], then that is harming him, and it is forbidden to harm him… But if he is a harbi [a non-Muslim whose people are at war with the Muslims], it is permissible to revile him, because he has no protection.""(Subul al-Salaam\xa02/663).\nBased on that, the disbeliever whose people are at war with the Muslims has no protection, but for the disbeliever whose people are not at war with the Muslims, it is not permissible to transgress against him.\nMoreover, it is permissible for a Muslim to do ruqyah for a disbeliever if he has been harmed or is unwell, so it is more appropriate that it be permissible to ward off harm for him before it happens, by praying for blessing for whatever one likes or admires in the disbeliever.\nFor more information on the issue of it being permissible for a Muslim to do ruqyah for a disbeliever, please see the answer to question no. 6714 .\nBut here we must note an important matter, which is that envy (hasad) is a blameworthy characteristic according to the religion of Allah, even if it is envy of a disbeliever. The first one who is harmed by envy is the envier himself, and envy is not something that Islam teaches to its followers or encourages them to behave in such a manner, even with disbelievers.\nIt was narrated that ‘A‘ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: Some Jewish people came to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and said: Al-sam ‘alayka (death be upon you), O Abu’l-Qasim.\nHe said: “Wa ‘alaykum (and also upon you).”\n‘A‘ishah said: I said: Rather may death and shame be upon you.\nThe Messenger of Allah (S) said: “O ‘A‘ishah, do not be harsh.”\nAccording to one report, he said: “Enough, O ‘A‘ishah, for Allah does not like harshness and harsh words.”\nShe said: Did you not hear what they said?\nHe said: “Did I not respond to what they said? I said: Wa ‘alaykum (and also upon you).”\nNarrated by al-Bukhari (6038) and Muslim (2165).\nThe relevant part of the hadith is that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not want ‘A‘ishah\xa0 to be harsh and speak harsh words, even if that was in retaliation to those Jews. Undoubtedly envy is like harsh words in that regard; in fact it is worse, as is obvious. However, the fact that the Muslim is not allowed to envy someone else or afflict him with his evil eye is one thing, and his praying for blessing for him and offering supplication for him is something else.\nWhat appears to us to be the case – and Allah knows best – is that even if the Muslim is not allowed to envy disbelievers or harm them with his evil eye, it is not required of him to pray for blessing for him and offer supplication for him.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/218843/is-it-permissible-to-pray-for-blessing-if-you-see-something-you-like-in-a-disbeliever
222367,What is Tahlil marriage?,"['Praise be to Allah.What is Tahlil marriage?\nThe husband is given the option of taking back his wife if he has divorced her (by Talaq) twice, and this is called revocable divorce . Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“The divorce is twice, after that, either you retain her on reasonable terms or release her with kindness.” [Al-Baqarah 2:229]\nIf he divorces her a third time, then she becomes prohibited for him and it is not permissible for him to marry her with a new marriage contract and mahr unless she marries someone other than him, in a valid and genuine marriage, then he (second husband) consummates the marriage with her, then divorces her or dies and leaves her a widow. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And if he has divorced her (the third time), then she is not lawful unto him thereafter until she has married another husband. Then, if the other husband divorces her, it is no sin on both of them that they reunite, provided they feel that they can keep the limits ordained by Allah. These are the limits of Allah, which He makes plain for the people who have knowledge.” [Al-Baqarah 2:230]\nIt was narrated from `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that Rifa`ah Al-Qurathi (may Allah be pleased with him) married a woman then he divorced her, issuing a third divorce. Then she married another man, then she came to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and told him that he did not have intercourse with her, and the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) understood that she wanted to go back to Rifa`ah, so he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “No, not until he (the second husband) tastes your sweetness and you taste his sweetness [A metaphor for consummation of the marriage].” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 5011 and Muslim, 1433)\nForms of Tahlil marriage\nIt is not permissible for the man who issued the divorce, or for the woman, to use tricks to get around the laws of Allah and get back together by means of what is called a Tahlil marriage.\xa0\nThis kind of marriage takes several forms, including the following:\n\nWhere the husband who had issued the divorce, or the woman, or her guardian, hire a human “billy-goat”, and stipulate that he must marry the divorced woman, consummate the marriage with her, then divorce her, and they give him a sum of money in return for that!\nWhere a man marries that divorced woman without making any agreement with anybody, but his aim is to make her permissible for the first husband, then he divorces her.\n\nTahlil marriages are prohibited and invalid , and those who do that deserve to be cursed.\n`Abdullah ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) cursed the Muhallil and the Muhallal lahu. [The Muhallil is the one who marries a woman and divorces her so that she can go back to her first husband, and the Muhallal lahu is the first husband.] (Narrated and classed as authentic by At-Tirmidhi, 1120; also narrated by An-Nasa’i, 3416)\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“It was classed as authentic by Ibn Qattan and Ibn Daqiq Al-`Eid according to the conditions of Al-Bukhari.” (At-Talkhis Al-Habir, 3/72)\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“With regard to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) cursing them [the Muhallil and the Muhallal lahu], this is either telling that Allah, may He be Exalted, has cursed them, or it is a supplication for them to be cursed. This indicates that it is prohibited and is a major sin.” (Zad Al-Ma`ad fi Hadiy Khayr Al-`Ibad, 5/672)\n`Uqbah ibn `Amir (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Shall I not tell you of a borrowed billy-goat?” They said, Yes, O Messenger of Allah. He said, “He is Al-Muhallil. May Allah curse Al-Muhallil and Al-Muhallal lahu.” (Narrated by Ibn Majah, 1936; classed as sound by Al-Albani in Saheeh Ibn Majah)\nIs Tahlil marriage valid?\nThese Hadiths indicate that Tahlil marriage is prohibited, and that it is a major sin; they also indicate that it is not valid.\nIt says in Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah (10/256, 257):\n“The majority of scholars – the Malikis, Shafi`is, Hanbalis and Abu Yusuf among the Hanafis – are of the view that Tahlil marriage is invalid, because of the two Hadiths quoted above, and because marriage for the purpose of Tahlil comes under the same heading as temporary marriage, and stipulating that a marriage is to be temporary renders it invalid. So long as the marriage is invalid, no Tahlil occurs thereby [i.e., it does not make it permissible for the woman to go back to her first husband after the second marriage ends] This is supported by the view of `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: “By Allah, no Muhallil or Muhallal lahu will be brought to me but I will stone them.”\xa0\nShaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“This is one of the most abhorrent kinds of falsehood, and one of the gravest kinds of corruption. He is in effect a Zani (fornicator or adulterer), because he did not marry her so that she could be a wife to him, and keep him chaste and stay with him, and so that he might hope to have children from her. No, rather he came as a borrowed billy-goat, to make her permissible for the one who came before him, by having intercourse with her once, then leaving her and finishing with her. This is the Muhallil; his marriage is invalid and is not legitimate, and she does not become permissible for the first husband so long as (the second husband ) married her with this intention and for this purpose. It is an invalid marriage and she is not permissible for him or for the first husband, because this is not a marriage, and Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “until she has married another husband” [Al-Baqarah 2:230] This is a borrowed billy-goat, not a legitimate husband, and he does not make her permissible for the first husband.” (Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 20/277, 278)\nDoes mentioning the condition of Tahlil in the marriage contract make it valid?\nWith regard to the prohibition on Tahlil marriage and its invalidity , it makes no difference whether the condition of Tahlil is specifically mentioned in the marriage contract or if the agreement is made beforehand and not mentioned at the time of the marriage contract, or the second husband had that intention without anybody stipulating it or coming to some agreement to that effect with him. In all these cases, it is a Tahlil marriage and is prohibited.\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“There is no difference of opinion, according to the people of Madinah, the scholars of Hadith and the jurists, whether that is stipulated verbally or by implicit agreement and intention, because in their view the intention behind contracts carries weight, and actions are judged by intentions, and in their view a condition was agreed implicitly is like one that was spoken aloud, because words are not sought in and of themselves, but because of the meaning to which they point. So once the meaning and intention become clear, the actual words do not matter, because they are just the means (of expressing what is in the heart) and in this case that aim has been achieved, therefore the rulings are to be based on the aims.” (Zad Al-Ma`ad fi Hadiy Khayr Al-`Ibad, 5/110)\nThe scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas said:\n“If a man marries a woman on condition that it be for the purpose of Tahlil, or he intends that , or they both agree to that, then the marriage contract is invalid and the marriage is not legitimate.” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 18/439)\nAl-Bayhaqi (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated in As-Sunan Al-Kubra (7/208) from Nafi` (may Allah have mercy on him) that he said: A man came to `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) and asked him about a man who divorced his wife three times , then a brother of his married her without any prior agreement with him, so as to make her permissible for his brother – does she become permissible for the first husband? He said: No, unless it is a genuine marriage. We used to regard this as fornication at the time of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nShaykh Muhammad ibn Salih Al-`Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“If the second husband has the intention that when he has made her permissible for the first husband he will divorce her, then she does not become permissible for the first husband, and the marriage is invalid. The evidence for that is that this is the intention of Tahlil, so it is included in the curse. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Actions are but by intentions, and each person will have but that which he intended.” (Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti` `Ala Zad Al-Mustaqni`, 12/176, 177)\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) listed all the forms in one place, and regarded them all as forms of Tahlil marriage which is prohibited and invalid.\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Tahlil marriage is prohibited and invalid, and it does not make it permissible (for the woman to go back to her first husband). What it means is that if a man divorces his wife three times , then she becomes prohibited for him until she has married another husband, as Allah, may He be Exalted, states in His Book, and as is stated in the Sunnah of His Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and the Ummah unanimously agreed on that. If another man marries her with the intention of divorcing her so that she will become permissible for her first husband, this marriage is prohibited and invalid, whether he decides after that to keep her or to leave her, and whether that is stipulated in the marriage contract, or was stipulated before the marriage contract, or was not stipulated verbally… Or none of that happened; rather the man decided to marry her, then divorce her so that she would become permissible for the one who had divorced her three times, without the woman or her guardian being aware of any of that, whether the husband who had divorced her three times was aware of it or not, such as if the Muhallil thought that this was a good deed and a favour to the man who had divorced her and his wife, by helping her to go back to him because he thought that the divorce had caused harm to them and their children and their families, and so on.\nIn fact, it is not permissible for the one who divorced his wife three times to marry her again until she has been married by a man who wanted a genuine marriage, not a sham marriage, and he consummated the marriage with her in the sense that she tasted his sweetness and he tasted her sweetness, then after that if they happened to be separated by death or divorce or annulment of the marriage, then it is permissible for the first one to marry her.… This is what is indicated by the Quran and Sunnah, and it is what was narrated from the companions of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and from all of those who followed them in truth, and the majority of the Muslim jurists. … This is the view of Malik ibn Anas and all his companions, and of Al-Awza`i, Al-Layth ibn Sa`d, and Sufyan ath-Thawri; it is also the view of Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal among the scholars of Hadith, including Ishaq ibn Rahawayh, Abu `Ubayd Al-Qasim ibn Salam, Sulayman ibn Dawud Al-Hashimi, Abu Khaythamah Zuhayr ibn Harb, Abu Bakr ibn Abi Shaybah, Abu Ishaq Al-Jawzajani and others. It is also the view of Ash-Shafi`i.” (Iqamat Ad-Dalil `Ala Ibtal At-Tahlil, p. 6-8). The author quoted many views from leading religious scholars stating that Tahlil marriage is prohibited.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/222367/what-is-tahlil-marriage
