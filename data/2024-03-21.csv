499515,What is the ruling on a fasting person using a patch to remove the feeling of hunger and thirst? And does the ruling differ between someone who is unable to fast without it and someone who can?,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe patch for removing the sensation of hunger and thirst is a medical patch known as (diet patches) that is placed on the skin and consists of several chemical substances that work to remove the sensation of appetite and reduce the amount of water lost by the body, and is mostly used for the purpose of weight loss in dieting.\nSpecialists have mentioned that the basic and active substances of the typical medical patch consist of several substances, each with a role to play, and together these substances enable the patch to remove the sensation of hunger and thirst and reduce appetite (see: Al-Muftirat At-Tibbiyyah Al-Mu`asirah, p. 333-334).\nSecondly:\nThe majority of Jurists have opined that what enters the body through absorption by the skin pores does not break the fast of the person fasting, and they cited the Hadith of \'Aishah and Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with them): ""The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) would be overtaken by dawn in a state of janabah (major ritual impurity) from his family, then he would perform ghusl and fast,"" reported by Al-Bukhari (1825) and Muslim (1109). The point of evidence is that water penetrates the pores, and if it broke the fast, the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) would not have done it while fasting, and would have done it before dawn.\nThey also cited the report from Ibn Mas`ud in which he said: ""When it is a fasting day for one of you, let him wake up oiled and combed,"" reported by Al-Bukhari in a suspended form, Book of Fasting, Chapter on the ghusl of the fasting person.\nAnd they also cited the report of Abu Hurairah in which he said: ""When one of you is fasting, let him apply oil so that the effects of his fasting are not visible on him,"" reported by Ibn Abi Shaybah, (9755).\nAl-Zaila`i (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his discussion of what does not invalidate the fast: ""Or if he applied oil... he did not break the fast,"" ""Tabyin Al-Haqa\'iq Sharh Kanz Al-Daqa\'iq"" (1/322).\nThe members of the Fiqh Council unanimously agreed that ointments, creams, and medical patches do not break the fast. (See: Statement of the Islamic Fiqh Council, Journal of the Islamic Fiqh Council, Issue 10, Vol. 2, p. 454.)\nModern medicine has also established that there is no relationship between what enters through the pores of the head or otherwise and the digestive system, and what a person finds in terms of taste in his throat is from the taste buds and not due to the substance reaching the throat. (Journal of the Islamic Fiqh Council, previous reference, Vol. 2, p.262).\nThirdly:\nThe patch for removing the sensation of hunger and thirst does not break the fast, for the following reasons:\n1. What enters through the pores does not affect the validity of the fast as previously determined, and this is the reality of this patch.\n2. It is neither eating nor drinking, nor does it serve their purpose by nourishing the body.\n3. Intending not to feel hunger and thirst does not affect the validity of the fast, as it is proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) would cool himself with water while fasting to remove the sensation of fatigue. It is established in Abu Dawud: ""The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) would pour water over his head while fasting due to thirst or heat,"" reported by Abu Dawud (2365) and authenticated by Al-Albani.\nIt is also proven that the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) used to do that, as Al-Bukhari reported ""that Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) would wet a garment and place it on himself while fasting,"" reported by Al-Bukhari in a suspended form, Book of Fasting, Chapter on the ghusl of the fasting person.\nAnd Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) said: ""I had a small pool that I would plunge into while I was fasting."" Reported by Al-Bukhari in a suspended form, Book of Fasting, Chapter on the ghusl of the fasting person.\nIf the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) and the noble Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) intended to alleviate the burden of fasting, then the patch that removes the sensation of hunger and thirst is similar to this situation.\n4. The argument for prohibition due to its contradiction to wisdom is not accepted, as the objectives are derived purposes, and the rulings are not linked to them, but rather to the causes which are apparent and regulated characteristics. (See: Al-Muftirat At-Tibbiyyah Al-Mu`asirah, p. 333-338).\n5. In the decision of the Fiqh Council (No. 219) in its twenty-third session in Medina, during the period from 19-23 Safar 1440 AH, concluding the decision of the Council of the International Islamic Fiqh Academy No. 93(10/1) regarding nullifiers of the fast in the field of treatment.\nWhat does not invalidate the fast:\n4- The patch for removing the sensation of hunger.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/499515/ruling-on-appetite-suppressant-patches-while-fasting
93747,"If I enter the mosque late for `Isha’ prayer and I missed the `Isha’ prayer in congregation and I pray it on my own, and I am late in joining the Tarawih prayers because of doing `Isha’, and I miss two Rak`ahs of Tarawih, how should I do these two Rak`ahs? Alone or what?","['Praise be to Allah.Can you pray `Isha’ behind someone praying Tarawih?\nIf you miss `Isha’ and arrive when the Imam is praying Tarawih, it is better for you to join him with the intention of praying `Isha’ . When he says the Salam, you should complete your prayer and not pray alone or with another congregation, so that there will not be two congregations at the same time, which may lead to distraction due to the intermingling of voices.\xa0\nWhat to Do If You Miss Part of Tarawih?\nAs for what you have missed of Tarawih , if you wish you may do it, so you may pray two Rak`ahs when the Imam prays Witr, then pray what you missed, and then pray Witr. \xa0\nWhat is meant by praying two Rak`ahs when the Imam prays Witr is that you do not say Salam with him when he ends his Witr, rather you should stand up and pray another Rak`ah, then say the Salam.\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: If I join the people when they are praying Tarawih and I have missed part of it, should I make up what I have missed after Witr or what should I do?\xa0\nHe replied:\xa0\n“Do not make up what you have missed after Witr , rather if you want to make up what you have missed, then pray two Rak`ahs when the Imam prays Witr, then offer the prayers you missed, then pray Witr.\xa0\nHere there is an issue to which attention should be drawn: If you arrive when the Imam is praying Tarawih and you have not prayed `Isha’ yet, what should you do?\xa0 Should you pray `Isha’ on your own or join the Imam in Tarawih with the intention of praying `Isha’?\xa0\nThe answer is that you should join the Imam in Tarawih with the intention of praying `Isha’. When the Imam says Salam from Tarawih, then stand up and make up the rest of `Isha’. Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) mentioned the exact same issue, and this was also the view favoured by Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him), and this is the correct view, because the correct view is that it is permissible to offer an obligatory prayer in congregation behind an Imam who is offering an optional prayer , based on the evidence of the Hadith of Mu`adh ibn Jabal (may Allah be pleased with him) who said that he used to pray `Isha’ with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), then he would go back to his people and lead them in offering that prayer – it was optional for him and obligatory for them.” (Al-Liqa’ Ash-Shahri)\xa0\nIt is better for you to make it up in congregation if you can, but if that is not possible then there is nothing wrong with you making it up on your own.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/93747/what-to-do-if-you-miss-part-of-tarawih
293605,"If one does not perform the Tarawih prayer in the mosque for one or more days, does it fall under the saying of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him): ""Whoever stands (in prayer) during Ramadan with faith and seeking reward, his previous sins will be forgiven,"" or is it necessary to stand (in prayer) all the nights of Ramadan?","['Praise be to Allah.Abu Hurairah narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: ""Whoever stands (in prayer) during Ramadan with faith and seeking reward, his previous sins will be forgiven."" Reported by Al-Bukhari (2009) and Muslim (759).\nThe apparent meaning of the Hadith is that it refers to standing (in prayer) for the entire month of Ramadan, whether it is done in congregation in the mosque or at home. Thus, the ruling includes everyone who stands (in prayer) during Ramadan, whether in congregation or alone, in the mosque or at home.\nAs-San`ani said:\n""It is possible that it means standing (in prayer) for all its nights, and that whoever stands for part of it does not achieve the forgiveness mentioned, which is the apparent meaning."" End quote from ""Subul As-Salam"" (4/182).\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n""He (the Prophet) said: \'Whoever stands (in prayer) during Ramadan\' means the month of Ramadan, and it encompasses the whole month, from its beginning to its end."" End quote from ""Sharh Bulugh Al-Maram"" (3/290).\nShaykh Ibn Jibrin (may Allah have mercy on him) stated in his ""Fatawa"" (24/9) with the numbering of Al-Shamilah:\n""Standing (in prayer) during Ramadan is achieved by praying a portion of every night, like half or a third of it, whether that is by praying eleven Rak`ahs or twenty-three, and standing (in prayer) is achieved by praying behind the Imam of the neighborhood until he departs, even if it is for less than an hour..."" End quote.\nFor those who miss standing (in prayer) during some nights of Ramadan; if it was due to an excuse that prevented them from doing so, then this virtue mentioned in the Hadith is hoped for them; due to the saying of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him): ""When a servant falls ill or travels, it will be written for him as if he was doing the deeds he used to perform when he was healthy and resident."" Reported by Al-Bukhari (2996).\nAl-Qastallani said:\n""Whoever stands (in prayer) during Ramadan"" all its nights, or some of them when he is unable to do so, and his intention was to pray if not for the obstacle."" End quote from ""Irshad As-Sari"" (3/425).\nHowever, if one leaves standing (in prayer) during some nights of Ramadan out of laziness, the apparent meaning of the Hadith is that he does not achieve the mentioned virtue.\nTherefore, it is upon a Muslim to be keen on praying Tarawih in congregation in the mosque, and if he is unable or preoccupied, he should pray at home to the best of his ability.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/293605/to-attain-the-virtue-of-the-night-prayer-must-one-pray-every-night
178430,"I am not married and my period comes regularly every month. But my problem is that it starts off yellow, tinged with beige and brown, and sometimes goes on for three or four days with pain in the lower abdomen, intense agitation and bad mood. Then it becomes black for one or two days at the most, then red blood comes for between five and seven days, then it goes back to a brown colour, then yellow, then after one or two days of the yellow discharge, sometimes there is a white discharge, the sign of purity (end of the period), or sometimes the yellow discharge continues until the next period, i.e., it lasts for a month.
My question is: when should I pray and when should I stop praying? When should I fast and when should I not fast?","['Praise be to Allah.Ruling on yellow discharges before period\nThe yellowish or brownish discharge that precedes the blood is not regarded as the menses; the same applies to that which comes after seeing the white discharge (that signals the end of the period), because Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “We used not to regard the yellowish brownish discharge after the white discharge (that signals the end of the period) as being of any significance.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 307; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Irwa’ Al-Ghalil, 199)\xa0\nRuling on yellow discharges after the bleeding and before the white discharge\nWith regard to yellowish and brownish discharge that comes after the bleeding and before the white discharge (that signals the end of the period), this is regarded as menses, because of the report narrated by Malik in Al-Muwatta’, 130, from Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her), according to which she said: The women used to send to `Aishah, the Mother of the Believers, small vessels containing the pieces of cotton on which there were yellowish traces from the menstrual blood, and they would ask her about praying, and she would say to them: Do not be hasty, wait until you see the white discharge, referring to that which signals the end of the period.\xa0\nThis was also narrated by Al-Bukhari in a mu`allaq report (Kitab Al-Hayd, Bab Iqbal Al-MahId wa Idbarihi; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Irwa’ Al-Ghalil, 198)\nBased on that, the yellowish or brownish discharge that lasts for three or four days before the bleeding starts is not regarded as menses, and you should not stop praying or fasting at that time.\xa0\nThe black blood and the red blood that comes after it, and the yellowish discharge, are menses, until you see the white discharge or complete dryness.\xa0\nIf you see the white discharge or complete dryness, then any discharge after that, yellowish or brownish, is not regarded as menses.\xa0\nRuling on the red blood that continues longer than 15 days\nIf the red blood continues, or the yellowish or brownish discharge that come after it, before the white discharge or complete dryness appear – if that goes on for longer than fifteen days, then you are experiencing Istihadah (irregular, non-menstrual bleeding), according to the majority of scholars.\nSome scholars say that Istihadah cannot be proven unless that continues for the entire month or for the entire month apart from two or three days. This is the view favoured by Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) and those who followed him and those who do not think there is any maximum length for the menses, and their view is closer to the apparent meaning of the evidence.\xa0\nIf it becomes clear that you are experiencing Istihadah , then in the following months you should act in accordance with your cycle as it was in the past. So you should stop praying and so on for the duration of bleeding, until the appearance of the white discharge (signalling the end of the period) that you mentioned in your question, then you should do Ghusl. For example, if your period, before experiencing Istihadah, used to last for ten days, then you should do Ghusl after the tenth day, and do Wudu at the time of each prayer.\xa0\nA woman who did not have a regular cycle before experiencing Istihadah should base her actions on differentiating between different kinds of bleeding. This has been explained in the answer to question no.\xa068818 \xa0\nOur advice to you is to consult a specialist doctor for treatment of these ongoing discharges.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/178430/can-you-pray-with-yellow-discharge-before-period
