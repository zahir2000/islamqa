150492,"I am a twenty-eight-year-old man, and I have had alopecia areata, which has caused me to lose my hair completely, since the age of eight years. Since then, I have been receiving local cortisone injections all over my head at regular intervals, which has a temporary effect, but afterwards my hair starts to fall out from other areas on my head. Please note that these injections are very painful, and with alopecia areata it is impossible to have natural hair transplants by taking follicles from elsewhere because the problem is not concentrated in one particular place. Is it permissible for me to have a synthetic hair transplant with hair of the same type and colour as my original hair?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt is permissible to have a hair transplant for one whose hair has fallen out due to sickness or an accident, because that comes under the heading of correcting a defect and restoring that which Allah, may He be exalted, created.\nIt says in a statement of the Islamic Fiqh Council belonging to the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC), which was held during its eighteenth session in Malaysia, 24-29 Jumada al-Akhirah 1428 AH/9-14 July 2007 CE regarding cosmetic surgeries, explaining what is permissible of such procedures:\nIt is permissible according to Islamic teachings to do essential and necessary cosmetic surgeries for the following purposes:\na. Restoring the appearance of a body part to the state in which it was created, because Allah, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning): {We have certainly created man in the best of stature} [at-Tin 95:4].\nb. Restoring the usual function of a body part.\nc. Repairing congenital defects such as: cleft palate (harelip), severely crooked nose, and birthmarks, removing extra fingers and teeth, and separating fused fingers, if their presence leads to physical or psychological harm.\nd. Repairing accidental (acquired) defects resulting from burns, accidents, sickness and other causes, such as: skin transplants and grafting, reshaping the breast completely if it has been removed completely or partially, if its size is so large or small that it leads to a pathological condition, and hair transplant in the event of hair loss, especially for women.\ne. Removing a congenital deformity that causes psychological or physical harm to a person. End quote.\nShaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Hair transplants can be done for one who is bald, by taking hair from the back of the head and implanting it in the affected place. Is that permissible?\nHe replied: Yes, it is permissible, because this comes under the heading of restoring what Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, created, and it comes under the heading of removing a defect. It does not come under the heading of purely cosmetic procedures or adding to what Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, created, so it does not come under the heading of changing the creation of Allah. Rather it comes under the heading of restoring what has been lost and removing a defect. The story is well known of the three men, one of whom was bald and said that he wanted Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, to restore his hair, so the angel touched him and Allah restored his hair, and gave him beautiful hair.""(Fatawa ‘Ulama’ al-Balad al-Haram\xa0p. 1185).\nThe hadith to which the shaykh (may Allah have mercy on him) referred was narrated by al-Bukhari (3277) and Muslim (2964).\nSecondly:\nIf it is not possible to transplant natural hair, as in the case referred to in the question, there is nothing wrong with transplanting synthetic hair, on condition that it is made of a pure (tahir) substance, and that no harm will result from that which will exacerbate the current harm.\nSome researchers are of the view that it is synthetic hair transplants that are haram. They gave as a reason for that the fact that they are akin to hair extensions, which are prohibited, because the synthetic hair will remain as it is and will not grow, and there are other reasons for it being prohibited, such as deceit and changing the creation of Allah, and harms that may result from it.\nAfter mentioning the reasons noted above, Dr. Salih ibn Muhammad al-Fawzan explained further, noting that this kind of transplant calls for the use of medicines that contain cortisone, which is harmful to the body, and Islamic teachings forbid harming oneself. But if it is possible to avoid this harm, and it is not possible to remedy baldness except by this means, then it may be said that it is permissible, based on what some jurists mentioned about it being permissible to add hair extensions or use wigs for one who is affected by baldness, because that comes under the heading of removing defects, and does not come under the heading of seeking to enhance beauty, especially if baldness results in psychological harm which cannot be dealt with except by transplanting synthetic hair. That is on condition that it is not made from any impure (najis) substance.""(Buhuth an-Nadwah at-Tibbiyyah in Imam [Muhammad ibn Sa‘ud Islamic] University, 1431 AH, Vol. 3, p. 2427).\nWhat appears to be the case – and Allah knows best – is that these hair transplants cannot be compared to hair extensions, because there is nothing to attach them to, because we are speaking about someone whose hair has fallen out completely.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about someone who took medicine and it led to her hair, or most of it, falling out, and she does not want to use a wig because she thinks that wigs are haram. He replied:\nUsing a wig in a case such as that described here, in which her hair has fallen out in such a way that there is no hope that it will grow back, we say that there is nothing wrong with using a wig in such a case, because in fact it is not being done to enhance beauty; rather it is done to remove a defect. Based on that, it does not come under the heading of hair extensions for which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) cursed the one who does that. Rather he cursed the woman who does hair extensions and the one who asks for them to be done. The woman who does hair extensions is the one who adds something to her hair. But in fact, this woman does not resemble the one who does hair extensions, because she is not seeking to enhance beauty or add to the hair with which Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, created her. Rather she wants to remove an acquired defect, and there is nothing wrong with that, because it comes under the heading of removing a defect, not enhancing beauty. There is a difference between the two matters.""(Fatawa Nur ‘ala ad-Darb, tape no. 3.)\nPlease see also the answer to question no. 141074 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/150492/ruling-on-synthetic-hair-transplant-for-one-who-has-alopecia-areata
429557,"I had a traffic accident; I struck a man and took him to the hospital, where I registered his information at the reception, and sat him in a chair and left him in the hospital. He did not appear to be in a bad state, and I did not expect that his injury would be serious and lead to death or internal bleeding. My greatest sin is that I did not follow up with him and contact his family, because I was scared; some of my papers and licences were missing, so I ran away. The man died when he was on the chair, because of the nurses’ neglect and my neglect, as I did not follow up with him. But the family of the deceased pardoned me after my family intervened and settled the matter amicably. What is the ruling, and what expiation must I offer?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIf the man died in the chair in which you seated him, then what appears to be the case is that his death resulted from the accident, and the ruling concerning traffic accidents is as follows:\nIf the driver was not at fault, meaning that the car was in good condition in terms of brakes and the like, which could have caused the accident, and he did not transgress the rules in terms of speeding and manner of driving – according to traffic regulations – and he could not have avoided the accident, and the injured person is the one who was at fault, then in this case nothing is required of the driver.\nBut if the driver made a mistake that caused the accident, and the one who was hit by the car died – such as if he was travelling above the permitted speed limit, or he could have avoided the accident but did not do so, then this is a case of accidental killing, and accidental killing requires two things: blood money (diyah) and expiation (kaffarah).\nSecondly:\nYou stated that the family of the victim have pardoned you, which means that the blood money is waived, but there remains expiation.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And never is it for a believer to kill a believer except by mistake. And whoever kills a believer by mistake - then the freeing of a believing slave and a compensation payment presented to the deceased\'s family [is required] unless they give [up their right as] charity}\xa0[an-Nisa’ 4:92].\nThe family of the victim have given up their right to the blood money or compensation payment, so that is waived, but the expiation remains. What is required is to fast for two consecutive months, because freeing a slave is not possible nowadays.\nThe scholars of the Permanent Committee were asked: In the case of expiation for accidental killing, is it permissible to give food to sixty poor persons, according to what one is able to afford, or must it be paid all in one go?\nThey replied: There is no option of giving food as expiation for accidental killing, because Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has mentioned only two things in that regard. The first option is freeing a slave, and the one who cannot free a slave must fast for two consecutive months. Allah, may He be exalted, says {And he who does not find [a slave] - then a fast for two months consecutively} [al-Mujadilah 58:4]. And Allah is the source of strength.

142697,"We are siblings, one son and three daughters. My mother wants to register her apartment in my brother’s name, and we agreed to that. When he acquires another apartment, which will be less expensive than my mother’s apartment, it will be for us, the daughters. My mother is afraid that she will die with a burden of sin. We have a brother through our father, and my father registered the apartment in my mother’s name a long time ago, but my mother paid for half of the price of the apartment from her own money. Will my half-brother inherit from her?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe basic principle is that it is obligatory to treat children equitably in terms of giving gifts, and it is haram to favour any of them over others, because of the report narrated by Bukhari (2587) and Muslim (1623) from an-Nu‘man ibn Bashir, who said: My father gave me some of his wealth and my mother, ‘Amrah bint Rawahah, said: I will not approve until you ask the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to bear witness. So my father went to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to ask him to bear witness to my gift. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to him: “Have you done this for all your children?” He said: No. He said: “Fear Allah and treat your children equitably.” So my father came back and took back the gift.\nThis applies to gifts from both the father and the mother.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him0 said in al-Mughni (5/389): The prohibition on favouring some children over others applies to the mother just as it applies to the father, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Fear Allah, and treat your children equitably.” And because she is one of the parents, so she is not allowed to favour some of her children over others, as also applies to the father. Moreover, what may result from the father’s favouring some of his children, namely jealousy and enmity, will also result from the mother’s favouring some of her children. Thus it is proven that the same ruling applies to her as to him. End quote.\nHowever, if all the children approve of the gift, and they are adults of sound mind, then that is permissible, because they have the right to do that.\nBased on that, if your sisters are mature and of sound mind, and they consent to giving the apartment to that brother, then there is no blame on the mother for doing that.\nThis applies if all the sisters agreed to completely give up their right to the apartment to their brother. But if the registering [of the apartment] was done for some purpose other than completely giving up their right, and the sisters’ intention was that the apartment should belong to them in the event of their brother moving to another apartment, then we do not advise doing that, unless there is something to guarantee the sisters’ rights in the event of their brother refusing to give up the apartment and move to another apartment. There is a difference between one who willingly gives up something completely, in which case there is no need for guarantees or documentation, and the case when forgoing something is done only on paper, for some purpose, whilst retaining all of one’s rights.\nSecondly:\nThe husband may give his wife whatever he wants of his wealth, and he is not obliged to treat her and her children equally. Whatever he gives to her becomes her property and is added to everything else that she owns, and her heirs inherit it from her.\nThe husband’s son is a stranger to his wife, meaning that he cannot inherit from her so long as there is no other reason based on kinship which would dictate that he inherits from her. Based on that, whatever estate your mother leaves behind will be for her children, and her husband’s son will not inherit anything from her.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/142697/is-it-permissible-for-the-mother-to-register-her-apartment-in-her-sons-name-with-the-consent-of-his-sisters
