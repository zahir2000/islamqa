386966,"I am married with 6 kids and live in Australia. My kids were praying 5 times a day but recently my oldest son left Islam and the rest have gone to praying 2 - 3 times a day. I have been telling my wife about making Hijrah but she refuses because of the fear of money and health. I have become weak in my eman coz my surroundings are full kafir with no Muslim friends or family to socialize with. She won\'t even move to a city with a bigger Muslim population coz of kids\' schooling. she refuses to come to an agreement. The only option I have been given is to take all the kids but the kids don\'t want to do anything without their mother. She tells me it\'s too late to make hijrah. Given my circumstances, can I make hijrah without my family as I don\'t see any hope being here any longer? Will I be accountable for making hijrah without my family?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThere is no doubt that the situation your children have ended up in is the harsh and heavy price that families pay as a result of living in non-Muslim countries, whether in the West or the East, which ultimately leads to the children becoming westernized or easternized, or following whatever their desires dictate, in a direction far from the Religion of Allah and His pleasure; except for those whom my Lord has mercy upon; and they are few.\nFor benefit, please see the answer to question no. 52893 .\nSecondly:\nWhat you are considering, migrating to a Muslim country and leaving your family and children behind, is not the ideal solution; because it involves neglecting the trust and responsibility of raising children, which is a significant matter.\nFrom `Abdullah ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: ""Each of you is a shepherd and is responsible for his flock: the ruler who governs the people is a shepherd and is responsible for them, a man is a shepherd over the members of his household and is responsible for them, a woman is a shepherd over her husband\'s house and children and is responsible for them, and a slave is a shepherd over his master\'s property and is responsible for it. So, all of you are shepherds and each of you is responsible for his flock."" Narrated by Al-Bukhari (2554) and Muslim (1829).\nAnd from Ma`qil ibn Yasar, who said: I heard the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) saying: ""There is no servant whom Allah has given responsibility over a flock, and he does not protect them with sincere advice, except that he will not find the fragrance of Paradise."" Narrated by Al-Bukhari (7150) and Muslim (142).\nTherefore, your staying with your family, advising them, striving in their upbringing and guidance, falls under the reform mentioned in the words of Allah (translation of the meaning):\n{I only intend reform as much as I am able. And my success is not but through Allāh. Upon Him I have relied, and to Him I return.} Hud (88).\nA Muslim sometimes faces situations in life where he is between two goods and chooses the better of them, or between two evils and chooses the lesser of them.\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n""The perfection of \'piety (scrupulousness)\' is for a person to know the better of two goods and the worse of two evils, and to know that the Shari`ah is built upon achieving and perfecting benefits, and eliminating and minimizing harms. Otherwise, one who does not weigh the benefits and harms of an action or inaction according to the Shari`ah might neglect obligations and commit prohibitions."" End quote from ""Majmu` al-Fatawa"" (10/512).\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n""The intelligent person should know that reason and Shari`ah mandate achieving and perfecting benefits and eliminating and minimizing harms. When an intelligent person faces a matter in which he sees both a benefit and a harm, he is obliged to do two things: a matter of knowledge and a matter of action. The matter of knowledge is to seek to understand which is more predominant between the two sides of benefit and harm. Once it becomes clear to him which is more predominant, he is obliged to choose what is better for him."" End quote from ""Al-Da\' wa Al-Dawa\'"" (p. 491).\nIn conclusion:\nThe first thing you should do, if you are unable to reform them in your place and they do not agree to move with you to a better country, is to try to get custody of the younger ones, whom you can take care of, control, and reform, and bring them back to the path of their Religion as much as possible and within your capacity. Move with them to a Muslim country, where you can live among (Muslim) people and where you can reform their Religion.\nIf you are unable to do so, then move with them to another region, in the midst of a Muslim community, where you can be stronger in establishing your Religion for yourself and reforming your children as much as you can.\nHowever, in any case, we see that your leaving your children behind - if you are unable to migrate with them - leaving them in the hands of your wife, whose condition you have described, is a kind of neglecting the trust; and the better thing to do, if you are unable to move with them, is to stay with them as a guide, educator, and advisor, striving to reform them and yourself, and your wife as much as you can; until Allah provides relief and a way out for you and them, and enables you to improve them and guide them, or they grow up, and your authority over them ceases, and you are unable to return them or reform anything from them; then at that time, you are on your own; and every soul is held in pledge for what it has earned.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/386966/he-fears-for-his-kids-in-non-muslims-lands
44696,"Did Prophet Muhammed (saw) apply surma (kohl) to his eyes? And are there any Hadiths that narrate this? In the USA kohl is banned as it causes lead poisoning (as they say). Can this be true? because I would like to apply it as well, as I suffer from poor vision.","['Praise be to Allah.In a number of Hadiths it is narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used kohl and commanded others to do so. For example it is narrated in the Musannaf of Ibn Abu Shaybah (may Allah have mercy on him), from the Hadith of Anas (may Allah be pleased with him), that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to apply kohl to his right eye three times, and to his left eye twice. This Hadith was classed as authentic by Al-Albani in As-Silsilah As-Sahihah no. 633. And it was proven in Sunan An-Nasa’i (5113) and Sunan Abu Dawud (3837) and elsewhere, from the Hadith of Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The best of your kohl is ithmid (antimony), for it makes the vision clear and makes the hair\xa0 grow.”\xa0\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Kohl protects the health of the eyes and gives strength and clarity of vision, and cleanses the eye of bad substances. In addition to that some types of kohl also serve as an adornment and if it is applied before going to bed this is even better, and ithmid is more efficacious than other types of kohl.” (Zad Al-Ma`ad, 4/281)\xa0\nIt says in Al-Mughni: “It is recommended to use kohl an odd number of times.” (Al-Mughni, 1/106)\nIt says in Al-Majmu`: “With regard to using kohl an odd number of times, there is a difference of scholarly opinion. It was said that it should be applied an odd number of times to one eye and an even number of times to the other, so that the total number will be odd. The correct view of the scholars who examined this issue is that it should be applied an odd number of times to each eye. Based on this, the Sunnah is to apply it three times to each eye.” (Al-Majmu` 1/334)\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthyamin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Some eye doctors say that kohl is harmful to the eyes and they advise not using it. What do you say to them?\xa0\nHe replied:\xa0\n“Ithmid (antimony) is known to be very good for the eyes. I do not know anything about other types of kohl. Trustworthy doctors are the ones whom we should consult on this matter.\xa0\nIt was said of Zarqa’ Al-Yamamah, who could see as far as three days, that when she was killed, they saw that all the veins of her eyes bore traces of this ithmid.” (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, vol. 17; Chapter on medical treatment and visiting the sick)\xa0\nFrom the above it is known that kohl is good and is not harmful to the eyes, rather it is beneficial. But there may be some kinds of modern, manufactured kohl that contain some chemical ingredients which may cause physical damage and remove some of the benefits of kohl. Hence people nowadays should look for pure kohl and not regard every kind of kohl available nowadays as beneficial.\nFor more details, please refer to the following answers: 67897 , 34552 , 103345 , 32556 , 118089 , 22922 , and 144957 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/44696/is-kohl-beneficial-to-the-eyes
327313,recently the Bank is asking for the house.,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIf you wish to keep the house, there is no harm in retaining it even with the payment of usurious interest to the bank. As you clarified in your first question, you purchased it through a mortgage, and we answered that you must repent from usury, and there is no harm in staying in the house.\nThe principle is that whoever buys something with a usurious loan, they own it along with the sin of usury, and if a person cannot avoid paying the usurious interest: it is permissible for them to pay it, along with repentance from the original prohibited transaction.\nSecondly:\nIf you do not wish to keep the house, and you do not have the money to pay off what you owe after the bank sells the house at a loss, it is permissible for you to approach the National Debt Assistance Center to take on the debt for you, and you pay them in installments, provided that they do not take any extra amount over what they will pay to the bank, otherwise, this is prohibited usury, and you must then keep the house and pay the bank to avoid entering into a new usurious transaction.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/327313/resorting-to-the-national-debt-assistance-center-on-defaulted-mortgage
81994,"There is a man who is religiously committed and regularly offers Nafl prayers, and he fears Allah as much as he can. But since he was small he has had the sickness of fulfilling his desire by imitating women and wearing their clothes. Is there any sin on him?","['Praise be to Allah.Ruling on men imitating women\nIslam forbids men to imitate women and women to imitate men , and in fact it emphatically forbids that, to such an extent that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed those who go against the human nature with which Allah created them.\xa0\nIt was narrated from Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed men who imitate women and women who imitate men, and he said: “Throw them out of your houses.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 5885)\xa0\nUndoubtedly one of the most obvious signs of an effeminate man is that he wears women’s clothing and imitates their ways.\xa0\nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed the man who wears women’s clothing and the woman who wears men’s clothing. (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 4098 and classed as authentic by An-Nawawi in Al-Majmu`, 4/469 and by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud)\xa0\n`Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed masculinized women. “Narrated by Abu Dawud, 4099; classed as good by An-Nawawi in Al-Majmu`, 4/469 and as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud)\xa0\nAl-Munawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \xa0\n“As An-Nawawi said, this indicates that it is prohibited for men to imitate women and vice versa, because if it is prohibited with regard to clothing then imitating them in one’s movements and tone of voice is even more abhorrent. So it is prohibited for men to imitate women and vice versa with regard to clothing that is unique to one’s sex, and the one who does that is subject to the threat of being cursed.” (Fayd Al-Qadir, 5/343)\xa0\nOnce this is established, we will know that the Islamic ruling on this kind of sexual perversion is that it is prohibited, and it is a major sin. So it is not permissible to do that whether alone or with one’s wife, because going against the sound human nature (Fitrah) that Allah has created in us can only result in corruption and evil. Allah has created man with masculine qualities that cannot go with wearing women’s clothing or imitating women’s mannerisms.\xa0\nUndoubtedly the one who seeks to be effeminate and derives pleasure from that and thinks that it fulfils his desire is sick with a disease that the doctors describe as a “fetish”. They have behavioural programs to treat such cases that are presented to them, so anyone who is faced with this problem should not hesitate to go to a psychologist to supervise his treatment for this sickness.\xa0\nRemedy to issue of men imitating women\nAll we can do is remind him of Allah and make his religious commitment a positive and effective factor in ridding him of this Waswas . He should remember the wrath of Allah towards effeminate men, and he should remember that He can see everything they do, and that this life is a few short days that will quickly cease to be, and a man will be left with his deeds in the Hereafter.\xa0\nWe remind him to seek the help of Allah, for He is the best of helpers and the best One to ask for help. If a person is sincere in his du’a’ and seeking help and turning to Him, Allah will answer his prayer and relieve him of his problem. But part of praying sincerely is sincerely applying the means and striving hard and being patient until full healing comes and he gives up these evil haram practices. And for his efforts and patience he will be rewarded by Allah, may He be glorified and exalted.\xa0\nThe best thing that will help him to give up this inclination is marriage, because it opens the door to satisfying sexual desires in good and permissible ways. Whilst he is waiting for that, he should distract himself from desires by filling his time with acts of worship and beneficial habits, and he should try to fast, because it is very helpful in controlling desires. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said concerning it: “Whoever cannot afford (to get married) should fast, for it will diminish his desire.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 1905 and Muslim, 1400)\xa0\nOne of the most important things that will help him is: respecting the sacred limits set by Allah, by refraining from looking at people’s `Awrahs and refraining from thinking of desires, because looking at prohibited things is the basis of every calamity, and that is what leads one to these bad, perverted habits that he sees among some perverts. \xa0\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \xa0\n“Looking generates thoughts, then thoughts generate ideas, then ideas generate desire, then desires generate will, then the will grows strong and resolves to do the deed, and then the deed will inevitably take place unless there is something to prevent it. Concerning this it was said that patience in lowering the gaze is easier than patience in bearing the pain that comes afterwards.” (Al-Jawab Al-Kafi, p. 106)\xa0\nIt should be noted that thinking about such perversions will inevitably lead to doing them, so it is essential to divert oneself from such thinking, and to distract oneself with permissible kinds of pleasure with one’s wife. He should not try to connect fulfilment of desire with those bad practices. That is the whispers of the Shaytan.\nUndoubtedly the best kind of pleasure is that which is achieved in accordance with the sound human nature with which Allah has created people.\xa0\nWe ask Allah to guide you to the straight path.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/81994/ruling-on-men-imitating-women
