480116,"I live and work in Germany, praise be to Allah. I have saved up some money, and I want to buy a gold ingot through the bank. I have an account with this bank, and the way to do it is either to buy online and they will keep a piece of gold in my name, and deduct the money from my account, or I can order it directly from the bank, and they will do the same thing [that is, keep it for me]. Is this permissible? Is it regarded technically as receiving the item, meaning that it could be considered the same as receiving it in my hand?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nWhen buying gold for cash, it is stipulated that the exchange must be done as soon as the transaction is concluded.\nThat is because of the report narrated by Muslim (1587) from ‘Ubadah ibn as-Samit (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Gold for gold, silver for silver, wheat for wheat, barley for barley, dates for dates, salt for salt, like for like, same for same, hand to hand. But if these commodities differ, then sell as you like, as long as it is hand to hand.”\nCurrencies come under the same rulings as gold and silver.\nIn a statement of the Islamic Fiqh Council belonging to the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC) it says:\nWith regard to the rulings on currencies, they are regarded as money because items are valued and priced on the basis of these currencies. They are subject to the same rulings as gold and silver with regard to riba (usury), zakah, sallam transactions (payment in advance) and all other rulings.\nEnd quote from Majallat al-Majma‘, issue no. 3, vol. 3, p. 1650; issue no. 5, vol. 3, p. 1609.\nWhat is meant by receiving money is receiving it in one’s hand in a real sense or in a technical sense, when it is deposited in the seller’s account.\nReceiving gold in a real sense means that you receive it yourself or through a proxy who is acting on your behalf.\nReceiving it in a technical sense means that the gold is deposited in an account that belongs to you in such a way that you are able to take the gold itself – not its value – from the account at any time after the deal is concluded.\nSo it is essential that the exchange of the two items (the money and the gold) takes place in the sitting in which the deal is concluded, meaning that the money goes into the seller’s account and you receive the gold in a real sense in your hand, or in the hand of the proxy acting on your behalf, or the gold is deposited in an account that belongs to you.\nIt says in al-Ma‘ayir ash-Shar‘iyyah (p.1330, no. 57) regarding gold: When selling gold for gold or for silver or for any other currency, the two items must be exchanged in the sitting in which the deal is concluded, either in a real sense or in a technical sense. End quote.\nIf the gold will not come into your account until after a while, or you cannot dispose of it until after a while, then the required exchange has not taken place, and the transaction comes under the heading of riba an-nasi’ah, which is haram.\nSecondly:\nIf the bank can buy the gold for you, and the bank is able to receive the gold in the same sitting in which the deal is concluded, then there is nothing wrong with that, as the bank will be acting as a proxy on your behalf.\nSimilarly, if the bank owns gold which you can buy from it, the exchange can be done on the spot, and the gold will go into an account that belongs to you in the same sitting, there is nothing wrong with that, because that is technically taking possession of it.\nBut if these exchange cannot be done on the spot, it is haram to buy the gold.\nThirdly:\nIslamic standards permit a type of technically receiving the gold when buying gold ingots. This is as follows:\nTechnically taking possession [of the gold] may be done by identifying a specific ingot and enabling the purchaser to take possession of it and dispose of it; or by issuing a certificate of ownership which proves ownership of a particular ingot which is distinguished from others (“allocated”) by means of numbers stamped on the ingot and similar markings that distinguish it from others, on condition that the certificate is issued on the day on which the transaction is done (Trade Date T+0) by an entity that is recognised by law and by custom, which allows the purchaser to take physical possession of the purchased ingot whenever he wishes.\nBased on that, it is not permissible to sell a non-specified ingot without the purchaser taking possession of it in a real sense. That includes what is known in the market as “unallocated” ingots. End quote.\nIf these guidelines are adhered to and implemented, it is permissible to buy the ingot from the website or from the bank, and the gold will be a trust that is held by the bank, but the bank will not be liable for it except in the case of wilful damage or negligence.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/480116/what-is-the-ruling-on-buying-gold-ingots-from-the-internet-or-the-bank-and-keeping-them-for-the-client
371193,"I heard someone say that all those who achieved conquests were Ash‘aris, such as Salaah ad-Din al-Ayyubi, Muhammad al-Faatih, ‘Umar al-Mukhtar, and others, and there was no one who was Salafi. Is this true?","['Praise be to Allah.Most of the conquests happened at the time of the earliest and best generations, such as the conquests of the Persians and the Byzantines, and the conquests of Syria, Egypt, North Africa, Andalusia, India and Sindh; in other words, from the ocean to the ocean. All of that happened before Abu’l-Hasan al-Ash‘ari was even born!\nBut after the era of al-Ash‘ari (d. 324 AH), whatever wars or conquests took place, people of mixed backgrounds took part in them, and whether the commander was a Salafi or an Ash‘ari or a Karrami, all kinds of people took part in them. For example, Ibn Qudamah and other people of Bayt al-Maqdis, who were Salafis, took part in campaigns with Salah ad-Din, and Ibn Taymiyah took part in the wars against the Tatars.\nThis argument is pointless and that there is no evidence in it to suggest that a certain school of thought (in ‘aqidah) is right or wrong. If conquest was proof of the soundness of a belief, then all of the early conquests would point to the soundness of the Salafi madhhab.\nBut what we may learn from this discussion is that when the ummah is faced with external danger, they unite, cooperate and set aside their differences, and the Salafis fight alongside the Ash‘aris and the Sufis to repel the enemy who, if they conquer the Muslim lands, will commit mischief without differentiating between one school of thought and another.\nAs for the one who has some innovated beliefs or practices, he may be excused if he based his innovation on his own efforts to reach a conclusion, or it was based on the misinterpretation of some text, or he followed a shaykh in that regard. So he is not to be punished for his innovation, and he may be rewarded for his good intention and efforts to reach the right conclusion, as well as his efforts in support of Islam. This is how Ahl as-Sunnah evaluate many of the scholars who were known for their knowledge, righteousness and jihad, if they belonged to a group that followed innovation. They seek excuses for them and think positively of them; they mention the virtues that they had and they note that they did not refrain from striving in jihad, whether the ruler was righteous or evil.\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Kathir said, in his biography of the righteous shaykh Abu ‘Umar al-Maqdisi:\n… He was the brother of Shaykh Muwaffaq ad-Din ‘Abdullah ibn Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Qudaamah. Abu ‘Umar was older than him, because he was born in 528 AH, in the village of as-Sawiya – or, it was said, in Jama‘il – and he raised Shaykh Muwaffaq ad-Din; he treated him kindly, helped him to get married and took care of him.…\nHe and his brother, and his maternal cousin al-Hafiz ‘Abd al-Ghani and his brother Shaykh al-‘Imad never stayed behind from any campaign in which the ruler Salah ad-Din went out to the land of the Franks. They were present with him at the conquest of al-Quds (Jerusalem) and on other campaigns.""(Al-Bidayah wa’n-Nihayah\xa0 17/21).\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nNot everyone who differs in some matters of creed is necessarily doomed. The one who differs (regarding some matters of creed) may have studied the religious texts but come to a wrong conclusion, and Allah may forgive his mistake. Or some text concerning that issue may not have reached him, on the basis of which proof could be established against him; or he may have some good deeds to his credit by means of which Allah will erase his bad deeds. If there is some word of warning in the religious texts that applies to him, of the type for which the one who misinterprets the text or repented, or the one who has good deeds that could erase his bad deeds is not included in the warning, then it is more appropriate [to believe that such people will not be doomed].""(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa (3/179). See also: Mihnah Ibn Taymiyah in ash-Shaamilah (34).\nWhatever the case, what matters is following the Qur’an and Sunnah, and the way of the Companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), for this is the criterion by which we may determine whether a belief is sound or not. As for jihad, it is something that a Khariji or Mu‘tazili or Sufi or Ash‘ari or Sunni may be involved in, and it is not indicative of the soundness of his belief.\nIn the modern era, the Salafis have fought in jihad, conquered lands and attained victory, and they are no less in that regard than others.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/371193/were-the-majority-of-the-islamic-conquests-carried-out-by-the-asharis
