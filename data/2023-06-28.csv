322524,"You mentioned the difference of scholarly opinion regarding ‘umrah and whether it is obligatory. If it is said that it is obligatory, then does the individual have believe that ‘umrah is obligatory when he intends to do it, or is the ‘umrah he did previously sufficient, even if he believed it was mustahabb (recommended) when he intended to do it?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nWe have previously mentioned the difference of scholarly opinion regarding ‘umrah in the answer to question no. 39524 , where we noted that the view favoured on our website is that it is obligatory once in a lifetime, like hajj.\nSecondly:\nIf someone did ‘umrah after reaching the age of puberty, in the correct manner, that is sufficient for him and he has done what is required of him, even if he believed that it is Sunnah and is not obligatory. That is because ‘umrah does not need to be accompanied by the belief that it is obligatory when intending to do it, or to specify whether one is doing ‘umrah as obligatory or Sunnah. Rather it is sufficient to intend to begin the rituals [by entering ihram].\nAl-Mawardi said in al-Hawi al-Kabir (2/92): All acts of worship are of three types:\nOne type which requires the intention to do the action and nothing else; another type which requires the intention to do the action and believe that it is obligatory and nothing else; and a third type which requires the intention to do the action, belief that it is obligatory and to specify what actually is to be done.\nAs for that which requires the intention to do the action, without believing that it is obligatory or specifying what is actually to be done, this applies to hajj, ‘umrah and purification. So when a person intends to do hajj or to do ‘umrah or to purify himself for prayer, that is valid, even if he does not intend that it is obligatory and specify what he is actually going to do… End quote.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/322524/he-did-umrah-believing-that-umrah-is-sunnah-then-he-realized-that-the-view-that-it-is-obligatory-is-the-correct-view-should-he-repeat-it
317960,"Is it permissible to appoint a pilgrim who is going to stay [in Mina until the 13th Dhul-Hijjah] to stone the jamarat on behalf of a pilgrim who is going to hasten his departure [and leave Mina on 12th Dhul-Hijjah], because it is difficult to reach the jamarat before sunset?","['Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to appoint someone else to stone the jamarat unless you are unable to do it because of sickness or old age that makes it difficult to go to the jamarat.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If a man is sick or detained, or has a valid excuse, it is permissible for him to appoint someone to stone the jamarat on his behalf.""(Al-Mughni\xa0\xa03/427).\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: There is nothing wrong with appointing someone to stone the jamarat on behalf of one who is sick, or a woman who is unable to do it because she is pregnant, or heavy, or weak, and is not able to stone the jamarat.""(Majmu‘ Fatawa Ibn Baz\xa0 17/301).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is not permissible for a woman or anyone else to appoint someone to stone the jamarat on her behalf, because stoning the jamarat is one of the actions of hajj, and Allah, may He be Blessed and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And complete the hajj and ‘umrah for Allah}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:196].\nHence the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) gave permission to the weak ones among his family to move on from Muzdalifah at night, so that they would reach Mina before the crowds and stone Jamrat al-‘Aqabah, but he did not give them permission to appoint someone to stone the jamarat on their behalf. Similarly, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) gave permission to the camel herders to stone the jamarat one day and not the next, and he did not give them permission to appoint someone else to stone them on their behalf. This indicates that it is a must for the pilgrim to stone the jamarat himself.""(Majmu‘ Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymin\xa023/107).\nAnd he said: If the pilgrim is not able to stone the jamarat either because of old age, or sickness, or the pilgrim is a woman who is pregnant, or a woman or man who is blind and it is too difficult for them to do it, then in this case there is nothing wrong with appointing someone else to do it on their behalf, because of necessity.""(Majmu ‘ Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymin\xa0 23/119).\nAs for hastening to depart [on 12th Dhul-Hijjah], that is not an excuse, because there is enough time from noon until sunset to stone the jamarat, no matter where he is in Mina, as is the case for thousands of people nowadays, who may be at the far edges of Mina and in Muzdalifah, but they are able to stone the jamarat and hasten their departure.\nIf a person has no excuse that would keep him from stoning the jamarat, it is not permissible for him to appoint someone else to do it on his behalf.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/317960/is-it-permissible-for-one-who-wants-to-hasten-his-departure-to-appoint-someone-else-to-stone-the-jamarat-because-it-is-difficult-for-him-to-reach-the-jamarat-before-sunset
391078,I want to do ‘umrah but I still owe a fidyah for wearing tailored clothing when I did Hajj. What is the ruling if I do ‘umrah before paying the fidyah?,"['Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with you doing ‘umrah even though you still owe a fidyah for Hajj.\nBut this fidyah is a debt that you owe, and you should hasten to pay it.\nThe fidyah for wearing tailored clothing is one of the following options: Slaughtering a sheep [and distributing the meat to the poor of the Haram], or feeding six poor persons, or fasting for three days, because Allah, may He be exalted, says regarding the fidyah for one who has an ailment (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And whoever among you is ill or has an ailment of the head [making shaving necessary must offer] a ransom of fasting [three days] or charity or sacrifice}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:196].\nThe fidyah for wearing tailored clothes is the same as that, by analogy.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/391078/is-it-permissible-for-him-to-do-umrah-when-he-owes-a-fidyah-for-hajj
