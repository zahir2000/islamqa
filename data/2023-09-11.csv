427817,When were Surat al-Falaq and Surat an-Nas revealed? Is the hadith about the eleven knots which were tied to bewitch the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) sahih?,"['Praise be to Allah.The hadiths indicate that the Mu‘awwidhatayn (Al-Falaq) and An-Nas) were revealed in Madinah.\nThis is mentioned in the hadith of ‘Uqbah ibn ‘Amir, who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Do you not see verses that have been revealed tonight, the like of which has never been seen? {Say, ""I seek refuge in the Lord of daybreak} [Al-Falaq 113] and {Say, ""I seek refuge in the Lord of mankind} [An-Nas 114].”\n‘Uqbah ibn ‘Amir (may Allah be pleased with him) accompanied the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in Madinah, and these two surahs were revealed after the bewitching incident.\n‘Abd ibn Humayd narrated in al-Muntakhab (1/228): Ahmad ibn Yunus told me: Abu Mu‘awiyah told us, from al-A‘mash, from Yazid ibn Hayyan, from Zayd ibn Arqam, who said: A Jewish man bewitched the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and he fell sick. Jibril came to him, bringing down al-Mu‘awwidhatayn, and said: A Jewish man has bewitched you, and the item used for witchcraft is in the well of So-and-so. So he sent ‘Ali, who brought it to him, then he instructed him to untie the knots and recite verses, so he started reciting and untying, until the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) got up as if he had been released from restraints. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not say anything to that Jewish man about what he had done to him, and he never confronted him with it.\nThe narrators of this isnad are trustworthy (thiqat); it was classed as sahih by the commentators on the book, and by Shaykh al-Albani in as-SIlsilah as-Sahihah (6/617).\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar said:\nHe said: Because of that, al-Mu‘aawidhatayn were revealed. End quote.\nThis was narrated by ath-Tha‘labi from Ibn ‘Abbas in a mu‘allaq report, and from ‘A’ishah, also in a mu‘allaq report.\nThe isnad going back to ‘A’ishah is sahih. It was narrated by Sufyan ibn ‘Uyaynah in his Tafsir from Abu ‘Ubaydillah, from Hisham ibn ‘Urwah, from his father, from ‘A’ishah. In it, it says: And {Qul a‘udhu bi Rabb il-falaq} [Surat al-Falaq] was revealed.""(At-Talkhis al-Habir\xa0 6/2689).\nAs for the number of knots being eleven, no sahih hadith has been narrated concerning that.\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAs-Suhayli stated that the number of knots was eleven, so it was appropriate that the number of verses of the Mu‘awwidhatayn should be eleven, so that with every verse, one knot was undone.\nI say: al-Bayhaqi narrated in ad-Dala’il something similar with a da‘if isnad, in the story in which it is said that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was bewitched… At the end of the hadith, it says that they found a string in which there were eleven knots, and Surat al-Falaq and Surat an-Nas were revealed, so every time he recited a verse, one knot came undone.\nIbn Sa‘d narrated with a munqati‘ (interrupted) isnad from Ibn ‘Abbas that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) sent ‘Ali and ‘Ammar, and they found a string in which there were eleven knots, and he mentioned a similar report.""(At-Talkhis al-Habir\xa06/2689-2690).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/427817/when-were-surat-al-falaq-and-surat-an-nas-revealed
432890,"Someone wanted to defraud me, so he gave me some money so as to entice me to give him my money [as an investment] so that he could multiply it for me, and I kept the money that he gave me. Is this money haram?","[""Praise be to Allah.With regard to the money that you received from this person, if it was a gift, then you do not have to return it.\nBut if it was a loan, or something entrusted to you for safekeeping, or a partnership, then you must return it to him, and it is not permissible to keep it on the grounds that he wanted to defraud you, because it is haram to take people’s wealth unlawfully and it is haram to take wealth unless it is given willingly by its owner.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{ O you who have believed, do not consume one another's wealth unjustly but only [in lawful] business by mutual consent}\xa0[An-Nisa’ 4:29].\nAnd the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “It is not permissible to take the wealth of a Muslim except with his willing consent.” Narrated by Ahmad (20172); classed as sahih by al-Albani in Irwa’ al-Ghalil (1459).\nAnd the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Your blood, your wealth and your honour are sacred to one another.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (1739) and Muslim (1679).\nAnd the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Render back the trust to the one who entrusted it to you, and do not betray the one who betrayed you.” Narrated by Abu Dawud (3534); classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud.\nIt says in ‘Awn al-Ma‘bud (9/327): To sum up, the trust can never be betrayed, because the one who entrusted it to you is either honest or dishonest, but whatever the case, you must not betray it. End quote.\nSo what you must do is return the money to its owner, so long as it was not a gift.\nEven if it was a gift, but you found out his intention, then it was not a true gift and was not given for the sake of Allah or because of friendship between you, or from other noble reasons. So the best is for you to refrain from keeping his money, and to return it to him, and if you tell him what you found out and denounce his actions, that will be better.\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/432890/should-he-return-money-to-the-person-who-tried-to-trick-him-and-defraud-him
