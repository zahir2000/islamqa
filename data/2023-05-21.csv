269847,"I have a question regarding the Historical context of Surah Nisa, Ayat 34. I have gone through Tafsir Ibn Kathir and the Shades of the Quran by Sayid Qutubuddin but did not get any information regarding the historical context. Could you, therefore, kindly provide me the information When was Surah Nisa Ayat 34 revealed? Why was it revealed? In response to whose action was it revealed? I extemely grateful if you can help me in this regards.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Men are in charge of women because Allah has made one of them excel the other and because of what they spend [for maintenance] from their wealth. So righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in [the husband\'s] absence what Allah would have them guard. But those [wives] from whom you fear defiant disobedience - [first] advise them; [then if they persist], forsake them in bed; and [finally], strike them. But if they obey you [once more], seek no means against them. Indeed, Allah is ever Exalted and Great}\xa0[an-Nisa’ 4:34].\nThis affirms that the man is in charge of the woman and has the authority to discipline her if he fears defiant disobedience on her part.\nAllah, may He be exalted, mentions two reasons for the man being in charge of the woman, one of which is something that He has bestowed on the man, which is causing him to excel over the woman; and the other is what the man attains through his efforts, which is his spending and his wife.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{because Allah has made one of them excel the other and because of what they spend [for maintenance] from their wealth }\xa0[an-Nisa’ 4:34].\nAnd He, may He be glorified, has mentioned this qawamah [men being in charge of women] elsewhere, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And due to the wives is similar to what is expected of them, according to what is reasonable. But the men have a degree over them [in responsibility and authority]. And Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:228].\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his Tafsir (1/363): The words {But the men have a degree over them} mean: they are superior to them both physically and psychologically, in status and in obedience to Allah’s command, in spending and in taking care of various matters, and in the fact that they attain greater virtue in this world and the hereafter, as Allah, may He be exalted, says elsewhere:\n{Men are in charge of women because Allah has made one of them excel the other and because of what they spend [for maintenance] from their wealth}\xa0[an-Nisa’ 4:34]. End quote.\nHe also said: \xa0(1/635):\nThe words {Men are in charge of women} mean that the man is in charge of the woman; in other words, he is her leader and superior, and he has authority over her and is the one to discipline her if she drifts away.\n{because Allah has made one of them excel the other} that is, because men are superior to women and men are better than women. Hence prophethood was only granted to men, and the position of ruler or head of state is also only for men, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “No people will ever prosper who appoint a woman in charge of their affairs.” Narrated by al-Bukhari from ‘Abd ar-Rahman ibn Abi Bakrah, from his father. The same applies to the position of judge and other positions.\n{and what they spend [for maintenance] from their wealth} that includes dowries, maintenance and other spending that Allah has made obligatory for men to spend on women in His Book and the Sunnah of His Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Thus the man is inherently superior to the woman, and has an extra advantage over her because of what he spends on her maintenance. Therefore it is appropriate for him to be in charge of her, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {But the men have a degree over them [in responsibility and authority]…} [al-Baqarah 2:228].\n‘Ali ibn Abi Talhah narrated that Ibn ‘Abbas said: {Men are in charge of women} means that they are their leaders, so the woman must obey the man in what he instructs her to do. Obedience to him means that she should be kind to his family and take good care of his wealth. End quote.\nAl-Baydawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his Tafsir (2/184): {Men are in charge of women}, so there are to take care of them as rulers take care of their subjects.\nThe reason for that is twofold; it is because of what Allah has bestowed and because of the men’s efforts, as Allah says: {because Allah has made one of them excel the other}, because of the advantage that He, may He be exalted, has given to men over women, by granting them reason and wisdom, and greater physical strength to do good deeds and acts of worship. Hence certain things are granted only to men, such as prophethood, rulership, positions of authority, leading acts of worship, giving testimony in various legal cases, fighting in jihad, being obliged to attend Jumu‘ah prayers and the like, having a greater share of inheritance, and having the authority to issue divorce (talaq).\n{and what they spend [for maintenance] from their wealth} including what they spend on them when they marry them, such as the dowry and maintenance.\xa0End quote.\nAz-Zuhayli said: The man is in charge of the woman, meaning that he is her leader and superior, and he has authority over her and is the one to discipline her if she drifts away. He is the one who is in charge of her, so he protects her and takes care of her. It is he who must engage in jihad, not her, and he receives double her share of inheritance, because he is the one who is obliged to spend on her.\nThe reason why men are in charge is twofold:\nFirstly, the man has a physical advantage, because he is physically perfect, has strong powers of reasoning and the ability to understand things, is emotionally stable, and is physically sound. Therefore men excel women in reasoning, wisdom, resolve and strength; hence only men may be messengers, prophets, rulers and judges, and only men may carry out certain rituals such as the adhan, iqamah, khutbah, Jumu‘ah and jihad; only the man has the authority to issue divorce (talaq) and is permitted to marry multiple wives; only men may give testimony with regard to injuries and hadd punishments; and men receive a greater share of inheritance and may inherit as residual heirs [male relatives on the father’s side].\nSecondly, the man is obliged to spend on his wife and female relative, and he is obliged to pay the dowry, which is a gesture intended to honour the woman.\nApart from that, men and women are equal in terms of rights and duties. This is one of the beauties of Islam. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And due to the wives is similar to what is expected of them, according to what is reasonable. But the men have a degree over them [in responsibility and authority]}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:228].\nIn other words, men have a degree over them in managing the household and keeping an eye on the family’s affairs, guiding them and watching them.""(At-Tafsir al-Munir\xa0 5/54).\nSecondly:\nThere are da‘if (weak) hadiths one of which was narrated by at-Tabari (may Allah have mercy on him) in his Tafsir (8/291) from al-Hasan, according to which a man slapped his wife, so she came to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and he wanted to let her retaliate, but Allah revealed the words: {Men are in charge of women because Allah has made one of them excel the other and what they spend [for maintenance] from their wealth}. So the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) called the man and recited this verse to him, then he said: “I wanted one thing but Allah wanted something else.”\nThe isnad is sahih up to al-Hasan, but al-Hasan was a Tabi‘i, so the hadith is mursal, and mursal is a kind of da‘if (weak) hadith.\nMuqatil said: This verse was revealed regarding Sa‘d ibn ar-Rabi‘, who was one of the leaders of the Ansar. His wife was Habibah bint Zayd ibn Abi Hurayrah; they were both among the Ansar. She was defiantly disobedient towards him, so he slapped her…\nThirdly:\nWith regard to the context of the verse and how it is connected to the verses that come before it, Allah, may He be exalted, mentioned the reason why men are caused to excel over women, after stating the share of inheritance for each of them and forbidding both men and women to wish for that in which some of them have been caused to excel over others.""(At-Tafsir al-Munir ibn az-Zuhayli\xa0 5/45).\nThis is a reference to the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And do not wish for that by which Allah has made some of you exceed others. For men is a share of what they have earned, and for women is a share of what they have earned. And ask Allah of his bounty. Indeed Allah is ever, of all things, Knowing}\xa0[an-Nisa’ 4:32].\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/269847/what-is-meant-by-men-meant-being-in-charge-of-women-qawamah-and-the-reason-for-that
240066,"Is it permissible to take a loan from one of the banks in Saudi which has a scholarly committee that allows a specific increase, and to take the money to make a down payment for purchasing a piece of land in my city in Egypt by instalments, then take possession of it after a year for the purpose of building on it or selling it?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt is not permissible for the lender to stipulate in a loan contract that the borrower must pay back the loan with more than he took. The scholars are unanimously agreed that any loan which brings a benefit to the lender is riba.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Mughni (4/240):\nAny loan in which it is stipulated that more should be paid back is haram, and there is no difference of scholarly opinion on that. Ibn al-Mundhir said: They (the scholars) are unanimously agreed that if the lender stipulates that the borrower must pay back more or give him a gift, and he gives the loan on that basis, then accepting the extra amount on that basis is riba.\nIt was narrated from Ubayy ibn Ka‘b, Ibn ‘Abbas and Ibn Mas‘ud that they forbade loans that bring benefits. End quote.\nSecondly:\nIt is permissible to make the borrower pay the costs of issuing the loan and other related services, on condition that the amount paid is equal to the real costs involved in issuing the loan. If the amount paid is greater than the real costs of issuing the loan, then that additional amount is riba.\nIt says in a statement of the Islamic Fiqh Council (no. 13 (1/3)):\nFirstly: it is permissible to charge a fee for issuing loans, provided that it is within the limits of the actual costs. Secondly: anything more than the actual cost of this service is haram, because it comes under the heading of riba, which is prohibited according to Islamic teachings. End quote.\nWhat confirms that administrative fees are not greater than the actual costs of administration is when the fees are not increased when the amount of the loan is increased, or when payment is delayed.\nShaykh Yusuf ash-Shubayli (may Allah preserve him) said:\nIf the stipulated increase to be paid to the bank is connected to the length of time taken to pay back the loan, or is connected to the value of the loan, then it is haram, whether it is to be paid to the bank in instalments (0.5% to be paid annually, for example) or it is to be paid in one go when taking out the loan or when paying it back, and regardless of whether it is called interest or services or fees, or any other name. When drawing up the contract, what matters is what the clauses really mean, not how they are phrased.\nBut if the extra amount that is stipulated is a set amount and is not impacted by the value of the loan or how long it takes to pay it back – such as if the bank charges a set fee to issue a loan, such as one hundred and fifty dinars for example – then what appears to be the case is that this transaction is permissible, whether payment of these fees is separate from paying off the loan, or it is added to the total value of the loan. That is because in reality, these fees are not additional to the loan; rather they are fees that the bank is entitled to charge in return for the work done in order to issue the loan, such as phone calls, messages, employee salaries, and so on, which is work for which the bank has the right to charge fees, according to Islamic teachings.
