284278,"Is it true that Imam ash-Shafa‘i (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “If this surah was the only surah to be revealed, it would have been sufficient for the people”? In which book did he say this?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThese words were narrated from Imam ash-Shafa‘i (may Allah be pleased with him) by more than one of the scholars. See: Tafsir al-Imam ash-Shafa‘i (3/1461), Majmu‘ al-Fatawa (28/152), Tafsir Ibn Kathir (1/203) and at-Tahrir wa’t-Tanwir (30/528).\nThere are a number of versions of this comment, but they all boil down to the same meaning. These versions include the following:\n1.. “If Allah had not sent down any proof after which people can have no excuse except this surah, that would have been sufficient for them.”\n2.. “If the people reflected on this surah, that would have been sufficient for them.”\nSecondly:\nThis surah begins with Allah swearing by al-‘asr – which is the time in which man lives, which contains wonders and signs that point to the might and wisdom of Allah – that mankind is in a state of loss (and decline) except those who attain four characteristics, namely: faith, righteous deeds, advising one another to hold fast to the truth and advising one another to be patient.\nSee: at-Tafsir al-Munir (30/390), and Asma’ Suwar al-Qur’an wa Fada’iluha, by Munirah ad-Dawsari (p. 592).\nThirdly:\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: [In this surah,] Allah, may He be exalted, divided humanity into two categories, losers and winners. The winner is the one who does what is beneficial to himself, by believing and doing righteous deeds, and shows sincerity to people by advising them to hold fast to the truth, which includes teaching them and trying to show them the right path. And he advises them to be patient, including himself in this advice. Thus the surah refers to showing sincerity towards oneself and towards others, and striving to perfect oneself and others, and to attain a perfect level in adhering to both truth and patience, in the most concise and elegant words, beautifully put together, reflecting a gentle approach.\nThe two types of sincerity are sincerity to one’s own self and to one’s brother in advising adherence to the truth and patience in doing so.\nThe two types of perfection are perfecting one’s own self and perfecting one’s brother.\nAs for attaining a perfect level in adhering to both truth and patience, that should be based on knowledge and proper understanding, and that is to be perfected through faith, willpower, love and striving in doing righteous deeds, and that cannot be done except through patience.\nHere we have six components:\nThree that a person should strive to attain himself and enjoin others to attain them: perfecting his knowledge through faith, perfecting his actions by doing righteous deeds, and persisting in that by means of patience.\nHe should enjoin others to do these three things too, so he complies with them and tells others to comply with them. Thus they become part of his character, and he teaches them to others and calls people to them.\nThis is the ultimate winner, and whatever he misses out on of winning is commensurate with what he missed out on with regard to these qualities, and he will incur losses. Allah is the One Whom we ask for help and on Him we rely.""(Al-Kalam ‘ala Mas’alat as-Sama‘\xa0 279).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/284278/what-imam-ash-shafai-said-about-surat-al-asr-and-its-being-sufficient-for-people
20069,What is the concept of engagement in Islam? Usually an engagement party is one in which the fiance/fiancee exchange rings. Is this the prescribed method in the shariah?,"['Praise be to Allah.What is engagement in Islam?\nEngagement in Islam means that a man asks to marry a woman and is accepted. The view of the scholars is that engagement is prescribed for one who wants to get married. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0{And there is no sin on you if you make a hint of betrothal…}\xa0[Al-Baqarah 2:235]\nIt was narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) got engaged to `Aishah. (Al-Bukhari, An-Nikah, 4793) It is also stated in Al-Bukhari and Muslim\xa0 that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) got engaged to Hafsah. (Al-Bukhari, An-Nikah, 4830)\xa0\nLooking at prospective wife I Islam\nThe Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) encouraged the one who wants to get engaged to look at the woman to whom he wishes to propose . According to the Hadith, “When any one of you proposes marriage to a woman, if he can look at that which will encourage him to go ahead and marry her, then let him do so.” (Abu Dawud, An-Nikah, 2082; classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud, 1832)\xa0\nProhibited Practices in Engagement in Islam\nBut in Islamic Shari`ah there are no specific practices that must be followed with regard to engagement. What some Muslims do, announcing the engagement, having a party to celebrate and exchanging gifts, all comes under the heading of customs which are permissible in principle, and none of them are prohibited except those which Shari`ah indicates are prohibited – which includes the exchange of rings between the engaged couple , a custom which is known in Arabic as “Diblah.” This custom goes against Shari`ah for the following reasons:\xa0\n\nSome people think that these rings increase the love between the spouses and have an effect on their relationship. This is an ignorant (Jahili) belief and is an attachment to something for which there is no basis in Shari`ah and which does not make sense. \xa0\nThis custom involves imitating the non-Muslims such as Christians and others. It is not a Muslim custom at all. The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) warned us against that when he said, “You will inevitably follow the paths of those who came before you, handspan by handspan, cubit by cubit, until even if they entered the hole of a lizard, you will follow them.” We said, “O Messenger of Allah,\xa0 (do you mean) the Jews and Christians?” He said, “Who else?” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, Al-I`tisam bil Kitab was-Sunnah, 6889 and Muslim, Al-`Ilm, 6723)\xa0\n\nAnd the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever imitates a people is one of them.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, Al-Libas, 4031; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud, 3401)\n\nThis engagement usually takes place before the marriage contract , in which case it is not permissible for the man to put the ring on his fiancée’s hand himself, because she is still a stranger (non-Mahram) to him, and has not yet become his wife.\xa0\n\nFinally, we will quote the words of Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) on this matter:\xa0\n“‘Diblah’ is a word that refers to the engagement ring. In principle there is nothing wrong with rings (i.e., they are permissible), unless they are accompanied by certain beliefs, as some people do when the man writes his name on the ring that he gives to his fiancée, and the woman writes her name on the ring that she gives to her fiancé, believing that this will guarantee the bonds between the spouses. In this case this ‘Diblah’ or engagement ring is haram, because it represents an attachment to something for which there is no basis in Shari`ah and which does not make sense. Similarly it is not permissible for the man to put the ring on the woman’s hand himself, because she is not yet his wife, so she is still a stranger (i.e., non-mahram) to him; she is not his wife until after the marriage contract is done.” (Al-Fatawa Al-Jami`ah lil Mar’ah Al-Muslimah, 3/914).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20069/engagement-in-islam
8991,"The custom in our country is to put a stone, concrete or a peg at the head and foot of the grave, or sometimes just at the head. What is the Islamic ruling on that?","['Praise be to Allah.Prohibition on building structures over graves\nIslam forbids building structures over graves , and commands that any such structures should be knocked down. But it is permitted to put a marker on the grave so that the family and friends of the deceased will know where it is. However, this marker should not be a structure or anything else that is not allowed in the Shari`ah.\xa0\nEvidence for the prohibition on building structures over graves\nWith regard to the prohibition on building structures over graves , the evidence for that is as follows.\xa0\nIt was narrated that Jabir said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade plastering over graves, sitting on them and building structures over them.\xa0(Narrated by Muslim, 970)\nAsh-Shawkani (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0“The phrase “building structures over them: indicates that it is haram to build anything over a grave .\xa0\nAsh-Shafi`i (may Allah have mercy on him) and his companions made the following distinction: if the structure is built on the property of the person who builds it, it is disliked, and if it is in a public graveyard, it is prohibited.\xa0However, there is no evidence for making this distinction.\xa0\nAsh-Shafi`i said: I saw the Imams in Makkah ordering that what had been built (over graves ) was to be knocked down.\xa0\nThe Hadith of `Ali also indicates that such structures should be destroyed.” (Nayl Al-Awtar, 4/132; the view of Ash-Shafi`i is mentioned in Al-Umm, 1/277)\xa0\nThe Hadith of `Ali referred to will be quoted below.\nEvidence for the command to knock down structures built over graves\nWith regard to the command to knock down structures that have been built over graves , that is proven in the Sunnah.\xa0\n\nIt was narrated that Abul-Hayaj As-Asadi said: `Ali ibn Abu Talib said to me: “Shall I not send you on the same mission as the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sent me? Do not leave any statue without erasing it, and do not leave any raised grave without leveling it.”\xa0 (Narrated by Muslim, 969).\xa0\n\nAsh-Shawkani (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\nThe words “do not leave any raised grave without leveling it” means that the Sunnah is that a grave should not be made very high, and there should be no differentiation between those who were virtuous and those who were not virtuous.\xa0\nIt seems that making a grave higher than the amount that is permitted is prohibited. This was clearly stated by the companions of Ahmad and a group of the companions of Ash-Shafi`i and Malik.\xa0\nThe view that it is not prohibited because the earlier and later generations did that without anyone denouncing that action, as Imam Yahya and Al-Mahdi said in Al-Ghayth, is not correct, because the most that can be said is that they kept quiet about it, and keeping quiet does not count as evidence if it has to do with matters which are not definitive, and the prohibition of making graves high is not definitive.\xa0\nMaking graves high that is mentioned in the Hadith especially includes the domes and shrines that are built over graves, and the taking of graves as places of worship. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed those who do that. (Nayl Al-Awtar, 4/130)\xa0\nAre gravestones prohibited in Islam?\nWith regard to it being permissible to mark a grave with something permissible, there is evidence in the Sunnah which explains that.\xa0\nIt was narrated from Kathir ibn Zayd Al-Madani that Al-Muttalib said: When `Uthman ibn Madh`un died, his bier was brought out and he was buried, then the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) ordered a man to bring a rock but he was not able to carry it. So the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stood up and rolled up his sleeves. Kathir said: Al-Muttalib said: the one who narrated that to me from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: it is as if I can see the whiteness of the arms of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when he rolled up his sleeves. Then he carried it and placed it at the head (of the grave), and said, “From this I will recognize the grave of my brother, and I can bury those among my family who die near him.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 3206)\xa0\nThe chain of narrators\xa0 of this Hadith was classed as sound by Al-Hafidh ibn Hajar in At-Talkhis Al-Habir, 2/133)\xa0\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\nThere is nothing wrong with marking a grave with a stone or a piece of wood. There is nothing wrong with a man marking a grave so that he will know where it is. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) marked the grave of `Uthman ibn Madh`un.

481957,What is the ruling on going to a wedding feast without an invitation?,"['Praise be to Allah.With regard to attending a wedding feast without invitation, there are different scenarios:\n-1-\nThe first scenario is where the feast is only for those whom the host has invited, as is the case with many wedding feasts nowadays.\nIn this case, it is not permissible to attend except by invitation or with the permission of the host of the wedding feast.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{O you who believe, do not enter the houses of the Prophet, unless you are given permission [and are invited] to come for a meal; and do not enter in hopes of getting a meal and waiting for it to be prepared. But if you are invited, then enter}\xa0[Al-Ahzab 33:53].\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThen Allah makes an exception from that, as He says: {unless you are given permission [and are invited] to come for a meal; and do not enter in hopes of getting a meal and waiting for it to be prepared}.\nMujahid, Qatadah and others said: That is, not waiting until the food is ready. In other words, do not watch out for food, until it is almost ready, then you enter. This is something that Allah dislikes and condemns.\nThis indicates that it is prohibited to impose on others, which is what is known as being an uninvited guest. Al-Khatib al-Baghdadi wrote a book condemning those who impose on others, and told many stories about such people, which would take too long to quote here.""(Tafsir Ibn Kathir\xa0 6/454).\nIt says in Sharh al-Khurashi ‘ala Mukhtasar Khalil (3/304):\nA person who has not been invited should not enter except with permission. This means that if someone comes to the place where a wedding feast is being held without an invitation, he should not enter except with permission, and it is not permissible for him to enter, whether he eats or not. End quote.\nIt says in al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah al-Kuwaitiyyah (20/335):\nImposing on people without an invitation:\nIt is not permissible for one who has not been invited to attend wedding feasts or other events, because doing so is unseemly and humiliating oneself, and that is not befitting for a believer…\nThe one who does that is called an uninvited guest or one who imposes on others.\nBased on that, imposing on others is prohibited according to the majority of jurists, unless the uninvited person is a subordinate or attendant of an invited guest who is a prominent figure, and it is known that he does not usually attend events on his own. In that case, it is not prohibited, because the attendant is implicitly included in the invitation to the one whom he serves… End quote.\nAn exception is made if the one who comes without an invitation knows that the host of the wedding feast would be happy to see him, because of ties of friendship or kinship between them, or because he knows that the host is generous and is always happy to welcome guests.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n… But if you know that your friend would be happy to see you, then this is not imposing on him; rather it is a type of kindness and humility on your part. There are many people for whom your coming without an invitation is something more beloved to him, and he will be very happy and will express his joy at that.""(Ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘\xa0 15/428).\n-2-\nThe second scenario is where it is the custom for the host of the wedding feast to give permission to everyone, and he does not prepare food only for those whom he has invited. In this case, there is nothing wrong with one who was not invited attending the feast and eating.\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIslamic teachings say that implicit permission is like explicit permission.""(Madarij as-Salikin\xa0 2/1019).\nIt says in Mughni al-Muhtaj (4/410):\nIt is prohibited to impose yourself, which means attending the wedding feast without being invited, unless you are certain that the host will be pleased with that, because of strong ties of friendship.\nImam [al-Juwayni] restricted that to when the invitation is limited to certain people.\nBut in the case of an invitation that includes everyone, such as when the door is open for whoever wishes to come in [“open house”], then that is not regarded as imposing on others.

119056,Is dealing in gifts and teddy bears prohibited?,"['Praise be to Allah.Is it permissible to sell gifts and toys?\nIt is permissible to deal in products that people give as gifts, such as toys , flowers, cards and the like, provided that they do not involve anything prohibited such as music or images or pictures of animate beings , and do not help in anything prohibited, such as gifts for Valentine’s Day , Christmas , Halloween and so on. This is because it is not permissible to sell anything that is prohibited or helps in anything prohibited, as Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {Help you one another in Al-Birr and At-Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression. And fear Allah. Verily, Allah is Severe in punishment.} [Al-Ma’idah 5:2]\xa0\nAre teddy bears prohibited in Islam?\nWith regard to toys and teddy bears, if they are for children, there is nothing wrong with dealing in them, because there is a concession allowing playing with dolls , and because concessions are granted in the case of children that are not granted in the case of adults.\xa0\nBut if they are bought by adults to decorate their living rooms and cars, then it is not permissible to sell them to them.\nAl-Bukhari and Muslim narrated that `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: I used to play with dolls in the house of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and I had friends who would play with me… (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 613 and Muslim, 2440)\nAl-Hafidh Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Fat-h: “This Hadith is quoted as evidence for the permissibility of keeping dolls and toys so that girls can play with them. That is excluded from the general meaning of the prohibition on keeping images. This was the view of `Iyad, who narrated it from the majority. They regarded it as permissible to sell toys for girls in order to teach them from an early age how to take care of their houses and their children in the future.\xa0\nIbn Hibban wrote a chapter entitled: Permissibility of little girls playing with toys… – according to a report of Jarir from Hisham: [`Ai’shah said:] I used to play with dolls, which are toys. (Narrated by Abu `Awanah and others). Abu Dawud and An-Nasa’i narrated via another chain of narratorsfrom `Aishah that she said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came from the campaign to Tabuk or Khaybar… and he quoted the Hadith about him tearing down the curtain that she had hung up over her door. She said: He lifted the edge of the curtain and saw some dolls belonging to `Aishah. He said: “What is this, O `Aishah?”\xa0 She said: My dolls. He saw among them a horse that had wings attached to it and said: “What is this?” I said: A horse. He said: “A horse with wings?” I said: Have you not heard that Sulayman had horses that had wings? And he smiled.”\xa0\nThe report mentioned by Ibn Hajar was also narrated by Abu Dawud (no. 22813) and classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Ghayat Al-Maram (129).\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: What is the ruling on buying dolls and on the images that are found in books, such as images of animals and birds, and so on, because children enjoy looking at them and they learn by looking at them, and I do not know what the ruling on that is?\nHe replied:\n“With regard to dolls for children, which are three-dimensional images in the form of a woman or a girl or a child, they may be divided into two categories:\n\nThe first category is permissible and there is nothing wrong with it. It includes the dolls that are made nowadays that have no facial features, no eyes or nose or mouth. There are no reservations about the permissibility of these, because `Ai’shah (may Allah be pleased with her) had dolls that were like this, with which she played.\nThe second category is those that are made of plastic and look exactly like human beings, with eyes, lips, eyelashes and eyebrows; some of them even walk and talk. There is some reservation about the permissibility of these, but I am not strict about it, because the Hadith of ‘Ai’shah (may Allah be pleased with her) says that she played with dolls, it may be said that it is indicative of lenience concerning dolls, especially since, as I said, children may enjoy playing with them. Nevertheless we say: so long as there is an alternative to that, we should not turn to that which is doubtful when that which is not doubtful is available, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: Leave that which makes you doubt for that which does not make you doubt.\n\nAs for images of other animals , such as horses, lions and the like, there is no justification for keeping them at all, when we have an alternative in the form of toys that are based on equipment such as cars, bulldozers and the like. A boy can play with those just as he would play with toy animals. But if a person is given one of these animals as a gift, then he should cut off its head and leave it without a head, and there is nothing wrong with that.” (Liqa’ Al-Bab Al-Maftuh, 26/6)\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/119056/is-it-permissible-to-sell-gifts-and-toys
