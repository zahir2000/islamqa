259136,"I work as an accountant in a Saudi company, but my sponsor makes me do work that has nothing to do with accountancy, and has nothing to do with my original job. He forces me to do that and does not pay me for this work. Is there any blame on me if I take payment or tips in return for this work without his knowledge?","['Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible for the boss to force the worker to do anything except what was agreed upon in the written or verbal work contract, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {O you who have believed, fulfill [all] contracts} [Al-Ma’idah 5:1].\nAnd the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The Muslims are bound by their conditions.” Narrated by Abu Dawud (3594); c lassed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud.\nThe worker may refuse to do that, or demand payment for the additional work. If the boss refuses, then the right thing to do is to quit the job, or refer the matter to the authorities.\nAs for payment, if he takes something from the wealth of the sponsor, it is not permissible to do that without his knowledge, because that is deceit and a betrayal of trust.\nIf he accepts payment from the clients of the company, as appears to be the case from the question, then that is a gift to a worker, which is also haram.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/259136/his-sponsor-is-forcing-him-to-do-work-that-has-nothing-to-do-with-his-profession-can-he-take-something-from-him-in-return-for-that-without-his-knowledge
