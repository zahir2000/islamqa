511279,"My father and I do not have a good relationship, because his wife does not like us, and he has been unfair to us in all ways. A while ago I got to know a family, all of whom follow are Sunnis, except the mother and father, who follow a different school of thought. The children are all good in terms of religious commitment and character, and one of the sons has proposed marriage to me. I had no choice but to tell my father, so that he could give me in marriage, but he refused, because the mother and father do not follow our school of thought, but the suitor does follow my school of thought. My father did not do that out of concern for me; rather he said that his reputation would become tarnished if people found out. I want to marry this man, and he is a suitable match for me, because he is religiously committed, of good character and wealthy. Is the school of thought of the mother or father of the suitor a valid reason for refusing to let their son marry me, or does my father have no right to reject him? Please note that he is a righteous man and I want to marry him.","['Praise be to Allah.If the father refuses to give his daughter in marriage to a young man who is of good character and religiously committed because his parents are not Sunnis, then his rejection is valid, and is not regarded as preventing his daughter from getting married, because marriage is a strong bond between the spouses and their families. Her father will have no choice but to interact with the father of this young man, and his parents will become grandparents to your children. The fact that the parents follow a path other than the Sunni path is most likely to bring shame on you, your family and your children, and there is the possibility of conflict and dispute in the future. So your father is not to be blamed for rejecting this marriage.\nNo matter how estranged the father is from his daughter, his paternal compassion will prompt him to make a good choice for her.\nIf we assume that his concern is for his reputation only, he has the right to be concerned and not agree to a marriage that will tarnish his reputation or undermine it. Hence Islam gives weight to the matter of compatibility between the spouses, and gives the right to all the guardians of the woman to reject a marriage to one who is not compatible, because the shame will affect all of them.\nIt says in Kashshaf al-Qina‘ (5/67):\nCompatibility is the right of the woman and of all the guardians, whether they are closely or distantly related to her, and it is even the right of guardians who may be born after the marriage contract has been done, because they will all be shamed equally if there is no compatibility.\nIf a one’s marriage is arranged to someone who is not compatible with her, then anyone who is not pleased with the marriage has the right to nullify it – including the woman and any of her guardians – who may express their disapproval immediately or later on, because the option to nullify is there due to shortcomings in the one with whom the marriage contract was done. This is akin to the option of proceeding with a sale transaction or cancelling it. The more distantly-related guardian has the right to annul the marriage with the approval of the one who is more closely related, and with the approval of the wife, so as to ward off what the more distantly-related guardian could face of shame.\nSo if the father gives his daughter in marriage to someone who is not compatible, with her consent, her brothers can nullify it – as stated – because they will all carry the burden of shame resulting from the marriage of a female relative to someone who is incompatible. End quote.\nConclusion:\nThe difference in schools of thought is clearly a shortcoming in the family of the suitor, and it may bring blame and shame on you and your family.\nOr it may not lead to that in some places and some communities. But if the father rejects the marriage for this reason, then his rejection is valid.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/511279/can-the-father-refuse-to-give-his-daughter-in-marriage-to-a-young-man-who-is-good-in-terms-of-character-and-religious-commitment-because-his-parents-are-not-sunni
508244,Is it permissible to say that the Muslims are acting in the stead of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and of the Companions in carrying the message of Islam and conveying it?,"['Praise be to Allah.Yes, it is correct to say this. The Muslims are acting in the Prophet’s stead in conveying the message of Islam, calling people to it and explaining the teachings of Islam and conveying them to people.\nThe most deserving of the Muslims to be described as acting in the Prophet’s stead are the scholars.\nThis was stated by some of the scholars, such as ash-Shatibi (may Allah have mercy on him), who said:\nThe mufti is acting in the Prophet’s stead in the Muslim community.\nThe evidence for that is found in several things:\n-1-\xa0The religious texts. In the hadith it says that the scholars are the heirs of the prophets. The prophets did not leave behind any dinars or dirhams (that is, wealth); rather they left behind knowledge. In as-Sahih it is narrated that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whilst I was sleeping, I saw a vessel that was brought to me, in which was milk. I drank from it until its moisture flowed from beneath my nails, then I gave my leftovers to ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab.” They said: How did you interpret that, O Messenger of Allah? He said: “Knowledge.”\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was sent as a warner, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “But you are only a warner” [Hud 11:12], and He says of the scholars (interpretation of the meaning): “For there should separate from every division of them a group [remaining] to obtain understanding in the religion and warn [i.e., advise] their people\xa0” [at-Tawbah 9:122].\n-2-\xa0The scholar is acting in the Prophet’s stead in conveying the rulings of Islam, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Let those of you who are present convey to those who are absent.” And he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Convey from me, even if it is one verse.” As that is the case, it means that he is acting in the Prophet’s stead.\n-3-\xa0The mufti is a lawgiver in one sense, because what he conveys of Islamic rulings is either transmitted from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) or it is derived from the religious texts that were narrated from him. In the former case, he is conveying it and in the latter case he is acting in his stead by initiating rulings, and initiating rulings is only for the lawgiver. If the mujtahid (mufti) initiates rulings based on what he thinks and works out, then in this sense he is a lawgiver and must be followed. This definitely means that the scholar is the successor of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and even in the case where he is only conveying the ruling that was given by the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), he still has to examine the matter and understand the wording of the text, and understand the reasons for the ruling and how the ruling is connected to its reason. In both cases, he is the one who must do that, so in this regard he is acting in the lawgiver’s stead in that sense. It says in the hadith: “Whoever reads the Qur’an, prophethood is placed in his heart.”\nIn conclusion, the mufti is telling people the rulings of Allah, as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did; and is approving or disapproving of the deeds of accountable people on the basis of his understanding, as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did; and his rulings are to be implemented by the Muslims, because he is the successor to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Hence the scholars are called those in authority, and obedience to them is mentioned alongside obedience to Allah and His Messenger in the verse (interpretation of the meaning): “obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you” [an-Nisa’ 4:59].\nThere is a great deal of evidence to support this concept.
