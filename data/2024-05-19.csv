486872,"What is the ruling on accepting change in a currency other than the one with which I paid when buying something? For example, I bought some batteries for $90; I give the seller $100 and he gave me back $10 in Turkish currency.","['Praise be to Allah.If you purchase something from a seller on the basis that the price is in dollars, for example, as mentioned in the question, and he owes you change, then there are two scenarios:\n-1-\nYou agree that he will give you the change in a different currency, as in your question. In this case, it is stipulated that it be done on the spot, so that you do not part before you settle what is outstanding between you [and you receive the full amount in the other currency].\nIbn al-Mundhir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: All of the scholars from whom I acquired knowledge are unanimously agreed that if the two parties who exchange currency for currency part before making the exchange, then the transaction is invalid.""(Al-Ishraf ‘ala Madhahib al-‘Ulama’\xa06/61).\nIbn ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Ahmad ibn Hanbal used to say: He may accept dinars (gold coins) for dirhams (silver coins) and dirhams for dinars, whether it is a loan or otherwise, based on the current exchange rate.""(At-Tamhid\xa0 10/52).\nAl-Khattabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is stipulated that they should not part with anything outstanding between them, because receiving payment in dirhams for a loan in dinars is an exchange, and an exchange transaction is not valid unless it is done on the spot.""(Ma‘alim as-Sunan\xa0 3/74).\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If a man agrees to give one dinar in exchange for ten dirhams, but the other man only has five dirhams with him, it is not permissible for them to part until he has received all ten dirhams. If he accepts the five and they part, the transaction is invalid for half of the dinar. But is it also invalid with regard to the five dirhams that he received? There are two scenarios, depending on how they agreed to conclude the deal.""(Al-Mughni\xa0 6/114).\n-2-\nHe does not have any change (smaller bills or coins), whether in dollars or any other currency. In that case it is permissible for you to leave what remains due to you from the hundred dollars as a trust with him, on condition that what he owes you is still ten dollars and not its equivalent in any other currency.\nThen when you come to collect it from him, you may agree that he should pay you in the same currency (dollars) or in another currency, which you agree upon at that time. In that case, the exchange rate – when he gives you what he owes you of dollars in Turkish liras or any other currency – will be the rate at the time of payment, and you should not reach an agreement on the exchange rate at the time when you entrust it to him and leave it with him, so that it does not become an exchange of one currency for another with a delay in receipt of the money, which is prohibited.\nIbn Qudamah said, completing what is mentioned above, after discussing the invalidity of the exchange between both of them:\nIf they want to settle the matter, then they should nullify the exchange deal with regard to the other half for which he does not have money to pay it, or they can annul the entire deal, then he can buy half a dinar from him for five dirhams and give that to him, and take the entire dinar. Thus what he bought from him belongs to him, and the rest is a trust under his care, then they may part. Then later on, if he wants to give him the remainder of what he owes him for the dinar, or buy something from him with what remains of it, or make it a payment for a salam transaction [paying for something in advance to be delivered later on], or give it to him, it is permissible for him to do that. The same applies if he wants to appoint him as his proxy to do something with it.\nIf he buys silver for one and a half dinars, and gives the seller two dinars and says to him: I appoint you as my proxy to dispose of the extra half dinar, that is valid.\nIf he exchanges ten dirhams for one dinar, then gives him more than a dinar, to weigh for him what he owes at some other time, that is permissible, even if a long time elapses, and the additional amount is a trust which is under his care; he is not liable if it is lost or damaged. Ahmad discussed most of these issues.\nIf one of them only has five dirhams and he buys half a dinar with it, but receives an entire dinar, and he gives him the five dirhams then borrows them back from him, and uses them to buy the other half of the dinar, or he buys the whole dinar from him for ten dirhams from the outset, and he gives him five dirhams, then he borrows them back from him and pays them to him for the other half, not by way of trickery, there is nothing wrong with that.""(Al-Mughni\xa0 6/114).\nAl-Bahuti (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If he buys silver for one and a half dinars and the purchaser gives the seller two dinars to take what he is owed from that, so the seller takes what he is owed from the two dinars, even after they part, then the exchange is valid, because it took place on the spot before parting, and what is delayed is separating what is his from what belongs to the other one. The extra amount left over from the two dinars is a trust under the seller’s care, because there is nothing to indicate that he is liable for it.\nIf he offers him five dirhams in exchange for half a dinar, then he gives him a dinar to take half from it, the exchange is valid, because the exchange has taken place on the spot, even if separating what is his from what is owed to the buyer is delayed until after they part, as half of it is for him and the rest of the dinar is a trust under his care, meaning that it is under the care of the one who took the dinar, because of what we have noted above. Thus they may part before the dinar is split. Then if the one who took the dinar completes the exchange by returning to him what he owes him of the dinar, that is permissible. Or if he purchases something from him with the rest of the dinar, that is permissible; if he makes it a payment for something to be delivered later on (salam transaction), that is permissible, because it is his money and is not a debt. Or if he gives it to him as a gift, meaning that the one who gave the dinar gives the rest of it to the one who took it, that is permissible because the owner of the dinar has disposed of what is left of it in an appropriate manner.\nEnd quote from Kashshaf al-Qina‘ (8/46). See also: Masa’il al-Imam Ahmad by Abu’l-Fadl Salih (3/234).\nBased on that, if you gave the other person $100 so that he could take $90 from it as the price for the goods and give the rest back to you in Turkish currency, there is nothing wrong with that, so long as it was done on the spot [before parting].\nIf he does not have any change, then you may leave the $10 with him as a trust, then when you want to ask him to give it back to you, he may either give you $10 or give you the equivalent in another currency.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/486872/what-is-the-ruling-on-accepting-change-in-a-different-currency-when-buying-something
100009,I have friends who stay in the masjid after Fajr prayer to mention Allah individually. Others sit in a group and recite the Quran together in the same masjid. What is your opinion about this? Is it better to read the Adhkar of day and night in the masjid or at home?,"['Praise be to Allah.Virtues of staying in the mosque after Fajr\nIt is recommended to stay in the mosque after Fajr prayer until the sun rises, because this is what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his companions did, and because there is great reward in that. Muslim (670) narrated from Jabir ibn Samurah (may Allah be pleased with him) that when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had prayed Fajr, he would sit in his prayer place until the sun had risen properly.\xa0\nMuslim also narrated (670) that Sammak ibn Harb (may Allah have mercy on him) said: I said to Jabir ibn Samurah: Did you sit with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)? He said: Yes, frequently. He would not get up from the place in which he had prayed Fajr until the sun had risen, and when the sun had risen he would get up. They used to chat and talk about matters of the Jahiliyyah (the pre-Islamic period), and they would laugh but he smiled.\xa0\nAt-Tirmidhi narrated that Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever prays Fajr in congregation then sits remembering Allah until the sun rises, then prays two rak’ahs, will have a reward like that of Hajj and ‘Umrah .” He said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “In full, in full, in full.” \xa0\nThis Hadith was classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Tirmidhi.\xa0\nThis points to the virtue of sitting in the mosque after Fajr prayer, and the virtue of praying two Rak`ahs when the sun has risen fully.\xa0\nIn general, if a person stays in the mosque to remember Allah (Dhikr) and worship Him, or waiting for the prayer, all of these are good deeds and acts of worship that bring one closer to Allah. Al-Bukhari (445) and Muslim (649) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The angels send blessings upon one of you so long as he is in his prayer-place where he offered his prayer, so long as he does not break his wudu; they say: ‘O Allah forgive him, O Allah have mercy on him.’”\xa0\nBased on this, your brothers have done well by staying in the mosque to remember Allah, and we ask Allah to reward them.\xa0\nReading Quran in unison\nReading the Quran together in unison is not prescribed, because it is not mentioned in the Sunnah. And if it is done in a loud voice that disturbs those who are remembering Allah and sitting there, then it is even more disliked, because of the general meaning of the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “When one of you stands in prayer, he is conversing with his Lord, so let one of you know what he is saying to his Lord and do not raise your voices above one another in reciting when praying.” (Narrated by Ahmad, 4928 and classed as authentic by Shu’ayb Al-Arna’ut in Tahqiq Al-Musnad).\xa0\nIt says in Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah (4/112): What is the ruling on reciting Quran together in the mosque?\xa0\nAnswer:\xa0\n“The question is somewhat vague. If what is meant is that they recite together in unison, pausing and stopping at the same time, this is not prescribed, and at the very least it is makruh, because there is no report from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) or from the Companions that they did that. But if that is done for the purpose of teaching, then we hope that there is nothing wrong with it. But if what is meant is that they gather to read Quran in order to memorize it or learn it, and one of them reads whilst the others listen, or each of them reads to himself without raising his voice or reading in unison with others, then that is prescribed, because it is proven that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No people gather in one of the houses of Allah, reciting the Book of Allah and studying it together, but sakinah (tranquility) descends upon them and the angels surround them and mercy covers them, and Allah remembers them to those who are with Him.” (Narrated by Muslim)”\xa0\nIt also says (4/39): \xa0\n|”Question:\xa0\nIs it permissible to recite Surat Ya-Sin out loud in the mosque or not?\xa0\nAnswer:\xa0\nIt is not permissible for anyone to raise his voice when reciting Qur’an in the mosque, whether it is Soorat Ya-Seen or any other surah of the Quran, whether in prayer or otherwise, because it is proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came out to the people when they were praying and reciting Quran out loud, and he said: “O people, each of you is conversing with his Lord, so do not raise your voices above one another in reciting.” And because by doing that they distract and disturb one another.”\xa0\nThese readers should be advised and called in a gentle manner.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/100009/virtues-of-staying-in-the-mosque-after-fajr
466518,"I had a question I think a lot of sisters might be wondering about, and I would like to help other sisters with the answer Aof these questions in shaa Allah. So I recently stopped using makeup as I learned that tabarrujj is a very big sin. However I wanted to ask if using eyebrow gel (that has no color, and is only used to keep eyebrows from being messy and stay in shape) is allowed to use? As well as curling ones eyelashes, as one is not applying any makeup on the eyelashes but only curling them to make them more visible? Also what’s the opinion regarding using lip oils and lip balms to keep lips from being chapped? They give no color but have some gloss, is these still considered tabarrujj? Lastly, as perfume is also tabarrujj, what can someone use as an alternative to perfume to feel more clean and feminine etc, is scented oils permissible?","['Praise be to Allah.Your question contains a number of issues:\n-1-\nEyebrow gel, which is a clear, sticky substance, is used to adjust the eyebrows and keep them in good shape. In other words, it is a kind of combing the eyebrows to make them look better.\nThe basic principle with regard to using this substance is that it is permissible, and it is regarded as a type of adornment. So for a woman who chooses to follow the juristic view that the face is not ‘awrah and may be uncovered – because the issue of a woman uncovering her face is a controversial matter, and on our website we think that it is more likely that it is obligatory to cover the face, as discussed in the answer to question no. 219722 – it is not permissible for her to apply this gel when going out, but it is permissible for her to use it in the presence of those in front of whom it is permissible for her to show her adornment.\nThe other issue here is that if this substance forms a layer over the eyebrows that prevents water from reaching them, then when doing wudu, the woman must make sure to remove it so that the water will wet her eyebrows.\nIf the condition of using this substance is that it should not be touched by water for one day, or for a longer or shorter period during which the times for prayer will come, then it is not permissible to use it in that case, if it means that the face will not be washed or that the eyes will not be washed when doing wudu because of that. Rather she may use it during her monthly period when she does not need to do wudu.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If there is some wax, dough, henna or the like on some part of the body which prevents water from reaching some spots on that limb, then the individual’s wudu is not valid, whether there is a lot of that substance or a little.\nBut if some trace or colour of henna is left on the hand, without the substance itself, or there is some trace of fluid oil, in such a way that the water can reach the skin and run over it but not remain, then his wudu is valid.""(Al-Majmu‘\xa0 1/467).\nIn al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah, it says: The Hanafis and Malikis stated that one of the conditions of wudu being valid is removing anything that prevents the water from reaching the skin because it forms a barrier, such as wax, fat, dough and mud. The Shafa‘is and Hanbalis regarded removing anything that prevents water from reaching the skin as one of the conditions of wudu.""(Al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah al-Kuwaitiyyah\xa0 43/329).\n-2-\nCurling eyelashes, which is done without adding any substance to them. This is also a kind of adornment. The basic principle is that it is permissible to do it, but for a woman who chooses to follow the juristic view that the face is not ‘awrah and may be uncovered, it is not permissible for her to do this when going out, but it is permissible for her to do it in the presence of those in front of whom it is permissible for her to show her adornment.\n-3-\nLip oils and lip balms are of many types, and most of them do not form a layer on the lips. Based on that, with regard to the ruling on wudu, they do not affect its validity.\nBut if they are the type that forms a layer on the lip and has substance, then this should be removed when doing wudu so that water will reach the skin.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If the fat does not have substance – rather a trace of it remains on the part of the body to be washed when doing wudu – then it does not matter, but in that case you should make sure to rub the limb whilst pouring water over it, because usually the fat does not dissolve in water, and perhaps water may not reach the entire limb.""(Majmu‘ Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymin\xa0 11/147).\nHowever, with regard to these things being adornment, they are of different types. If the lip balm is shiny in a manner that attracts attention like a cosmetic, then it is a type of adornment, and the basic principle is that wearing it is permissible. So for a woman who chooses to follow the juristic view that the face is not ‘awrah and may be uncovered, it is not permissible for her to apply lip balm when going out, but it is permissible for her to use it in the presence of those in front of whom it is permissible for her to show her adornment.\n-4-\nPerfumed oils and alternatives to perfume.\nThe basic principle is that in the case of perfume of which the smell is detectable by others, it is not permissible for a woman to use it when going out of the house and passing by non-mahrams. There is a stern warning concerning that. It was narrated that Abu Musa al-Ash‘ari said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Any woman who puts on perfume then passes by people so that they may smell her fragrance, is a zaniyah.” Narrated by an-Nasa’i (5126); classed as hasan by al-Albani.\nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Any woman who perfumes herself with bakhur (incense) should not attend ‘Isha’ prayer with us.” Narrated by Muslim (444).\nWith regard to perfumed oils and alternatives to perfume, there are different types available in the marketplace. The guideline on the ruling concerning them is:\nIf their fragrance is detectable by others when going out, then the ruling is as mentioned above; that is not allowed and is prohibited. But if their fragrance is not obvious to others, and they are only worn to make the body smell good and remove any bad odours from it, then there is nothing wrong with using this type when going out.\nIt was narrated from ‘Imran ibn Husayn that the Prophet of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “I do not ride on red saddle cloths and I do not wear clothes dyed with safflower or a shirt hemmed with silk.” He said: Al-Hasan pointed to the neck of his shirt. He said: And he said: “Perfume for men should have a scent and no colour, and perfume for women should have a colour and no scent.”\nNarrated by Abu Dawud (4048), at-Tirmidhi (2788) and others; classed as sahih by al-Albani.\nSa‘id ibn Abi ‘Arubah – the narrator of the hadith – said, after narrating it, as is recorded by Abu Dawud:\nI think he said: They understood his words concerning women’s perfume as applying if she goes out; if she is with her husband then she may wear whatever perfume she wants.\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The woman is enjoined to cover herself when she goes out of her house, and if perfume that has a strong fragrance were permitted, that would attract attention and cause more temptation.""(Fath al-Bari by Ibn Hajar 10/366).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/466518/what-is-the-ruling-on-eyebrow-gel-curling-eyelashes-lip-moisturiser-and-alternatives-for-perfumes
96589,How many hours is it permissible for a person to sleep?,"['Praise be to Allah.Sleep is one of the signs of Allah\xa0\nSleep is one of the signs of Allah in this universe, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And among His Signs is your sleep by night and by day, and your seeking of His Bounty. Verily, in that are indeed signs for a people who listen.”\xa0[Ar-Rum 30:23]\nIn principle, sleeping is to be at night, but sleeping during the day is also possible. Allah has created the day for work and going out seeking provision, and He has created the night for rest; so sleep takes place at night and work during the day. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And it is He Who makes the night a covering for you, and the sleep (as) a repose, and makes the day Nushur (i.e. getting up and going about here and there for daily work, after one’s sleep at night or like resurrection after one’s death)”\xa0[Al-Furqan 25:47]\xa0\n“See they not that We have made the night for them to rest therein, and the day sight-giving? Verily, in this are Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) for the people who believe”\xa0[An-Naml 27:86]\xa0\n“And We have made your sleep as a thing for rest. And We have made the night as a covering (through its darkness), And We have made the day for livelihood.”\xa0[An-Naba’ 78:9-11]\nImam Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“I.e., among the signs is that which has been created for you of sleep by night and by day, in which you get rest and stillness, and exhaustion and tiredness are taken away; and wakefulness and striving for one’s livelihood have been ordained during the day."" (Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 6/310)\xa0\nShaykh Muhammad ibn Salih Al-`Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \xa0\n“And We have made your sleep as a thing for rest” means: to put an end to tiredness, because sleep puts an end to that which comes before it of tiredness, and a person renews his energy thereby for what lies ahead. Hence you see that if a man becomes tired and sleeps, he is refreshed and his energy is renewed. This is a blessing and it is also one of the signs of Allah, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And among His Signs is your sleep by night and by day, and your seeking of His Bounty”\xa0[Ar-Rum 30:23]\n“And We have made the day for livelihood” i.e., living whereby people seek their provision according to their status and circumstances. This is the blessing of Allah upon His slaves."" (Tafsir Juz’ `Amma, p. 22, 23).\nHow many hours should we sleep according to Islam?\nThere is nothing in Shari`ah to suggest that a Muslim has to sleep at a certain time and wake up at a certain time, and Islam does not tell the Muslim to sleep a certain number of hours. That depends on people’s ages and natures, and how much rest their bodies need, and it also depends on the nature of their work. One who works at night will sleep more during the day and one who works during the day will sleep more at night. Sleep during the winter is different from sleep during the summer and so on.\xa0\nThe natural average length of sleep is between 5 and 8 hours every day. If someone sleeps less than that because he is able to put up with that, or someone sleeps more than that because his body needs that, there is nothing wrong with that. What matters is that Islam obliges the Muslim to observe the times of prayer, at which time he should be awake so that he can perform the act of worship in the proper manner and with energy. If his body needs rest and sleep, he should not resist that.\xa0\nShaykh Muhammad ibn Ahmad As-Safarini (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“It is not right to resist sleep a great deal and stay up late often. Resisting and avoiding sleep will lead to other problems such as bad moods, muddled thinking, and exhaustion that prevents one from understanding and working properly, and it can lead to many fatal illnesses. \xa0\nCreation is based on balance and whoever adheres to moderation has achieved all goodness. In Al-Adab Al-Kubra, one of the wise men said: Drowsiness takes away reason, but sleep increases it.\xa0\nSleep is one of the blessings that Allah bestows upon His slaves, hence He reminds them of it in His Book.” (Ghidha’ Al-Albab fi Sharh Manzumat Al-Adab, 2/359)\xa0\nIt should be noted that sleeping more than the body needs will make one lazy in worship and will make one slow in thinking. Hence there are some sayings of the Salaf which criticise sleeping too much.\xa0\nAl-Fudayl ibn `Iyad (may Allah have mercy on him) said: There are two qualities that harden the heart: sleeping too much and eating too much.\xa0\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“As for the five things that corrupt the heart, they are those that are referred to: mixing too much with people, wishful thinking, being attached to anything other than Allah, eating one’s fill, and sleeping. These five are the greatest corrupters of the heart."" (Madarij As-Salikin\xa0, 1/453).\nHe explained that which has to do with sleep and said:\xa0\n“The fifth corrupter is: sleeping too much, for it deadens the heart, makes the body heavy, wastes time, and generates a great deal of carelessness and laziness. Some of it is very disliked and some is harmful and brings no benefit to the body.\xa0\nThe most beneficial of sleep is that which comes when the need for it is greatest. Sleeping at the beginning of the night is better than at the end, and sleeping in the middle of the day is better than sleeping at the beginning or end of the day. The closer sleep is to either the beginning or end of the day, the less beneficial it is and the more harmful, especially sleeping at `Asr time, and sleeping at the beginning of the day, except in the case of one who has stayed up late. Among disliked kinds of sleep in their view is sleeping between Fajr prayer and sunrise, because that is a precious time. This time is of great benefit for those who are devoted to Allah; even if they had been worshipping all night, they would not allow themselves to stop at that time until the sun has risen, because it is the beginning of the day, when provision comes down and is divided, and blessings are bestowed. That is the beginning of the day and the whole day depends on what happens during that time, no one should sleep at that time unless he is compelled to.\xa0\nTo sum up, the best and most beneficial of sleep is sleep during the first half of the night, and the last sixth, which is equivalent to eight hours. This is the best sleep according to doctors. Anything more or less than that will have a proportionately detrimental effect on the body, in their view.\xa0\nAnother kind of sleep that is of no benefit is sleeping straight after sunset, until the twilight has disappeared. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) disliked that, therefore it is disliked according to Shari`ah and is naturally disliked. Just as sleeping too much leads to these problems, resisting and avoiding sleep will lead to other problems such as bad moods, muddled thinking, and exhaustion that prevents one from understanding and working properly, and it can lead to many fatal illnesses, whereby a person will not be able to think properly and will feel physically weak. Creation is based on balance and whoever adheres to moderation has achieved all goodness. \xa0\xa0And Allah is the One Whose help we seek.” (Madarij As-Salikin, 1/459, 460)\nFor more details, please refer to the following answers: 160880 , 75612 , 21388 , 36889 , 21216 , 14033 , 335223 , and 827 .\nAnd Allah is the Source of strength.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/96589/how-many-hours-should-we-sleep-according-to-islam
