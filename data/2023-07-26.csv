262066,"My father died fourteen years ago. He used to work as a teacher, and the organisation for which he worked put money for me in a bank account. When I reached the age of majority (twenty-one years), the court allowed me to take this money out of the bank. I went to the bank to take out this money, and I found that the money had almost doubled because it had been in the bank for fourteen years. Does this additional amount come under the heading of riba, and what should I do with such money?","['Praise be to Allah.I put this question to our shaykh, ‘Abd ar-Rahman al-Barrak (may Allah preserve him), and he advised:\nIf the money that the organisation put in the riba-based bank was outstanding dues owed to your father, then it is the legacy of your father, so it is not permissible for you to take this extra amount. Rather you must get rid of it by donating it to various charitable causes, unless you are in need, in which case you may take of it as much as you need.\nBut if the money was a gift from this organisation, then you may take it in full, because it did not come into your possession before that, and you did not receive it, and you will not be asked about the interest that has been added to it. Rather the sin of that is on those who put the money in the riba-based bank.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/262066/ruling-on-accepting-interest-paid-by-the-bank-on-money-that-the-bank-held-for-the-heirs-until-they-reached-the-age-of-majority
222944,"In the mosques, we see many people reading Quran with the Mushaf on their thigh or knee whilst they are sitting. Is that permissible?","['Praise be to Allah.Venerating and respecting the Book of Allah, may He be exalted, is part of faith, and subjecting it to disrespect and mishandling is undoubtedly prohibited.\nBut there is nothing wrong with the reader placing the Mushaf on his thigh or knee whilst reading, and it does not seem that there is any kind of disrespect towards the Book of Allah in doing that. Rather it may be that this is easier for some readers, and is more comfortable for them when reading, especially if they are reading for a long time.\nBut in that case he must be careful not to let the Mushaf fall onto his foot or on the ground.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIt is permissible for a person to put the Mushaf in a pocket on his chest or on his side, but if he puts it in a pocket that is on his side, he should take care when sitting, so that it will not be near his posterior, meaning that he should put it on his thigh.""(Liqa’ al-Bab al-Maftuh\xa0 168/10).\nThus the shaykh indicated that there is nothing wrong with putting the Mushaf on one’s thigh.\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) was also asked about putting the Mushaf in one’s lap when reading Quran : is that contrary to proper etiquette? He replied: No.\nFor more information, please see the answers to questions no. 95753 and 95753 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/222944/is-it-permissible-to-put-the-mushaf-on-ones-thigh-or-knee-when-reading-from-it
