13406,My relative is suffering from a sickness that keeps him confined to bed. Is it permissible for him to pray at home?,"['Praise be to Allah.Patience in the face of calamities\nWe ask Allah to bless the sick Muslims with reward and healing. Undoubtedly the one who suffers sickness and bears it with patience, Allah will expiate his sins thereby and raise him in status. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is nothing that befalls a believer, not even a thorn that pricks him, but Allah will record for him thereby one hasanah (good deed) or will remove from him one sin.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2572)\xa0\nCan you pray at home if you are sick?\nThe sick person is excused from Jumu`ah prayer and from praying in congregation . What is meant by that is the kind of sickness which means that it is too difficult for the person to go and pray in the mosque. This is based on the following evidence:\xa0\n\nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0“So keep your duty to Allah and fear Him as much as you can.” [Al-Taghabun 64:16]\nAnd He says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0 “Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope.” [Al-Baqarah 2:286]\nAnd He says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0“No blame or sin is there upon the blind, nor is there blame or sin upon the lame, nor is there blame or sin upon the sick.” [Al-Fath 48:17]\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If I command you to do a thing then do as much of it as you can.” (Agreed upon)\xa0\nAnd when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) fell sick, he did not attend prayers in congregation, even though his house was beside the mosque.\xa0\nIbn Mas’ud said: “There was a time when no one stayed away from the prayer except a hypocrite who was known for his hypocrisy or one who was sick…” (Narrated by Muslim, 654)\xa0\n\nAll of this evidence indicates that the sick person is spared the obligation to pray Jumu`ah and prayers in congregation .\xa0(See al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 4/438)\xa0\nShaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“It is obligatory for Muslim men to pray in the mosque and increase the numbers of the Muslims, and to go out to the mosques (to pray), otherwise they will be resembling the hypocrites. Ibn Mas’ud said: “There was a time when no one stayed away from the prayer except a hypocrite who was known for his hypocrisy.”\xa0\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) thought of burning down the houses of those who stayed away from the prayer.\xa0\nSo you and every Muslim who is able to must pray in the mosque; the Muslim is not allowed to pray at home unless he has a valid shar’i excuse such as sickness or fear . May Allah help us all to follow His guidance.” (Majmu’ Fatawa, vol. 12)\nFor more, please see these answers: 151992 , 147381 , and 89774\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13406/can-you-pray-at-home-if-you-are-sick
223465,"If I said to someone: I asked you by Allah not to do that, then he did it and did not care about me asking him not to do it, what is the ruling on that? And do I have to offer expiation for breaking an oath?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIf someone says to another person: I asked you by Allah not to do such and such, his words are not regarded as an oath. Based on that, he does not have to offer expiation if the other person does not respond to his request.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAs for his saying, “I asked you by Allah to do such and such,” this is a request and not an oath. In the hadith it says: “Whoever asks of you by Allah, give to him.” No expiation is required for that, if he does not respond to his request.""(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa\xa0 1/206).\nSecondly:\nThe one of whom a request is made by saying “by Allah” should respond to the one who makes the request, out of veneration and respect for Allah, may He be exalted, so long as the one who asked did not ask for something to which he has no right, or asked for something that would subject the one who was asked to harm or difficulty.\nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 153727 for the ruling on responding to one who asks by Allah.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/223465/if-he-said-to-someone-i-asked-you-by-allah-not-to-do-such-and-such-is-what-he-said-regarded-as-an-oath
