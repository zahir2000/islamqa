259574,"Allah has enabled me to fast alternate days. On Fridays, my family meets for breakfast and everyone has to attend. Because I am fasting sometimes, I do not attend, because the day on which I am fasting coincides with Friday in the first week and does not coincide with it in the second week, and so on… This upsets my mother, as she wants everyone to attend and not be absent. She says to me: Do not fast on Friday, and fast for two days after that if you want. Can I do what my mother is telling me to do, without missing out on the reward for fasting alternate days?","['Praise be to Allah.Our advice to you is to obey your mother, and do not fast on Friday when you are with your family, then you can fast for two days after that, and there is the hope that you will have the reward of observing the fast of Dawud, because when ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) became unable to fast alternate days in his old age, he began to not fast for a few days, then he would make them up by fasting the same number of days consecutively.\nAl-Bukhari narrated in his Sahih (5052) that ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) said: My father arranged my marriage to a woman from a noble family. He used to visit his daughter-in-law and ask her about her husband, and she would say: What a good man he is! He never comes to my bed, nor has he approached me since he married me. When had gone on for a long time, he mentioned that to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) who said: “Let me meet him.” Then I met him and he said: “How do you fast?” I said: [I fast] every day. He said: “How long does it take you to complete the recitation of the Qur’an?” I said: “[I complete it] every night. He said: “Fast for three days every month and complete the Qur’an once a month.” I said: I am able to do more than that. He said: “Fast for three days every week.” I said: I am able to do more than that. He said: “Do not fast for two days and fast for one day.” I said: I am able to do more than that. He said: Observe the best of fasts, the fast of Dawud, fast one day and not the next. And recite [complete the Qur’an] once in every seven nights.” Would that I had accepted the concession of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), for I have grown old and weak. He used to recite one seventh of the Qur’an to some of his family members during the day, by way of practising it during the day, so that it would be easier for him when reciting at night. And if he wanted to gain some strength, he would stop fasting for a few days and count those days, then fast the same number of days, because he did not like to give up something that he used to do during the lifetime of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nI put this question to our shaykh, ‘Abd ar-Rahman ibn Barrak, may Allah preserve him, and he said:\nThe aim was to fast half of the time, so if he did not fast, he would fast the same number of days later on.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/259574/his-mother-told-him-not-to-observe-the-fast-of-dawud-peace-be-upon-him-for-a-few-days-should-he-obey-her
26182,"One time, by mistake, I told some women in a prayer room, who wanted to pray but were waiting for some women to pray so they could pass in front of them, I told them that it was okay since it was a prayer room, and we do pass in front of others in the Masjids.","['Praise be to Allah.Consequence of speaking without knowledge\xa0\nYou should note – may Allah forgive you – that you have committed a great sin, which is attributing someting to Allah without sure knowledge. This is a sin which Allah mentioned in conjunction with Shirk (ascribing a partner or rival to Allah). Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Say (O Muhammad): (But) the things that my Lord has indeed forbidden are immoralities whether committed openly or secretly, sins (of all kinds), unrighteous oppression, joining partners (in worship) with Allah for which He has given no authority, and saying things about Allah of which you have no knowledge.” [Al-A`raf 7:33]\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever introduces a good way in Islam which is followed after he dies will have a reward like that of those who did it, without that detracting from their reward in the slightest. Whoever introduces a bad way in Islam which is followed after he dies will have a burden of sin like that of those who did it, without that detracting from their burden in the slightest.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1017, from Jarir ibn ‘Abdullah)\xa0\nSo you have to repent to Allah and seek His forgiveness for this sin. I ask Allah to bless you with sincere repentance.\xa0\nYou should also strive to correct your mistake by telling those who heard what you said before without knowledge.\xa0\nPassing in front of someone who is praying alone\nWith regard to the question that you mentioned, if someone wants to pass in front of a person who is praying , one of the following scenarios must apply:\xa0\n\nIf he passes in front of the one who is praying , i.e., in the area between the spot where he puts his forehead when he prostrates and where he stands, this is prohibited, and indeed it is a major sin.\xa0\n\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If the one who passes in front of a person who is praying knows what (a burden of sin) he bears, it would be better for him to stand for forty rather than pass in front of him.” Abu Al-Nadar – one of the narrators – said: I do not know whether he said forty days or months or years. (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 510; Muslim, 507 – from Abu Juhaym (may Allah be pleased with him)\xa0\nIn this case, it makes no difference whether the person has a Sutrah (object to serve as a screen) or not.\xa0\n\nIf he passes in the area that is beyond the place where he prostrates. Two scenarios may apply in this case:\xa0\n\n\nIf the one who is praying has set up a Sutrah . In this case, it is permissible to pass beyond the Sutrah . The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If any one of you prays, let him face towards something (a Sutrah). If he cannot find anything, then let him set up a stick. If he cannot do that, then let him draw a line, then it will not matter if anyone passes in front of him (beyond that).” (Narrated by Ahmad, 3/15; Ibn Majah, 3063; Ibn Hibban, 2361. Ibn Hajar said in Al-Buloogh, 249: The one who said that the Hadith is inauthentic is not right; rather it is sound.)\n\nTalhah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If one of you puts something in front of him that is height of the back of a saddle, then let him pray and not worry about anyone who passes beyond that.” (Narrated by Muslim, 499)\n\n\xa0If the one who is praying has not set up a Sutrah, he has no more than the space in which he prostrates. This is the most correct scholarly opinion. It is permissible for the one who wants to pass in front of him to pass beyond the spot where he prostrates. That is because the prohibition mentioned in the Hadith applies to passing in front of the one who is praying, and what is beyond the place where he prostrates is not counted as being in front of the one who is praying.\n\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said, after mentioning the differences of scholarly opinion concerning the distance within which the worshipper should stop anyone from passing in front of him:\xa0\n""The most correct opinion is that it is the distance between his feet and the place where he prostrates. That is because the one who is praying has no right to anything more than what he needs for his prayer. So he does not have the right to prevent the people from (using space) that which he does not need.” (Al-Sharh Al-Mumti’, 3/340)\xa0\nPassing in front of someone who is praying in congregation\nAll of this has to do with one who is praying alone or is leading others in prayer. If he is a member of a congregation , then the Sutrah of the Imam is the Sutrah for those who are behind him.\xa0\nAl-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: (Chapter: The Sutrah of the Imam is the Sutrah of those who are behind him).\xa0\nIbn `Abbas said: “Once I came riding a female donkey and had just attained the age of puberty. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was praying at Mina, and there was no wall in front of him. I passed in front of part of the row while they were praying. Then I let the donkey loose to graze and joined the row, and nobody objected to it.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 76; Muslim, 504)\xa0 (Al-Mughni, 2/42, 2/46)\xa0\nThe correct scholarly view is that Makkah and other places are the same because of the general meaning of the evidence. There is nothing to suggest that Makkah is not included in this general meaning. This is the view favoured by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin. (Al-Sharh Al-Mumti’, 3/342)\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/26182/passing-in-front-of-someone-who-is-praying

105471,Does hasad (destructive envy) exist in Islam or not?,"['Praise be to Allah.Meaning of hasad\nHasad (destructive envy) means wishing that a blessing that Allah has bestowed on the envied person be taken away. Allah enjoined His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to seek refuge with Him from the evil of the envier when he envies. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Say: ‘I seek refuge with (Allah), the Lord of the daybreak, ‘From the evil of what He has created, ‘And from the evil of the darkening (night) as it comes with its darkness; (or the moon as it sets or goes away), ‘And from the evil of those who practise witchcraft when they blow in the knots, ‘And from the evil of the envier when he envies.’” [al-Falaq 113]\nWhat is meant by “when he envies” is when he manifests what he feels of envy in his heart and acts on it, and his envy makes him do something bad to the one whom he envies.\xa0\nDegrees of hasad\nHasad is of varying degrees:\xa0\n\nWhen a person wants the blessing to be taken away from his Muslim brother, even if it does not come to him; rather he does not like Allah to bless anyone else and that upsets him.\xa0\nWhere he wants the blessing to be taken away from someone else because he wants it, in the hope that it will come to him.\xa0\nWhere he wishes for himself a blessing like that which someone else has, without wanting it to be taken away from the other person. This is permissible and is not called hasad rather it is called ghibtah.\xa0\n\nHow the envier harms himself\nThe envier harms himself in three ways:\xa0\n\nHe earns sin because hasad is haram.\xa0\nIt is bad etiquette before Allah, because what hasad really means is hating Allah’s blessing His slaves, and objecting to what Allah does.\xa0\nHe suffers because of too much worry and distress. \xa0\n\nAnd Allah is the Source of strength. May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and Companions.” (Standing Committee for Academic Research and Issuing Fatwas)\nFor more, please see these answers: 11359 , 20954 , and 125543 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/105471/meaning-of-hasad
