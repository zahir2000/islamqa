114272,"Is it permissible to go with my husband’s brother, his mother, his wife and his sister to visit a female relative who is sick, even if the distance is not far in the same city?","['Praise be to Allah.For moving about in the same city, there is no stipulation that one should be accompanied by a mahram; rather what is stipulated is that it should be safe and there should be no causes of temptation, and it is also stipulated that a man should not be alone with a woman who is not his mahram.\nThat “being alone” (khulwah) does not happen if there is another, trustworthy woman present.\nBased on that, there is nothing wrong with going with your husband’s brother, in the company of his mother or sister or wife, to visit your relative, even if that is in the car, because there is no being alone in that case.\nAl-Bukhari (1862) and Muslim (1341) narrated from Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “No man should be alone with a [non-mahram] woman unless she has a mahram with her.”\nAn-Nawawi said:\nThe Prophet’s words, “unless she has a mahram with her” may be understood to mean a mahram of hers, or they may be understood to mean a mahram of hers or of his. This second interpretation is what is in accordance with the basic principles set out by the jurists, so it makes no difference whether she has with her a mahram of hers, such as her son, brother, mother or sister, or it is a mahram of his, such as his sister, daughter, paternal aunt or maternal aunt. It is permissible for the man to sit with her in such cases.""(Sharh Sahih Muslim).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If there is someone who transports girls or teachers, no woman should ever travel on her own with him, because that is the khulwah (“being alone”) that is prohibited. But two women may travel with him, no problem. If someone says: Each woman will exit the bus when she reaches her house, so how can two women travel? We say: Praise be to Allah. If two women’s houses are close to one another, then let one of them come to the house of the other one, and let the two of them get into the vehicle with the driver. This applies if there is not one of the driver’s mahrams with him. If a woman who is one of his mahrams is with him, that is sufficient.""(Al-Liqa’ ash-Shahri\xa01/58).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/114272/can-she-go-with-her-husbands-brother-and-his-wife-to-visit-a-woman-who-is-sick
20958,Is it prohibited to try to prevent wind from coming out during prayer or in order to stay in Wudu before prayer?,"['Praise be to Allah.`Aishah said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “One should not pray when food is ready or when one is trying to stop oneself from doing either of the two things that break Wudu (i.e., urination and defecation).” (Narrated by Muslim, 560)\xa0\nShaykh Muhammad Al-Salih Al-‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\xa0\nIf dinner is ready and a person wants to eat, should he start with the meal even if the time for prayer is going to end?\xa0\nHe replied:\xa0\n“This is an area where the scholars differed. Some of them said that the prayer should be delayed if his mind is going to be distracted by thinking about the food and drink, etc., that are waiting, even if the time for prayer ends.\xa0\nBut the majority of scholars said that the presence of food that is ready is not an excuse for delaying the prayer, rather that applies when food is ready and the prayer is about to be offered in congregation, i.e., a man is excused from praying in congregation when there is food ready that he wants to eat. So he should eat and then go to the mosque, and if he catches up with the congregation that is fine , otherwise there is no blame on him. \xa0\nBut this should not become a habit whereby his food is only prepared at the time of prayer, because this means that he is determined not to pray in congregation. However, if this happens coincidentally, then he is excused for not praying in congregation, and he may eat until he is full, because if he eats only one or two mouthfuls he may crave even more for the food.\xa0\nThis is different from the situation of a man who is starving, when he finds prohibited food such as dead meat. Should we say that if you cannot find anything but dead meat and you fear that you may die or suffer harm, then eat from the dead meat until you are full, or should we say to eat only as much as is necessary? We tell him, eat only as much as is necessary, and if two mouthfuls are enough then do not eat a third.\xa0\nCan this ruling on dinner be applied to other things that disturb a person such as needing to urinate, defecate or pass wind ?\xa0\nThe answer is, yes, this ruling applies in these cases. In the book of Muslim, it is narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not pray when food is ready or when you are trying to stop yourself from doing either of the two things that break Wudu (i.e., urination and defecation)”\n- meaning urination or defecation, and breaking wind is akin to these two.\nThe basic principle is that everything that may distract a person, keep him from being properly focused in his prayer, or worry him, should be dealt with before he starts to pray. \xa0\nThis may be summed up by saying: The essence and spirit of prayer is the proper focus of the heart and mind, hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told us to get rid of everything that may prevent that before a person starts to pray.” (Fatawa Al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 13. question no, 588)\xa0\nThe Shaykh was also asked:\xa0\nIf a person needs to urinate but he fears that he will miss the prayer in congregation if he relieves himself, should he pray whilst he is holding it in, so as to be sure of praying with the congregation, or should he relieve himself even if that means missing the congregational prayer?\xa0\nHe replied:\xa0\n“He should relieve himself and do Wudu, even if he misses the prayer in congregation, because this is a valid excuse. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not pray when food is ready or when you are trying to stop yourself from doing either of the two things that break Wudu (i.e., urination and defecation).” (Fatawa Al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 13, question, 589)\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 11591 , 174361 , 2137 , and 26280 .\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20958/preventing-breaking-wind-to-avoid-invalidating-wudu
109200,"If a man is junub and he cut his nails or hair, is there any blame on him for that? Because if one who is junub cuts his hair or nails, all parts of his body will come back to him in the hereafter, and he will be resurrected on the Day of Resurrection with some janabah on him, commensurate with what he cut of that. Is this the case or not?","['Praise be to Allah.It is soundly narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), in the hadith of Hudhayfah (may Allah be pleased with him) and in the hadith of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that when mention was made to him of one who is junub, he said: “The believer does not become impure (najis).” In Sahih al-Hakim it adds: “whether he is alive or dead.”\nI do not know of any shar‘i evidence to suggest that it is disliked (makrooh) to remove the hair or nails of one who is junub. Rather the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to one who became Muslim: “Cast off the hair of kufr (disbelief) and get circumcised.” Thus he instructed the one who had become Muslim to do ghusl, and he did not instruct him to delay getting circumcised or removing his hair until after doing ghusl. The fact that he said this in general terms indicates that both things are permissible. Similarly, the menstruating woman is instructed to comb her hair when doing ghusl, even though some hairs may be lost as a result of combing the hair.

38079,What is the minimum distance of travelling at which fasting is excused?,"['Praise be to Allah.The majority of scholars are of the view that the distance at which a traveller may join prayers and not fast is forty-eight miles.\xa0\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Mughni:\xa0\nThe view of Abu `Abd-Allah [i.e., Imam Ahmad] is that it is not permissible to shorten the prayers for a distance of less than sixteen Farsakhs, and a Farsakh is three miles, so the distance is forty-eight miles . This was the estimation of Ibn `Abbas. He said: From `Usfan to Makkah, or from Al-Taif to Makkah, or from Jeddah to Makkah.”\xa0\nBased on this, the distance at which it is permissible to shorten prayers is the distance of two days’ travel aiming directly for that destination. This is the view of Ibn `Abbas and Ibn `Umar, and the view of Malik, Al-Layth and al-Shafi`i.\xa0\nThe equivalent in kilometres is approximately 80 km.\xa0\nShaykh Ibn Baz said in Majmu` Al-Fatawa (12/267), explaining what is meant by travelling:\xa0\n“The view of the majority of scholars is that this is equivalent to approximately eighty kilometres for one who travels by car, plane or ship. This distance is what is called travelling according to the custom of the Muslims. So if a person travels by camel, car, plane or ship, for this distance or more, he is regarded as a traveller.”\xa0\nThe Standing Committee was asked (8/90) about the distance at which a traveller may shorten his prayers, and can a taxi-driver who covers more than three hundred kilometres shorten his prayer?\xa0\nThey replied:\xa0\n“The distance at which a traveller may shorten his prayers is approximately 80 km according to the view of the majority of scholars. It is permissible for a taxi driver or anyone else to shorten his prayers, if he is going to cover the distance mentioned at the beginning of the question, or more.”\xa0\nSome scholars are of the view that travelling is not to be defined by a specific distance, rather it should be defined according to custom: whatever people customarily regard as travelling is the travelling to which the Shar`i rulings apply, such as joining and shortening prayers, and not fasting .\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam said in Al-Fatawa (24/106):\xa0\n“The evidence supports those who regard shortening prayers and not fasting as being applicable to all types of travel and do not single out one kind of travelling to the exclusion of another. This view is the correct one.”\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin was asked in Fatawa Arkan Al-Islam (p. 381) about the distance at which a traveller may shorten his prayers and whether it is permissible to join prayers without shortening them.\xa0\nHe replied:\xa0\n“The distance at which a traveller may shorten his prayers was defined by some of the scholars as being approximately eighty-three kilometres, and some defined it as being what is customarily regarded as travelling, even if the distance is not 80 km, and that what the people say is not travelling should not be regarded as such, even if it is as far as one hundred kilometres.\xa0\nThe latter view is the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him), because Allah did not state a specific distance that makes shortening prayers permissible, and neither did the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).\xa0\nAnas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) said: If the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) set out for a journey of three miles or three farsakhs, he would pray two Rak`ahs. (Narrated by Muslim, 691)\xa0\nThe view of Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah is closer to what is correct.\xa0\nThere is nothing wrong, if there is a conflict between customary views, in going by the opinion which suggests that travel should be defined in terms of distance, because this was the view of some of the Imams and scholars and Mujtahids. So there is nothing wrong with that in sha Allah. But so long as custom gives a clear definition, then referring to what is customary is the right thing to do.”\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/38079/minimum-distance-for-breaking-fast-and-shortening-prayers
