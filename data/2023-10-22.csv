224401,"I was speaking to an Israeli woman recently, and she told me that al-Masjid al-Aqsa was built on the ruins of a Jewish temple that was built by the Prophet Sulayman (peace be upon him). I said to her: Rather it was a masjid (mosque) from the first day. She laughed and said: There was no Islam at that time, so how could there be a masjid! Sulayman was a Jewish king, and his kingdom was a Jewish kingdom called Judah, and everyone who lived at that time was Jewish. Is what she said true? How did the Children of Israel go astray and change the Torah that Musa brought to them, and they persisted in their misguidance even after many prophets came to them, such as Sulayman (peace be upon him) and others? What is the true history of al-Masjid al-Aqsa? What is meant by the Kingdom of Judah and the Kingdom of Israel?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nPreviously, in the answer to question no. 230200 , we noted that the Temple was a place of worship, and that what the Jews call the Temple of Solomon is not real; rather it is a myth and one of the lies of the Jews.\nThe temple which it is proven that Sulayman (peace be upon him) built is in fact al-Masjid al-Aqsa, and he actually rebuilt it; he did not build it for the first time.\nSecondly:\nThe first masjid to be built on the face of the earth for the worship of Allah, may He be exalted, alone, is al-Masjid al-Haram, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Indeed, the first House [of worship] established for mankind was that at Makkah - blessed and a guidance for the worlds}\xa0[Al ‘Imran 3:96].\n‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “There were houses before it, but it was the first house that was built for the worship of Allah, may He be exalted.”(Tafsir Ibn Kathir 2/77).\nThen forty years after that, Ibrahim or his grandson Ya‘qub (peace be upon them both) built al-Masjid al-Aqsa.\nThe Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) told us about that, in the report narrated by al-Bukhari (3366) and Muslim (520) from Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: I said: O Messenger of Allah, which mosque on earth was built first? He said: “Al-Masjid al-Haram (in Makkah).” I said: Then which? He said: “Al-Masjid al-Aqsa (in Jerusalem).” I said: How long was there between the two? He said: “Forty years.”\nAl-‘Allamah al-Tahir ibn ‘Ashur (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhat appears to be the case is that when Ibrahim passed through the land of al-Sham (Greater Syria, including Palestine) and Allah promised him that his progeny would inherit this land, Allah showed him the place where the biggest masjid that his progeny would build would be. So he built a small masjid there, in gratitude to Allah, may He be exalted, and he built it on the rock that was allocated for the purpose of offering sacrifices. This is the rock on which Sulayman built the masjid. But as the people of that time were polytheists, that structure was neglected and disappeared, until Allah guided Sulayman to build al-Masjid al-Aqsa on it. This is knowledge that the Jewish books ignore and do not mention.""(Al-Tahrir wa’l-Tanwir\xa0 4/15).\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAccording to the People of the Book, Jacob (Ya‘qub – peace be upon him) was the one who laid the foundations of al-Masjid al-Aqsa, which is the masjid of Aelia, the masjid of Bayt al-Maqdis, may Allah honour it.\nThis is valid, and is supported by the hadith that we have quoted above.""(Al-Bidayah wa’l-Nihayah\xa0 1/375).\nIt is very clear that this masjid (al-Masjid al-Aqsa) was not built as a place of worship exclusively for the Jews; rather it was built as a masjid for the believers who affirm the oneness of Allah to worship Allah, may He be exalted, in it.\nThe believers are the followers of the prophets in all eras, and it is they who are most deserving of this masjid, until the divine message ended with our Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), the last of the prophets and messengers. So he is the most deserving of this masjid, because no person’s faith is valid or has any value, after he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was sent, unless he believes in Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) as a prophet and messenger, and follows him.\nOur Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) led all the Prophets in prayer in this masjid, on the night of the Isra’ and Mi‘raj (night journey and ascent to heaven).\nThis indicates that the role of leading mankind in the path of monotheism and the true religion was passed to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and that what is required of all people – including the followers of the earlier prophets – is to be among his followers, for he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is the most deserving of this mosque, and his followers inherited that right and it will be theirs until the onset of the Hour.\nThirdly:\nThe view that there was no masjid before Islam is undoubtedly false, because Islam (in the sense of affirming Allah’s oneness and obeying Him) is the religion of all the prophets, and the structure that is built for the purpose of prostrating to Allah, may He be exalted, in it and worshipping Him in it is a masjid. This word was known before the sending of our Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nThis blessed masjid [al-Masjid al-Aqsa] was not intended, when it was first built, to be only for the followers of the Jewish religion, and in all the texts of the Qur’an and Sunnah, it was not referred to by the word which refers to Jewish houses of worship. This word is “salawat”, which appears in the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{[They are] those who have been evicted from their homes without right - only because they say, “Our Lord is Allah.” And were it not that Allah checks the people, some by means of others, there would have been demolished monasteries, churches, synagogues [salawat], and mosques in which the name of Allah is much mentioned}\xa0[al-Hajj 22:40].\nIbn ‘Abbas, ‘Ikrimah, al-Dahhak and Qatadah said regarding the meaning of the word “salawat” here: It refers to the synagogues of the Jews.\nAl-‘Allamah al-Tahir ibn ‘Ashur (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nSalawat is the plural of salah; here it refers to the synagogues of the Jews. It is arabized from the word salutha; when it was arabized the ‘th’ was replaced with ‘t’, and it was made plural.""(Al-Tahrir wa’l-Tanwir\xa0 17/278).\nWhat the Holy Qur’an calls a masjid cannot be a Christian church or Jewish synagogue; rather it is a masjid in Islamic terminology from the earliest time, going back to the religion of Ibrahim al-Khalil (peace be upon him). When the Jews and Christians inherited it from their monotheist ancestors, it was still called a masjid, and was never regarded as a place of worship that was specifically for the worship of these two religions.\nEven during the eras of the noble prophets, Musa, Sulayman, ‘Isa and others, it was called a masjid, so the followers of these prophets have no right to change the name by which it was originally called, which is a masjid.\nHence it says in the hadith of al-Harith al-Ash‘ari from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “Yahya gathered the Children of Israel in Bayt al-Maqdis, until the masjid was full and people sat in the balconies.” Narrated by Imam Ahmad in al-Musnad (28/404); classed as sahih by the commentators.\nThere is also the hadith of ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘As, according to which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Sulayman ibn Dawud (peace be upon him) asked Allah for three things. He was granted two, and we hope that he will be granted the third. He asked Him for judgement that was in accordance with His judgement, and Allah granted him that; he asked Him for a kingdom such as would not belong to anyone after him, and He granted him that; and he asked Him that if any man went out of his house only wanting to pray in this masjid [al-Masjid al-Aqsa], that he would emerge free of sin as on the day his mother bore him. We hope that Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has granted that to him.” Narrated by Imam Ahmad in al-Musnad (11/220); classed as sahih by the commentators.\nAllah, may He be exalted, tells us about the People of the Cave (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Those who prevailed in the matter said: We will surely build a masjid over them”\xa0[al-Kahf 18:21].\nAl-Alusi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “What appears to be the case, based on the above, is that the masjid is a structure that is usually built for anyone who wants to worship Allah, may He be exalted, in it.""(Ruh al-Ma‘ani\xa0 8/225).\nThe People of the Cave – according to what was mentioned by some commentators – were Christians.\nIt says in al-Mufassal fi Tarikh al-‘Arab qabl al-Islam (11/177): “Masjid” is a word that was well known among the pre-Islamic Arabs. It refers to a house in which people prostrate, and any place of worship is a masjid. End quote.\nThis means that there is no error in calling al-Masjid al-Aqsa a masjid before the sending of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), because this is the name by which Allah calls it in the verse (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Glory be to Him Who took His slave for a journey by night from al-Masjid al-Haram to al-Masjid al-Aqsa, the environs of which We have blessed, so that We might show him some of Our signs. Verily, He is All-Hearing, All-Seeing}\xa0[al-Isra’ 17:1].\nWhen this verse was revealed, the polytheists did not find this name strange and they did not say, “We do not know what al-Masjid al-Aqsa is.” They did not reject this name, which indicates that this name was known to them.\nThus we know that al-Masjid al-Aqsa is the name which will endure until the Day of Resurrection, by Allah’s leave. At the same time, it is the historical name by which the prophets called it.\nFourthly:\nAs for saying that everyone who existed at the time of Sulayman (peace be upon him) was Jewish, this statement is no less flawed than the previous one.\nThe Jewish system of law and religion is not for all people; rather it is a system of law that is only for one group of humans, namely the descendants of Jacob (Ya‘qub – peace be upon him).\nSince the time of Ya‘qub (peace be upon him) there have always been other groups of humans, Arabs and others, and the matter continued like that at all times, at the time of Yusuf, then Musa, then Dawud, then Sulayman… then ‘Isa.\nBut at all those times, there were monotheists other than the Jews.\nAll of these matters are obvious and basic principles of the Jewish religion and system of laws, which confirm that this religion is exclusive and is not universal. This means that many of the nations and peoples around the Jews were monotheists who followed the way of Ibrahim, and Musa (peace be upon him) was not sent to them with the Jewish religion.\nBut arrogance makes people deny obvious facts and be unfair in ruling, so as to provide a cover for occupation, murder and confiscation of land, and to promote Zionist terrorist ideology in the name of religion or history.\nFifthly:\nAs for the Kingdom of Judah and Kingdom of Israel, after the death of Sulayman (peace be upon him), his children disputed and his kingdom was divided into two kingdoms, each of which was ruled by one of the sons of Sulayman.\nThe first kingdom was in the north, and it was called the Kingdom of Israel or the Kingdom of Samaria; its capital was Shechem (Nablus) and its king was Jeroboam. The Israelite tribes swore allegiance to him, except for Judah and Benjamin.\nThe second kingdom was in the south, and it was called the Kingdom of Judah; its capital was Jerusalem (al-Quds) and its king was Rehoboam. Two of the Israelite tribes swore allegiance to him, namely Judah and Benjamin.\nThe Northern Kingdom of Israel was destroyed in 721 BCE.\nIn 586 BCE, the Babylonian leader Nebuchadnezzar entered al-Quds and destroyed it, and he destroyed and burned the temple, and took thousands of Jews with him as captives to Babylon, in what is historically known as the first Babylonian captivity. Then he went back to the city and destroyed it again, in what is known as the second Babylonian captivity, which put an end to the Kingdom of Judah.\nThe Jews strove to regain their kingdom and rebuild the temple.\nIn the Encyclopaedia Britannica (1926 CE edn.) it says: “The Jews look forward to bringing the Jewish people together in Palestine, restoring the Jewish state, rebuilding the Temple and establishing the throne of David in Jerusalem once more, to be ruled by a descendant of David.” End quote.\nSixthly:\nAs for the going astray of the Jews and their distortion of the Torah, despite the coming of many prophets to them, this is something that indeed happened and cannot be hidden. They turned away from monotheism to polytheism several times after the death of Musa (peace be upon him). Allah, may He be exalted, repeatedly sent prophets to them to revive the law of the Torah and guide them back to monotheism, but – in most cases – they rejected and fought these prophets and killed some of them. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Is it that whenever there came to you a Messenger with something that was not in accordance with your desires, you became arrogant; some you disbelieved, and others you killed?}\xa0[Al-Baqarah 2:87].\nAnd they distorted their Book, adding to it and taking away from it.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/224401/al-masjid-al-aqsa-is-not-the-temple-and-was-not-built-on-its-ruins
22862,"Every so often a group of stores or newspapers etc., run competitions offering prizes in order to attract a greater number of customers. I hope that you can explain to me the ruling on taking part in these competitions, quoting whatever you can from the fatwas of well-known scholars on this subject so that I can have a good idea. May Allah reward you with good.","['Praise be to Allah.Offering prizes in order to attract a greater number of customers is a modern issue in marketing due to the competition that exists in the marketplace and the keenness of sellers to promote their products. Contemporary scholars differ with regard to this issue and there are two views, one of which is that it is not allowed at all, and the other is that it may be permissible, so long as certain conditions are met.\xa0\nAmong those who are of the view that it is not allowed and is prohibited are the scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas and Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him). There follow some of their Fatwas:\xa0\nThe Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas was asked: There are some food stores in America that, when you buy from them, give you some numbers. When you have collected a certain amount of numbers as stipulated by the store, you get a prize, namely a sum of money. Is it permissible for a Muslim to take this prize, knowing that he has not paid anything for it, and it is simply because he has bought from the store or has visited the store that he has been given these numbers through which he won that prize.\xa0\nThey replied:\xa0\n“If the matter is as described, it is not permissible for you to take this prize which is given by the store because of your buying from them or because you visited them. Your choosing these numbers which were unknown to you at the time when you chose them and became known only after you chose them is a kind of gambling, and it is known that gambling is prohibited according to the Quran and Sunnah and the consensus of the scholars.”\xa0\xa0(Fatwa no. 5847. ""(Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da`imah, 15/191)\n\xa0The Standing Committee was also asked: There are some merchants who sell a certain item for one hundred Riyals, which is sold by other for approximately twenty Riyals, with a chance to win a prize of a car or some other prize, and the people rush to buy from them because they want to win that prize. Is this permissible? Please advise us, may Allah reward you with good.\xa0\nThey replied:\xa0\n“What you have asked about is not permissible, rather it is an evil action and a kind of gambling which Allah has forbidden because it involves risks and deceit, and consuming people’s wealth unlawfully. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\xa0“O you who believe! Intoxicants, and gambling, and Al-Ansab (slaughtering for idols), and Al-Azlam (drawing lots seeking luck or to make a decision) are an abomination of Satan’s handiwork. So avoid (strictly all) that (abomination) in order that you may be successful.\n91.

Eat not up your property among yourselves unjustly”\xa0[An-Nisa’ 4:29]\nIt was narrated in an authentic Hadith that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade deceitful and ambiguous sales. May Allah help you to do all that is good and make things easy for you.”\xa0(Fatwa no. 18324.""(Fatawa Al-Lajnah, 15/195)\xa0\nThe Committee was also asked: What is the ruling on prizes that are offered by some phone companies to entice callers to call more than once?\xa0\nThey replied:\xa0\n“The prizes that are given to callers using the public phones in centres are not permissible because that involves gambling and deceiving the people and consuming their wealth unlawfully in order to promote use of the telephones and increase the company’s earnings from them, as well as the enmity that it stirs up among the owners of the centres themselves and the callers. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\xa0“O you who believe! Intoxicants, and gambling, and Al-Ansab (slaughtering for idols), and Al-Azlam (drawing lots seeking luck or to make a decision) are an abomination of Satan’s handiwork.

My question is:\xa0\n1 – What is the ruling on taking part in this draw with this ticket that is given for free, and the participant does not lose anything if he does not win?\xa0\n2 – What is the ruling on buying from that co-op with the intention of getting the ticket mentioned so that one can take part in the competition? The people here, even the educated ones, are confused about this matter. I hope that you can answer these two questions with whatever evidence is available so that the Muslims may understand this matter better on the basis of religious teaching. May Allah reward you with good.\xa0\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) replied as follows:\xa0\n“This competition is regarded as a form of gambling, which Allah has forbidden as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\xa0“O you who believe!

He said that it is permissible so long as two conditions are met. He said: \xa0\nCompanies nowadays offer prizes to those who buy from them. We say that there is nothing wrong with these so long as two conditions are met:\xa0\n\nThe price – of the goods purchased – should be their true price, i.e., the price should not be raised because of the prize. If the price is raised because of the prize then this is gambling and is not permissible.\xa0\nThe customer should not buy the product in order to win the prize. If he buys it only because he wants to win the prize, and he has no need for the product, then this is a waste of money. We have heard that some people buy a carton of milk or yoghurt which they do not need, but they hope that they will win a prize, so you see them buying it then throwing it away in the market or outside the house. This is not permissible, because it is a waste of money, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade wasting money.”\xa0(\xa0As’ilat Al-Bab Al-Maftuh, no. 1162)\xa0\n\nThis view is more correct – in sha Allah – so long as a person is certain that he is fulfilling the second condition, because he is the only one who knows what he feels in his heart; no other human being can know that.\nWe ask Allah to grant us provision that is good and permissible, and to bless us with conviction and contentment, and to keep us away from that which is haram and that which leads to it.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22862/can-one-accept-prizes-given-by-stores-in-islam
259574,"Allah has enabled me to fast alternate days. On Fridays, my family meets for breakfast and everyone has to attend. Because I am fasting sometimes, I do not attend, because the day on which I am fasting coincides with Friday in the first week and does not coincide with it in the second week, and so on… This upsets my mother, as she wants everyone to attend and not be absent. She says to me: Do not fast on Friday, and fast for two days after that if you want. Can I do what my mother is telling me to do, without missing out on the reward for fasting alternate days?","['Praise be to Allah.Our advice to you is to obey your mother, and do not fast on Friday when you are with your family, then you can fast for two days after that, and there is the hope that you will have the reward of observing the fast of Dawud, because when ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) became unable to fast alternate days in his old age, he began to not fast for a few days, then he would make them up by fasting the same number of days consecutively.\nAl-Bukhari narrated in his Sahih (5052) that ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) said: My father arranged my marriage to a woman from a noble family. He used to visit his daughter-in-law and ask her about her husband, and she would say: What a good man he is! He never comes to my bed, nor has he approached me since he married me. When had gone on for a long time, he mentioned that to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) who said: “Let me meet him.” Then I met him and he said: “How do you fast?” I said: [I fast] every day. He said: “How long does it take you to complete the recitation of the Qur’an?” I said: “[I complete it] every night. He said: “Fast for three days every month and complete the Qur’an once a month.” I said: I am able to do more than that. He said: “Fast for three days every week.” I said: I am able to do more than that. He said: “Do not fast for two days and fast for one day.” I said: I am able to do more than that. He said: Observe the best of fasts, the fast of Dawud, fast one day and not the next. And recite [complete the Qur’an] once in every seven nights.” Would that I had accepted the concession of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), for I have grown old and weak. He used to recite one seventh of the Qur’an to some of his family members during the day, by way of practising it during the day, so that it would be easier for him when reciting at night. And if he wanted to gain some strength, he would stop fasting for a few days and count those days, then fast the same number of days, because he did not like to give up something that he used to do during the lifetime of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nI put this question to our shaykh, ‘Abd ar-Rahman ibn Barrak, may Allah preserve him, and he said:\nThe aim was to fast half of the time, so if he did not fast, he would fast the same number of days later on.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/259574/his-mother-told-him-not-to-observe-the-fast-of-dawud-peace-be-upon-him-for-a-few-days-should-he-obey-her
26182,"One time, by mistake, I told some women in a prayer room, who wanted to pray but were waiting for some women to pray so they could pass in front of them, I told them that it was okay since it was a prayer room, and we do pass in front of others in the Masjids.","['Praise be to Allah.Consequence of speaking without knowledge\xa0\nYou should note – may Allah forgive you – that you have committed a great sin, which is attributing someting to Allah without sure knowledge. This is a sin which Allah mentioned in conjunction with Shirk (ascribing a partner or rival to Allah). Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Say (O Muhammad): (But) the things that my Lord has indeed forbidden are immoralities whether committed openly or secretly, sins (of all kinds), unrighteous oppression, joining partners (in worship) with Allah for which He has given no authority, and saying things about Allah of which you have no knowledge.” [Al-A`raf 7:33]\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever introduces a good way in Islam which is followed after he dies will have a reward like that of those who did it, without that detracting from their reward in the slightest. Whoever introduces a bad way in Islam which is followed after he dies will have a burden of sin like that of those who did it, without that detracting from their burden in the slightest.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1017, from Jarir ibn ‘Abdullah)\xa0\nSo you have to repent to Allah and seek His forgiveness for this sin. I ask Allah to bless you with sincere repentance.\xa0\nYou should also strive to correct your mistake by telling those who heard what you said before without knowledge.\xa0\nPassing in front of someone who is praying alone\nWith regard to the question that you mentioned, if someone wants to pass in front of a person who is praying , one of the following scenarios must apply:\xa0\n\nIf he passes in front of the one who is praying , i.e., in the area between the spot where he puts his forehead when he prostrates and where he stands, this is prohibited, and indeed it is a major sin.\xa0\n\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If the one who passes in front of a person who is praying knows what (a burden of sin) he bears, it would be better for him to stand for forty rather than pass in front of him.” Abu Al-Nadar – one of the narrators – said: I do not know whether he said forty days or months or years. (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 510; Muslim, 507 – from Abu Juhaym (may Allah be pleased with him)\xa0\nIn this case, it makes no difference whether the person has a Sutrah (object to serve as a screen) or not.\xa0\n\nIf he passes in the area that is beyond the place where he prostrates. Two scenarios may apply in this case:\xa0\n\n\nIf the one who is praying has set up a Sutrah . In this case, it is permissible to pass beyond the Sutrah . The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If any one of you prays, let him face towards something (a Sutrah). If he cannot find anything, then let him set up a stick. If he cannot do that, then let him draw a line, then it will not matter if anyone passes in front of him (beyond that).” (Narrated by Ahmad, 3/15; Ibn Majah, 3063; Ibn Hibban, 2361. Ibn Hajar said in Al-Buloogh, 249: The one who said that the Hadith is inauthentic is not right; rather it is sound.)\n\nTalhah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If one of you puts something in front of him that is height of the back of a saddle, then let him pray and not worry about anyone who passes beyond that.” (Narrated by Muslim, 499)\n\n\xa0If the one who is praying has not set up a Sutrah, he has no more than the space in which he prostrates. This is the most correct scholarly opinion. It is permissible for the one who wants to pass in front of him to pass beyond the spot where he prostrates. That is because the prohibition mentioned in the Hadith applies to passing in front of the one who is praying, and what is beyond the place where he prostrates is not counted as being in front of the one who is praying.\n\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said, after mentioning the differences of scholarly opinion concerning the distance within which the worshipper should stop anyone from passing in front of him:\xa0\n""The most correct opinion is that it is the distance between his feet and the place where he prostrates. That is because the one who is praying has no right to anything more than what he needs for his prayer. So he does not have the right to prevent the people from (using space) that which he does not need.” (Al-Sharh Al-Mumti’, 3/340)\xa0\nPassing in front of someone who is praying in congregation\nAll of this has to do with one who is praying alone or is leading others in prayer. If he is a member of a congregation , then the Sutrah of the Imam is the Sutrah for those who are behind him.\xa0\nAl-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: (Chapter: The Sutrah of the Imam is the Sutrah of those who are behind him).\xa0\nIbn `Abbas said: “Once I came riding a female donkey and had just attained the age of puberty. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was praying at Mina, and there was no wall in front of him. I passed in front of part of the row while they were praying. Then I let the donkey loose to graze and joined the row, and nobody objected to it.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 76; Muslim, 504)\xa0 (Al-Mughni, 2/42, 2/46)\xa0\nThe correct scholarly view is that Makkah and other places are the same because of the general meaning of the evidence. There is nothing to suggest that Makkah is not included in this general meaning. This is the view favoured by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin. (Al-Sharh Al-Mumti’, 3/342)\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/26182/passing-in-front-of-someone-who-is-praying
