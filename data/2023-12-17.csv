475691,"I am going to get a job, in sha Allah, for which I meet all the required conditions, but this job can only be got through having a personal connection (wasta or wasitah), and I have a personal connection. If I get this job through the help of this personal connection, will my salary be haram, noting that I meet all the conditions required for the job?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe ruling on using personal connections to get a job varies according to the qualifications of the one who is applying for the job and according to the nature of the job for which he is applying.\n1.\nIf the applicant for this job is qualified for it and deserves it, then using personal connections to get the job is permissible. In fact it comes under the heading of interceding for a good cause. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{ Whoever intercedes for a good cause will have a share in the reward, and whoever intercedes for an evil cause will have a share in the burden. And Allah is Watchful over all things}\xa0[Al-Nisa’ 4:85].\nBut if the applicant is not qualified for the job, or the one who is intervening wants to give him precedence over someone who is more qualified than him for that position, then his seeking the help of personal connections and intervention for him – by one who knows that he is not qualified – is not permissible, because it is depriving the one who is more qualified of being appointed to that job, in which case it comes under the heading of interceding in a bad cause, {and whoever intercedes for an evil cause will have a share in the burden. And Allah is Watchful over all things}.\nIn Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Da’imah, it says: If the intervention by the middleman on your behalf results in depriving someone who is more qualified and has more right to the position than you, in the sense that he has more of the knowledge that is required for that post and greater ability to cope with its responsibilities and to do the required activities proficiently, then intervening is haram, because it is wronging the one who is more deserving of it, and it is wronging the bosses by depriving them of the work and service of qualified people and is depriving those in authority of the help of such people to advance in some field of work. It is also transgressing against the community by depriving them of those who are proficient in their work and could take care of the organisation’s activities in the best manner. Moreover, in addition to that, it creates grudges and suspicion, and spreads corruption in society.\nBut if that does not lead to anyone being deprived of his rights, or some of them, then it is permissible. In fact it is encouraged according to Islamic teaching, and the one who intervenes will be rewarded for it, in sha Allah. It is proven that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Intercede, you will be rewarded and Allah will decree on the lips of His Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) whatever He wills.”""(Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Da’imah\xa025/289).\n2.\nThe ruling on using personal connections to get a job in the public sector is different to using it to get a job in the private sector. What is mentioned above about it not being allowed if the person is not qualified for the job only applies to public-sector jobs, because public-sector jobs are a right shared by all people, in which all qualified people are equal on the basis of their academic qualifications and abilities, so no one has any advantage over anyone else except on the basis of his qualifications, and those in charge must choose the most qualified applicant for the public sector, without any favouritism or bribery.\nBut when it comes to jobs in the private sector, this ruling does not apply, so it is permissible for someone to ask another person to intercede in his favour when applying for a job in the private sector, even if there is someone more qualified than him. That is on condition that the company owners are aware of the level and qualifications of the applicant, and they agree to accept him as an employee in their company, so that there will be no deceit.\nThe reason for that is that this is a private enterprise, and the owners have the right to run it in the way they want, and they are not obliged to give precedence to the most qualified and most deserving, in contrast to public-sector jobs, where it is not permissible to give precedence to an applicant who is unqualified over one who is qualified for the job.\nSecondly:\nThe ruling on whether the salary is permissible or not has nothing to do with the ruling on finding a job through personal connections (wasta). In the situation where it is haram to get a job through personal connections, this prohibition is applicable to the one who seeks the help of a middleman or the middleman himself – if he is aware of the applicant’s situation, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Whoever intercedes for a good cause will have a share in the reward, and whoever intercedes for an evil cause will have a share in the burden. And Allah is Watchful over all things}\xa0[Al-Nisa’ 4:85].\nWhat is meant by a share in the burden is a share in the burden of sin.\nWith regard to the salary, if the person is proficient in his work and does it in the manner required, then the salary is halal, but if he got the public-sector job through personal connections in the beginning, his salary is regarded as haram, because he had transgressed against the rights of someone else.\nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 60199 .\nBased on the above:\nIt is permissible for you to try to get this job through personal connections, if it is in the public sector and you are qualified to do that work. In this case, you do not have to find out how qualified other applicants are, and whether they are more highly qualified than you or not, because of the difficulty involved in that, and because if you are qualified for that position, that is sufficient grounds to make you deserve to have an equal right to that post.\nBut if the job is in the private sector, the matter is more lenient, so long as the company owners are the ones who will be employing you, because it is their wealth and they have the freedom to dispose of it, giving or withholding it according to what they think is best for their own interests.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/475691/what-is-the-ruling-on-using-a-personal-connection-wasta-to-help-find-a-job-in-the-public-or-private-sector
112902,"I worked in a  Riba-based bank for 17 years, and Allah, may He be Exalted, has helped me to keep away from Riba, and I have noticed a great change in my life. But lawful provision is very difficult to find nowadays. I have not been able to find work for 2.5 years, and I have a family of five to support.","['Praise be to Allah.Working for a company that delivers documents and parcels\nWorking for a company that transports documents and parcels is permissible in and of itself, but if the company specialises in transporting unlawful things , such as delivering documents for Riba-based banks, or transporting alcohol, movies or music, then working for it becomes unlawful in and of itself.\xa0\nIf the company mixes both lawful and unlawful matters, then the ruling depends on which forms the majority of its work. It is also necessary to avoid being involved directly in any unlawful activities.\nBased on that, you may go ahead with your application for a job in that company having to do with work in which you will be supervising and solving problems. Whatever is unlawful, do not do it, but with regard to permissible documents and parcels, you may do it.\xa0\nIf the job is based on this condition and within these limitations, it is permissible for you to work there, otherwise you will be sinning to the extent that you deal directly with unlawful activities, such as transporting and receiving alcohol, or transporting and receiving movies and music, and transporting and receiving documents having to do with Riba and insurance.\xa0\nThe same applies to anything unlawful that is sent or received by this company, where you have any role to play in sending or receiving it.\nIs transporting alcohol permissible?\nUndoubtedly transporting alcohol is one of the unlawful matters that come under the heading of cooperating in sin and transgression, and the one who does it is subject to the curse that is mentioned in the authentic Sunnah. This prohibition applies to everything that Allah, may He be Exalted, has prohibited.\nThe scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas were asked:\nThere is a man who cannot find work except in a factory that produces alcohol, or a depot where it is stored, or in a shops or stores that sell and distribute it. What is the situation of the money that he earns and spends on his dependents, who are numerous?\nThey replied:\n“It is not permissible for a Muslim to work in a factory that produces alcohol, or a depot that stores it, or in any kind of work that has to do with alcohol. The money he earns for that is unlawful, and he has to look for work in which his earnings will be lawful, and to repent to Allah, may He be Glorified, for what he has done in the past, because Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Help you one another in Al-Birr and At-Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression. And fear Allah. Verily, Allah is Severe in punishment.”\xa0[Al-Ma’idah 5:2]\nAnd because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) cursed alcohol, the one who drinks it, the one who pours it, the one who presses (the grapes, etc.), the one for whom it is pressed, the one who carries it, the one to whom it is carried, the one who sells it, the one who buys it, and the one who consumes its price. (Al-Bukhari and Muslim).”\xa0 (Shaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn Baz, Shaykh `Abd Ar-Razzaq `Afeefi, Shaykh `Abdullah ibn Ghadyan, Shaykh `Abdullah ibn Qa`ud, Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 14/114)\nServing alcohol to non-Muslims\nWith regard to this ruling, it makes no difference whether the person to whom it is delivered is a non-Muslim or a Muslim.\nThe scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas were asked:\nThere are some teachers who ask the students for some unlawful drinks. Is taking it to the teacher, who is a non-Muslim, unlawful or not?\nThey replied:\n“It is not permissible for a Muslim to offer alcohol to one who will drink it , because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) cursed the one who carries it and the one to whom it is carried, and because this comes under the heading of cooperating in sin and transgression , which Allah, may He be Exalted, forbade in the verse in which He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Help you one another in Al-Birr and At-Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression.”\xa0[Al-Ma’idah 5:2]” (Shaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn Baz, Shaykh `Abdullah ibn Ghadyan, Shaykh Salih Al-Fawzan, Shaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz Al Ash-Shaykh, Shaykh Bakr Abu Zayd, Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 22/97)\nWe advise you to look for lawful work, and to keep away from anything unlawful. We think that it will be difficult for you to avoid unlawful things in that company, and we hope that Allah, may He be Exalted, will honour you by His grace with work that is better than it. Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And whosoever fears Allah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty). And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allah, then He will suffice him. Verily, Allah will accomplish his purpose. Indeed Allah has set a measure for all things.”\xa0[At-Talaq 65:2-3]\nIt is narrated in an authentic report from our Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that he said: “Whoever gives up something for the sake of Allah, Allah will compensate him with something better than it.” (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) in Hijab Al-Mar’ah Al-Muslimah, p. 49)\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/112902/can-muslims-work-for-companies-that-deliver-documents-and-parcels
469281,"I want to ask: is it permissible to delay a fast in expiation for breaking an oath (kaffarat yamin) because of extreme heat? I only want to delay it until the heatwave is over, because I owe twelve days.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe expiation for breaking a vow (kaffarat yamin) is mentioned by Allah, may He be exalted, in the verse (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Allah will not impose blame upon you for what is meaningless in your oaths, but He will impose blame upon you for [breaking] what you intended of oaths. So its expiation is the feeding of ten needy people from the average of that which you feed your [own] families or clothing them or the freeing of a slave. But whoever cannot find [or afford it] - then a fast of three days [is required]. That is the expiation for oaths when you have sworn. But guard your oaths. Thus does Allah make clear to you His verses that you may be grateful}\xa0[Al-Ma’idah 5:89].\nSo the one who broke his oath has the choice between three things: either feeding ten poor persons, or clothing them, or freeing a slave.\nIf he is unable to do any of these three, then he moves to the option of fasting, but it is not permissible for him to move to the option of fasting if he is able to feed ten poor persons.\nFor more information on the expiation for breaking an oath (kaffarat yamin), please see the answer to question no. 45676 .\nSecondly:\nIf a Muslim breaks his vow, he must hasten to offer expiation for that immediately, and it is not permissible for him to delay it, so long as he is able to do it immediately.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Fulfilling a vow or offering expiation for breaking it, in our view, is to be done immediately.""(Al-Fatawa al-Kubra\xa05/518).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Similarly, part of guarding oaths is offering expiation after breaking an oath. That expiation is required immediately, because the basic principle is that obligatory duties are to be done immediately, and that means what is required in the case of an oath.""(Al-Qawl al-Mufid ‘ala Kitab al-Tawhid (2/456). See also: al-Sharh al-Mumti‘\xa0 15/159).\nThirdly:\nIf the Muslim is going to offer expiation for breaking his oath by fasting, and the weather is extremely hot, to the point that it makes fasting unusually difficult, then what appears to be the case is that it is permissible for him to delay fasting until the heatwave ends, so that his fast will be bearable. That is because it is permissible to delay doing obligatory duties, if there is a need or valid reason for doing so.\nThat is supported by the fact that the issue of whether expiation is to be offered immediately or that it may be done at any time is one of the issues concerning which differences of scholarly opinion are valid.\nIt says in al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (10/14): The majority of scholars are of the view that it is not permissible to delay offering expiation for breaking an oath, and that it must be offered as soon as the oath is broken, because this is what we should understand when the command is given without specifying a time. The Shafa‘is are of the view that offering expiation for breaking an oath is obligatory, but the timing for it is flexible. End quote.\nAs following the view that it must be done immediately will be extremely difficult for the accountable person, it is permissible for him to follow the view that offering expiation is flexible and may be delayed.\nMoreover, the scholars have stated that it is permissible to delay giving zakah, if there is a valid reason or need to do so, and the obligation to give zakah is more important than the obligation to offer expiation for breaking an oath, because it is one of the pillars of Islam.\nThe scholars have stated that a person may delay giving zakah if he is poor and needs to keep this money, then he may give it when his situation improves, and he may delay it in order to give it to a relative or to one who is in greater need.\nSee: al-Insaf by al-Mawardi (7/141).\nAs it is permissible to delay giving zakah because of need or because there is some purpose to be served by delaying it, the same may be said with regard to the expiation for breaking an oath, because its obligation is less important than the obligation of giving zakah.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/469281/is-it-permissible-to-delay-fasting-in-expiation-for-breaking-a-oath-until-the-heatwave-is-over
230456,"My husband died a short while ago, and I am now in the `Iddah period, adhering to what is required during this time. A few days ago I spoke to the mother of one of my friends, and she said that for them in Turkey, the matter is somewhat different with regard to the woman in `Iddah, and that the only thing she must refrain from is getting married, and nothing else; as for other matters, such as putting on perfume, adorning herself, or going out for necessary purposes, they do not see anything wrong with that. She attributed this to the Hanafi Madhhab that the people in that country follow. Is what she said correct? Is there a difference of opinion among the jurists of the four Madhhabs concerning the `Iddah of a recently-widowed woman? I would like to know these details, not only for myself, but so that I can offer advice to that woman.","['Praise be to Allah.What this woman has told you, and attributed it to the Hanafi Madhhab (school of jurisprudence) – that the recently-widowed woman only has to refrain from remarrying, and that anything other than that, such as adorning herself, is permissible for her and there is no blame on her if she does it – is not correct. The Hanafi jurists have stated that the recently-widowed woman must refrain from adorning herself.\nAs-Samarqandi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Tuhfat Al-Fuqaha’ (2/251): “Explanation of mourning: it means avoiding everything that women adorn themselves with, such as putting on perfume, wearing clothing that has been dyed with safflower or saffron, putting kohl on their eyes, using skin creams, combing their hair, wearing jewellery, dyeing their hair, and so on.”\nIn Tabyin Al-Haqa’iq Sharh Kanz Ad-Daqa’iq (3/34) by Az-Zayla`i (may Allah have mercy on him), it says:\xa0\n“The recently-widowed woman observes mourning by refraining from adornment, perfume, kohl, skin cream (unless she has a legitimate excuse to use it), henna, and clothes dyed with safflower and saffron, if she is an adult and Muslim. That is because of the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “It is not permissible for a woman who believes in Allah and the Last Day to mourn for more than three days for someone who has died, except in the case of a husband, in which case she should observe mourning for him for four months and ten days ; she should not wear kohl, or wear any dyed garment except `Asb (an unattractive Yemeni garment), or use perfume except when she purifies herself [following menses], a little Qust or Azfar [types of perfume].” \xa0(Al-Bukhari and Muslim).\xa0\nHe (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) also said: “The woman whose husband has died should not wear clothes dyed with safflower, or jewellery, or dye her hair, or use kohl.” (Narrated by Ahmad, Abu Dawud and An-Nasa’i)\nThe Hanafi jurists (may Allah have mercy on them) regard it as permissible for the recently-widowed woman to go out during the day if there is a need for her to go out , such as earning a living, seeking medical treatment, and the like, on condition that she go home at night and spend the night at home.\xa0\nIt says in Al-Bahr Ar-Ra’iq Sharh Kanz Ad-Daqa’iq wa Minhat Al-Khaliq (4/166):\xa0\n“The recently-widowed woman may go out during the day and part of the night in order to earn a living… But it is not permissible for her to go out to visit other people or for any other purpose, whether by night or by day.\nTo sum up, the only reason for which she is allowed to go out is if she has a need to in order to attend to her business or errands; once she does what she needs to, it is not permissible for her after that to spend time outside her house.”\xa0\nAl-Kasaani (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “With regard to the recently-widowed woman, she should not go out at night, but there is nothing wrong with her going out during the day to attend to her errands, such as if she needs to go out during the day to earn enough to cover her expenses, because she has no maintenance from her deceased husband; rather she is responsible for her own maintenance, so she needs to go out in order to earn that money. However, she should not go out at night, because there is no need for her to go out at night. This is in contrast to the recently-divorced woman, whose ex-husband is responsible for her maintenance, and thus she has no need to go out."" (Bada’i` As-Sana’i` fi Tartib Ash-Shara’i`, 3/205)\nWith regard to staying in the house and avoiding adornment during the `Iddah period, there is virtual consensus among the four Madhhabs.\nIn the case of the Maalikis, Ibn `Abd al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Kafi fi Fiqh Ahl Al-Madinah (2/622): “Mourning is obligatory for the one whose husband has died, until her `Iddah is complete , either in terms of the requisite number of months or when her pregnancy ends.\nMourning means avoiding everything with which women adorn themselves , such as jewellery, cosmetics, kohl, dyeing the hair, or coloured or white garments worn for the purpose of adornment. ... As for jewellery, rings and so on, it is not permissible for the woman who is in mourning to wear them. The same applies to all kinds of perfume. If she has no choice but to use kohl, she should apply it at night and remove it during the day. She should not use any kind of perfumed oils. As for things that are not used for the purpose of beautification, there is nothing wrong with the woman who is in mourning using them.”\nIn the case of the Shafa`is, Abu Ishaq Ash-Shirazi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in At-Tanbih fil Fiqh Ash-Shafa`i (1/201): “Mourning means avoiding adornment. So she (the woman who is in mourning) should not wear jewellery, put on perfume, dye her hair, style her hair, or use kohl made of antimony. If she needs to use kohl, she should apply it at night and wash it off during the day. She should not wear red or bright blue clothes. She should not go out of her house unnecessarily, and if there is a need for her to go out, it is not permissible to do that at night. It is permissible for the recently-widowed woman to go out to meet her needs during the day.”\nIn the case of the Hanbalis, Ibn Qudamah Al-Maqdisi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in `Umdat Al-Fiqh (1/107): Chapter on Mourning: “It (mourning ) is obligatory for the woman whose husband has died, and it means avoiding adornment, perfume, kohl made of antimony, and the wearing of dyed clothes for the purpose of beautification .… She should stay at night in her house in which she is obliged to observe `Iddah and where she is living, if possible.”\nFor more details, please see this category: Waiting Period of Widow or Divorcee\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/230456/rules-of-iddah-for-widows
