152888,"Is it permissible to offer the funeral prayer for the deceased individually, meaning that one person offers the funeral prayer for him, then someone else comes and offers the funeral prayer for him, and so on, or is that not permissible?","['Praise be to Allah.The Sunnah is to offer the funeral prayer for the deceased in congregation, because that is what the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his Companions did, and that is what the people continued to do. But if they offer the funeral prayer individually, that is permissible.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is permissible to offer the funeral prayer individually, but the Sunnah is to offer this prayer in congregation, because of the hadith: “There is no one who dies and three rows of Muslims offer the funeral prayer for him, but (Paradise) is his due.” There are other well-known authentic hadiths regarding that, in addition to the consensus of the Muslims. The greater the number of the congregation, the better it will be… (End quote from Sharh Al-Muhadhdhab, 5/171).\nIt says in Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah (16/18): … The Hanafis, Shafa`is and Hanbalis stated that praying in congregation is not a condition for the funeral prayer to be valid; rather it is Sunnah… (End quote)\nThe Malikis said: One of the conditions of it [the funeral prayer] being valid is that it should be offered in congregation, like Jumu`ah prayer. If the funeral prayer is offered without an imam, the prayer should be repeated, unless it is too late. (End quote).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (ma y Allah have mercy on him) favoured the view of the majority, and said in Ash-Sharh Al-Kafi:\nOffering this prayer in congregation is not one of its conditions, so if they offer the funeral prayer individually, it is valid.\nThe Companions (m ay Allah be pleased with them) offered the funeral prayer for the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) individually, because they did not want to choose an imam other than the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) at that time. So they came and offered the funeral prayer for him individually, the men first, then the women. (End quote)\nIbn ‘Abd Al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said: With regard to the people offering the funeral prayer for the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) individually, what is agreed upon by the biographers and a number of hadith scholars is that they did not differ regarding that.

384718,"There are games on the mobile phone through which you can earn money in dollars, and I play these games and transfer the money via my PayPal account. The games take some time for me to obtain money. What is the ruling on this money? Is there anything wrong with giving charity from it or buying food or anything else? Is it permissible or prohibited? Is there any verse in the Holy Quran which forbids that, or any hadith of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)?","['Praise be to Allah.The Islamic Stance on Prize Money in Competitions\nIt is not permissible to offer prizes for any kind of games or contests except in archery and racing on horses and camels, and anything that would come under the same heading as that of things that help in Jihad and supporting it.\nThe basic principle regarding that is the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “There should be no (money) prizes for competitions except in archery , camel-racing and horse-racing.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 1700 and Abu Dawud, 2574. Classed as authentic by Al-Albani.)\nSome scholars added to that anything that helps in Jihad and supports it, such as competitions in memorising the Glorious Quran and the Prophetic Sunnah, and contests involving aeroplanes, ships, boats and the like.\nAl-Khattabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nGiving prizes is not appropriate except in horse and camel races, and similar contests, and in archery contests. That is because these matters are preparation for fighting the enemy, and offering prizes for them encourages people to prepare for Jihad.\nAs for contests in matters that do not come under the heading of preparing for war or strengthening oneself for Jihad, accepting prize money for them is prohibited and is not permissible."" (Ma`alim As-Sunan, 2/255)\nThe Prohibition of Gambling in All Forms\nIf the prize money comes from both competitors then it is gambling, which is prohibited.\nIf the prize money is given by a third person, or by one of them and not the other, then it is prohibited, even if it is not called gambling .\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Rather it is gambling if it is stipulated that money be paid by one of the two parties. But if one of them is offering to give money (to his opponent) if he is defeated, and will keep it if he defeats him, then it is not gambling, but it is an agreement to a contest that does not involve fighting skills, so it is not right."" (Rawdat At-Talibin, 11/225)\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If one of the two players, or an outsider, gives the prize, it is forbidden nevertheless, except in the case of something that is beneficial such as races or archery, as it says in the Hadith: “There should be no (money) prizes for competitions except in archery, camel-racing and horse-racing ”, because spending money on things that are of no benefit in either religious or worldly terms is not allowed, even if it is not gambling."" (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 32/223)\nIs It Permissible to Earn Money from Playing Games?\nThus it is clear that it is not permissible to offer money or to acquire it through playing games on the cell phone, whether all the players or only the loser pays that money, or it comes from a third party.\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 97648 , 89746 , 2898 , 249934 , 171636 , 335520 .\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/384718/is-it-permissible-to-earn-money-from-playing-games
518455,"I market courses belonging to an educational company, without me paying any brokerage fee. The price of the course, for example, is $100, and my commission is known; it is $13 for every student I recruit for a specific period. This commission stays the same until I get ten students registering through me. After I get ten students, the commission increases to $17, even though the price of the course is still $100. The company does not use multilevel marketing (“pyramid scheme”). What is the ruling on this increase? Also, for example, if I get five students to register in one month, I will have a special prize from the company that was previously agreed upon, which is $50 that is in addition to the commission. What is the ruling on this prize or motivational gift?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThere is nothing wrong with marketing educational courses in return for a known commission, if the subject matter of the courses is permissible, because this is brokerage and a fee for something that is permissible.\nSecondly:\nFor the fee to be valid for providing a service, it must be known.\nIn Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah (15/216), it says:\nCharging a fee for providing a service, and what conditions are stipulated regarding that:\nIt must be known.\nThe Malikis, Shafa`is and Hanbalis said: In order for the service contract to be valid, it is stipulated that the fee must be wealth of a known type and amount, because if the fee is unknown, that undermines the purpose of the service contract, as hardly anyone would want to work when he does not know what he will get in return, let alone the fact that there is no reason not to know what fee is to be paid, in contrast to some tasks in which the effort required and who will do the work are both unknown\xa0 for a valid reason, in which case not knowing is forgivable.\nKnowing the fee is done by seeing it or by describing it. (End quote)\nIn Al-Ma`ayir Ash-Shar`iyyah (p. 261) it says: It is stipulated that the fee should be known and it should be of value according to Islamic teachings, and be something that can be delivered. If the fee is not known, or it is something that is not permissible according to Islamic teachings, or it cannot be delivered, then the current standard fee for such work should be given. (End quote)\nThere is nothing wrong with the fee varying according to the number of students, or according to the number who subscribe during a month, so long as it is known beforehand.\nThere is nothing wrong with what you mentioned about receiving $13 for each student, then if ten students registered through you, you will receive $17 for any other students who subscribe, because the fee is known.\nThere is also nothing wrong with agreeing that if five students register in one month, you will receive $50 in addition to the commission. All of that is permissible, because the condition is that the fee or commission should be known, and this condition is met in this case.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/518455/what-is-the-ruling-on-marketing-courses-in-return-for-commission-that-will-increase-when-the-number-of-students-increases
155691,I am a student in the faculty of sciences and I want to choose a specialty that will not conflict with Islam. What do you think of specialising in genetics? Is it permissible for me to choose this specialty?,"['Praise be to Allah.The Role of Science in Islam\nEvery branch of knowledge that people need in their religious or worldly affairs is not forbidden in and of itself with regard to studying, learning and understanding. But what is of concern is how this knowledge is used and applied.\xa0\nThere is nothing wrong with studying accountancy – for example – but the problem is with the practical application of it in the real life financial world, such as working in interest-based banks and other institutions.\xa0\nThe same may also be said concerning medicine. It is a branch of knowledge that is very important and people cannot do without it, but sometimes in real life it is used for things that are forbidden in Islam, such as cosmetic surgery for the purpose of beautification, abortions, and so on.\xa0\nIs It Permissible to Study Genetics in Islam?\nThe same may be said concerning the science of genetics, which is defined in Al-Mu`jam Al-Wasit (2/1024) as the science which examines the transmission of characteristics in living beings from one generation to another and explains the way this occurs.\xa0\nIt is an important branch of knowledge, one of the greatest benefits of which is knowledge of hereditary diseases and how to protect against them and treat them. It may also be used for beneficial purposes in plants and animals.\xa0\nBut at the same time there is room for those who are toying with what is called cloning. We have discussed a little about what is permitted and what is forbidden with regard to cloning and genetic engineering in the answers to questions no.\xa0103335 and\xa021582 .\xa0\nWhat matters then is not the theoretical study of genetics; rather it is the practical application thereof. Whatever is permissible and beneficial is encouraged by Islam, and whatever is prohibited and harmful, is forbidden by Islam.\xa0\nIslamic Guidelines on Genetic Research and Applications\nIn a conference of the Islamic Association of Medical Sciences in Kuwait, which was held under the heading, “Genetics, Genetic Engineering, the Human Genome and Gene Therapy: an Islamic View,” with the participation of the Islamic Fiqh Council in Jeddah, the Local Chapter of the World Health Organization in Alexandria, and the Islamic Organization for Education, Science and Culture, which was held during the period 23-25 Jumada Al-Akhirah 1419 AH/13-15 October 1998 CE, the following statement was issued:\xa0\nIslam is the religion of science and knowledge, as it says in the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {Say: ‘Are those who know equal to those who know not?’} [Az-Zumar 39:2]\nIslam does not hold the human mind back from beneficial scientific research, but it is not permissible for the results of this research to be put into practice until they have been measured against Islamic guidelines. Whatever is in accordance with Shari`ah is permitted, and whatever goes against it is not permitted. The science of genetics with its various aspects – as with all additions to knowledge – is something that Islam encourages and Muslim scientists should be in the forefront of it.\xa0(End quote)\xa0\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 111969 , 308325 , 119830 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/155691/is-it-permissible-to-study-genetics-in-islam
