449483,"Is it permissible to take injections for weight loss half an hour before Iftar, knowing that they are administered either in the stomach, thigh, or arm, and they release a hormone in the body that helps to increase insulin levels; to enhance the metabolic rate, assist in eating a smaller quantity of food, and to suppress appetite?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nWeight loss injections, which are one of the therapeutic techniques that help reduce weight, rely on injecting the body with the substance liraglutide, a protein similar to carbohydrates that affects neural receptors in the brain, working to suppress appetite and reduce sugar intake.\nSaxenda injections work to lower blood sugar levels by preventing the body from secreting the hormone glucagon, which affects sensory receptors in the brain, thereby reducing appetite for food and increasing the feeling of fullness. Consequently, the rate of fat burning in the body increases, and it is converted into the energy needed by the body. End quote.\nSecondly:\nThese injections are neither food nor drink, nor do they serve as a substitute for them, meaning they are not nutritious, and therefore they have no effect on fasting.\nSince they help suppress appetite, they are not considered the same as nutritious injections.\nIt is stated in ""Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da\'imah"" (10/252):\n""It is permissible for a fasting person to be treated with injections in the muscle or vein during the daytime in Ramadan.\nHowever, it is not permissible for a fasting person to take nutritional injections during the daytime in Ramadan; because it is similar to consuming food and drink, and taking such injections is considered a trick to break the fast in Ramadan. If it is possible to take injections in the muscle or vein at night, it is preferable."" End quote.\nHowever, if the injection is administered into the stomach, then it invalidates the fast even if it is not for nutrition, as previously explained in the answer to question number: (287500 ).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/449483/do-weight-loss-injections-invalidate-the-fast
114624,"I read on your website the questions and answers regarding the issue of women changing their surname upon marriage. My question is, can a husband force his wife to change her surname against her will? And what can the wife do if her husband and his family are pressuring her to change her surname in the name of legal issues?","['Praise be to Allah.Is it prohibited to take your husband’s last name?\nIt is not permissible for a woman to take her husband’s name or his family name because that is attributing oneself to someone other than one’s father , and imitating the disbelievers from whom this custom was adopted.\xa0\nAl-Bukhari (3508) and Muslim (61) narrated from Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) that he heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “Any man who knowingly attributes himself to someone other than his father is guilty of disbelief. Whoever claims to belong to a people when he has nothing to do with them, let him take his place in Hell.”\xa0\n‘When he has nothing to do with them’ means, when he has no lineage among them, as is highlighted in some reports.\xa0\nCan a husband force his wife to take his family name?\nThe husband has no right to force his wife to change her surname, and if he forces her to do it, she should not obey him, because it is obedience to a created being which involves disobedience to the Creator.\nSo she should persist in her refusal and explain to him that it is prohibited, and look for Islamically acceptable means of establishing her rights from a legal point of view. \xa0\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 6241 , 4362 , and 82138 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/114624/is-it-prohibited-to-take-your-husbands-last-name
451799,"I used mint-flavored dental floss after the pre-dawn meal, and the mint flavor remained in my mouth. I swallowed my saliva after dawn, and the mint flavor was present, so does this invalidate my fasting?","['Praise be to Allah.The basic principle concerning flavoured dental floss is that saliva dissolves it and removes it from the mouth due to its small amount and the continuous flow of saliva in the mouth, and it does not have a substance that remains in the mouth. Therefore, if a Muslim uses it before dawn, the remaining flavor does not harm him, similar to the case of strong-tasting foods, like coffee and the like, where the taste remains after brushing and rinsing. This does not affect fasting due to the difficulty of avoiding it, and what is difficult to avoid does not break the fast even if it has substance.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n""Whoever wakes up with food between his teeth is not free from two situations; one of them is that it is so little that he cannot spit it out, so he swallows it, and it does not break his fast; because it is not possible to avoid it, so it is like saliva. Ibn Al-Mundhir said: The Jurists have reached a consensus on this..."" End quote from ""Al-Mughni"" by Ibn Qudamah (4/360).\nThe Hadiths, in their generality, indicate that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) used to use the miswak while fasting, and this indicates that the remaining taste of the miswak in the mouth of the fasting person is not a problem and does not affect his fast.\nFor further benefit, please see the answer to question number: (108014 ), and number: (405051 ).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/451799/ruling-on-finding-the-taste-of-dental-floss-in-mouth-after-fajr
9843,We see some people among us in the mosque moving in the prayer in anticipation of the Imam’s movements and not after the Imam. Sometimes they move before the Imam. What is the ruling on this?,"['Praise be to Allah.It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The Imam is appointed to be followed . When he says ‘Allahu akbar’, then say ‘Allahu akbar’, do not say it until he has said it. When he bows in Ruku`, then bow in Ruku`, and do not do it until he has done it. When he says ‘Sami`a Allahu liman hamidah,’ then say, ‘Allahumma Rabbana laka al-hamd.’ When he prostrates, then prostrate, and do not do it until he has done it. If he prays standing then pray standing, and if he prays sitting, then pray sitting, all of you.” (This version was narrated by Abu Dawud; similar reports are also narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim).\n\xa0What we learn from this Hadith is that it is obligatory to follow the Imam , and that he is the leader in the movements, actions and words of the prayer. It is not permissible to differ from him. The best is for the follower’s movements to come immediately after the Imam’s movements , and not to delay them … This immediate following is indicated (in the original Arabic of the Hadith) by the particle Fa (immediately after), which implies fats sequence.\n\xa0We also learn from this Hadith that anticipating or preceding the Imam is forbidden , and if it is done deliberately, it invalidates the prayer. Delaying following him, like preceding him, is not allowed.\n\xa0The phrase “the Imam is appointed to be followed” means that the one who is following should not precede the one whom he is following or move at the same time as him; his movements should come straight after the Imam’s movements.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9843/is-it-permissible-to-precede-the-imam-in-the-prayer
