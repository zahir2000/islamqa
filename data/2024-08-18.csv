512497,What is the rule on praying in places that are higher than the Ka‘bah?,"['Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with praying in places and buildings that are higher than the Ka‘bah, such as praying on the roof of al-Masjid al-Haram, or on Jabal Abu Qubays, or on the upper floors of the high-rises surrounding al-Masjid al-Haram. The jurists refer to this matter as praying in the direction of the Ka‘bah.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nOur companion said: If someone stands on [Jabal] Abu Qubays or any of the other places that are above the level of the Ka‘bah and close to it, his prayer is valid and there is no difference of opinion concerning that, because he is regarded as facing towards the qiblah.""(Al-Majmu‘\xa0\xa03/198).\nAl-Bahuti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf he prays on a mountain that is higher than the level of the Ka‘bah, such as Abu Qubays, the prayer offered facing in its direction is valid. The same applies if he digs a hole in the ground, so that he is below the level of the Ka‘bah. The prayer offered facing in its direction is valid, because of what we have noted above, which is that what matters is the direction, not the walls.""(Kashshaf al-Qina‘\xa0 1/300).\nBased on that, there is nothing wrong with praying in places that are higher than the Ka‘bah, or in an airplane, if the worshipper is facing the direction of the Ka‘bah.\nYou should understand that the one who is close to the Ka‘bah must face it precisely, and the one who is far away from it must face in its direction, as we have explained in the answer to question no. 42574 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/512497/what-is-the-rule-on-praying-in-places-that-are-higher-than-the-kabah
70363,"I have a cousin (the daughter of my maternal aunt) who died, and it seems most likely that she committed suicide. What is the ruling on one who commits suicide? What is his position before his Lord? What can her parents do to reduce her punishment?","['Praise be to Allah.The Seriousness of Suicide in Islam\nSuicide is a major sin in Islam . The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stated that the one who commits suicide will be punished with something like that with which he killed himself.\xa0\nAbu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever throws himself down from a mountain and kills himself will be in the Fire of Hell, throwing himself down therein for ever and ever. Whoever takes poison and kills himself, his poison will be in his hand and he will be sipping it in the Fire of Hell for ever and ever. Whoever kills himself with a piece of iron, that piece of iron will be in his hand and he will be stabbing himself in the stomach with it in the Fire of Hell, forever and ever.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 5442; Muslim, 109)\xa0\nIt was narrated from Thabit ibn Ad-Dahhak (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever kills himself with something in this world will be punished with it on the Day of Resurrection.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 5700 and Muslim, 110)\xa0\nIt was narrated that Jundub ibn `Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Among those who came before you there was a man who was wounded and he panicked, so he took a knife and cut his hand with it, and the blood did not stop flowing until he died. Allah said: ‘My slave hastened to bring about his demise; I have forbidden Paradise to him.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 3276; Muslim, 113.)\nCan you offer Janazah prayer for one who commits suicide?\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) refrained from offering the funeral prayer for one who had committed suicide , as a punishment to him and so as to deter others from doing what he had done. But he gave the people permission to offer the funeral prayer for him, so it is Sunnah for the people of knowledge and virtue not to offer the funeral prayer for one who has committed suicide , following the example of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).\xa0\nIt was narrated that Jabir ibn Samurah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: A man who had killed himself with a broad arrow-head was brought to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and he did not offer the funeral prayer for him. (Narrated by Muslim, 978)\xa0\nThis Hadith is evidence for those who say that the funeral prayer should not be offered for one who killed himself because of his sin. This is the view of `Umar ibn `Abd Al-`Aziz and Al-Awza`i. But Al-Hasan, An-Nakha`i, Qatadah, Malik, Abu Hanifah, Ash-Shafi`i and the majority of scholars said that the funeral prayer should be offered for him. They responded to this Hadith by pointing out that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not offer the funeral prayer for him himself so as to deter the people from doing something similar, but the Companions offered the funeral prayer for him.\xa0 (Sharh Muslim, 7/47)\nIs suicide Kufr (disbelief)?\nThis does not mean – if it is proven that your cousin did commit suicide – that you should not pray for mercy and forgiveness for her, rather you must do that because she needs that. Suicide is not Kufr that puts a person beyond the pale of Islam as some people think, rather it is a major sin that is subject to the will of Allah on the Day of Resurrection: if He wills, He will forgive it, and if He wills He will punish for it. So do not neglect to make Du`a for her and be sincere in doing so; perhaps that may be the means of Allah forgiving her. \xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/70363/suicide-in-islam
220253,"Someone was praying, and in the last verse of the rak‘ah there was a prostration of recitation. What should he do when standing up from prostrating? Should he bow immediately with the same takbir, or should he say takbir again, raising his hands, then lower his hands, then raise them again and say takbir for bowing?","['Praise be to Allah.The prostration of recitation in the prayer is like any other prostration in the prayer. The worshipper should say takbir when he prostrates for recitation and when he rises from it, without raising his hands in either case.\nWhen he comes back from the prostration of recitation and stands up straight again, as he was doing when he recited, and he wants to bow, then he should say takbir again for bowing, raising his hands, then bow. That is because Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to raise his hands level with his shoulders when he started to pray and when he said takbir for bowing, and when he raised his head from bowing, he raised his hands again.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (735) and Muslim (390).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe prostration of recitation in the prayer is like any other prostration in the prayer. In other words, he should say takbir when he prostrates and when he rises, and it makes no difference whether the prostration comes in the last verse that he recites, or in the middle of his recitation. He should say takbir when he prostrates and say takbir when he rises, then he should say takbir for bowing when he bows. It does not matter if the two takbirs come straight after one another, because the reasons for them are different. Regarding what some people do when they recite a verse that requires a prostration during the prayer, so they prostrate and say takbir when going down into prostration but not when rising from it, I do not know of any basis for that. The difference of scholarly opinion about saying takbir when rising from the prostration of recitation has to do with prostration outside of prayer. But if the prostration of recitation comes in the prayer, then it comes under the same ruling as any other prostration in the prayer. Therefore he should say takbir when going down into prostration and say takbir when rising from prostration.""(Majmu‘ Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymin 14/315).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/220253/when-the-worshipper-stands-up-after-the-prostration-of-recitation-he-should-say-takbeer-for-bowing-raising-his-hands
171060,"What is the ruling on someone who offers a prayer and recites Surat An-Nas (no. 114) in the first Rak`ah, then in the second Rak`ah he recites Surat Ad-Duha (no. 93)?","['Praise be to Allah.Is it Sunnah to recite in accordance with the sequence of Surahs in the Quran?\xa0\nThe Sunnah is for the worshipper to recite in accordance with the sequence of Surahs in the Quran , but if he does not follow that sequence, there is no blame on him and his prayer is still valid, although what he has done is contrary to what is best.\xa0\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Our companions said: The Sunnah is to recite in accordance with the sequence of Surahs in the Quran , one after another. So if he recites a Surah in the first Rak`ah, he should recite in the second Rak`ah the Surah that comes immediately after it. Al-Mutawalli said: Even if he recites “Qul A`udhu\xa0\xa0bi Rabb in-Nas” (i.e., Surat an-Nas, the last Surah in the Quran) in the first Rak`ah, in the second Rak`ah he should recite the opening verses of Al-Baqarah. If he recites a Surah then in the second Rak`ah he recites the Surah that precedes it, this is contrary to what is best, but there is no blame on him. And Allah knows best.” (Sharh Al-Muhadhdhab, 3/348)\xa0\nCan you recite a longer surah in the second Rak`ah?\nThe Sunnah is for the imam or the person who is praying on his own to recite in the first Rak`ah a Surah that is longer than what he recites in the second Rak`ah, because of the report narrated by Abu Qatadah (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to recite in the first two Rak`ahs of Dhuhr, Al-Fatihah and two Surahs, and in the last two Rak`ahs he recited Al-Fatihah (only), and he would make the first Rak`ah lengthy but the second not as long. And he did likewise in `Asr and Fajr. (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 734 and Muslim, 685)\xa0\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“It is recommended to make the first Rak`ah lengthy in all prayers, so that the one who wants to join the prayer may (have time) to do so… because of the Hadith of Abu Qatadah (may Allah be pleased with him).\xa0Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) said, concerning the imam who makes the second Rak`ah longer than the first: He should be told to go and learn. He also said, concerning the imam who makes the first Rak`ah short and the second long: This is not appropriate; he should be told to follow the Sunnah.” (Al-Mughni, 1/334)\nThe scholars of the Standing Committee (6389) were asked:\xa0\nIs it permissible when reciting during the prayer to make the first recitation a short Surah or a lengthy Surah? Many people recite a short Surah in the first Rak`ah and a longer one in the second.\xa0\nThey replied:\xa0\n“The Sunnah is to recite in the first Rak`ah after Al-Fatihah a longer Surah than in the second Rak`ah, because of the report narrated by Abu Qatadah (may Allah be pleased with him) … And they quoted the Hadith referred to above. But if he makes them of equal length or he recites a longer Surah in the second Rak`ah, there is nothing wrong with that, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did that sometimes, as it is proven that he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to recite in Jumu`ah prayer Al-A`la (no. 87) and Al-Ghashiyah (no. 88), and Al-Ghashiyah is slightly longer.” (Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah lil-Buhuth Al-`Ilmiyyah wal-Ifta’, Shaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn `Abdullah ibn Baz, Shaykh `Abd Ar-Razzaq `Afifi, Shaykh `Abdullah ibn Ghadyan, Shaykh `Abdullah ibn Qa`ud)\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: What is the ruling if the imam recites in the first Rak`ah of the prayer, for example, Surat Al-Ikhlas (no. 112) then in the second Rak`ah he recites Ad-Duha (no. 93)?\xa0\nHe replied:\xa0\n“There is nothing wrong with the Imam reciting in the first Rak`ah less than he recites in the second, because of the general meaning of the words of Allah, may He be Glorified:\n“So recite as much of the Quran as may be easy (for you)” [Al-Muzzammil 73:20].\nAnd the general meaning of the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to the one who prayed badly: “When you get up to pray, do Wudu’ properly, then turn to face the Qiblah, say Takbir, then recite as much as you are able to of Quran.” According to another version: “Then recite Al-Fatihah and whatever Allah wills…”\xa0\nBut by doing so, he has omitted to do what is preferable, because the confirmed Sunnah, from the words and deeds of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) indicates that the Sunnah, both for the imam and one who is praying on his own, is to recite a longer portion in the first Rak`ah than in the second, in all five prayers. As for one who is praying behind an imam, he should follow his imam.” (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 11/83)\xa0\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 20043 , 6422 , and 97484 .\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/171060/can-you-recite-a-longer-surah-in-the-second-rakah
