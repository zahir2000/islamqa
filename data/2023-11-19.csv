474798,"I know a man, a relative of mine, who works for apps, delivering orders; he is the one who delivers orders to people, such as food and other things. But some companies stipulate conditions, one of which is that the car should not be of lower quality than a certain model, or it should be of certain types. This relative goes against these two conditions, and he has not changed until now. I advised him that this is going against the conditions, and that is not permissible, and I said: your wealth that you earn from this work may be haram. But he was not convinced, and he says: The car is very good, and there is nothing wrong with it, and I am not doing anything wrong. I want a fatwa about what he is doing, and which explains how to get rid of this wealth if it is haram. Is what he is doing not permissible? And is that money haram?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIf the company stipulated that in order to work for them, the representative should have a car of a certain make and model, and he accepted that, then he must meet that condition, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {O you who have believed, fulfill [all] contracts} [al-Ma’idah 5:1]. And the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The Muslims are bound by their conditions.” Narrated by Abu Dawud (3594); classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud.\nAl-Bayhaqi (14826) narrated that ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Rights are defined by stipulated conditions. Classed as sahih by al-Albani in al-Irwa’ (6/303).\nIn other words, the rights of each party to a contract are to be determined according to the conditions that they both stipulated. So the one who stipulates a condition for himself is bound by that condition, so he is obliged to fulfil what he stipulated.""(Mawsu‘ah al-Qawa‘id al-Fiqhiyyah by Dr. Muhammad Sidqi Al Burno\xa0 10/809).\nGoing against those conditions is lying and cheating, both of which are haram. So if he claims that he is complying with the conditions when in fact he is not doing so, then he is a liar, and if he had the stipulated kind of car, then he replaced it with another car without the knowledge of the company, then he is cheating.\nIt was narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “And beware of lying, for lying leads to wickedness and wickedness leads to Hell. A man may continue to tell lies and endeavour to tell lies, until he is recorded with Allah as a liar.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (5743) and Muslim (2607).\nMuslim (102) narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever deceives is not of me.”\nAnd he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Scheming and deceiving lead to the Fire.” Narrated by al-Bayhaqi in Shu‘ab al-Iman; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami‘.\nSecondly:\nThe money that he earns is permissible for him, because it is in return for his efforts at work, although he has incurred sin by lying and cheating, and he must repent from that, by stopping work until he acquires a car that meets the conditions, or he informs the company about the car that he is using at present.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/474798/going-against-the-delivery-companys-stipulations-with-regard-to-the-make-and-model-of-the-car
148062,I have an injury on my toe; can I put a bandage on it? What should I do in Wudu? Is it permissible for me to wipe over the socks in this case?,"['Praise be to Allah.How to make Wudu when injured\nWhat is required is to wash the parts of the body that Allah has enjoined washing in Wudu and to wash each part thoroughly so that there is no part of it that the water had not reached.\xa0\nIf there is an injury in the part that one is enjoined to wash, and there is the fear that it will be harmed or healing may be delayed by washing it, then he may wipe over it with water if it is uncovered and he is able to wipe over it. If it is uncovered but he is not able to wipe over it, then he should wash whatever he can of the parts of his body and do Tayammum instead for the parts that he cannot wash or wipe over.\xa0\nIf a bandage, plaster or medicine has been put on it that prevents water reaching it, he should wipe over the bandage or plaster.\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“If there is a wound on a part of the body that is washed when (ritually) purifying oneself, there are several scenarios:\xa0\n\nIt is not covered and will not be harmed by washing. In this case he has to wash it if it is in a spot that is to be washed.\nIt is not covered but will be harmed by washing but not by wiping. In this case he has to wipe it instead of washing it.\nIt is not covered but will be harmed by both washing and wiping. In this case he should do Tayammum for it.\nIt is covered with a band-aid or the like that is needed. In this case he should wipe over that covering and that will suffice in place of washing that part, and he does not have to do Tayammum.” (Majmu` Fatawa wa Rasa’il Ibn `Uthaymin, 11/121. See also Al-Mughni by Ibn Qudamah, 1/172-173; Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah, 14/273)\n\nBased on the above,\xa0if your toe will not be harmed by water, then it must be washed. If it will be harmed by washing but will not be harmed by wiping, then it must be wiped. If it will be harmed by washing and wiping, and has been covered with a dressing, it is sufficient for you to wipe over the dressing .\xa0\nWiping over socks\nWith regard to wiping over the socks, if you had previously washed your entire feet or washed whatever you were able to and wiped over the injured part , as described above, then put on the socks when you were in a state of purity, it is permissible for you to wipe over them for a period of one day and one night, if you are not travelling, and for three days and three nights if you are travelling.\xa0\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“If he put on the Khuff (leather socks) when in a state of purity in which he did Wudu and wiped over the dressing, then it is permissible to wipe over the ،huff."" (Al-Mughni, 1/176-177 )\nIbn Muflih (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“If he put on ،huff in a state of purity in which he wiped over the plaster, he may wipe over the ،huff.""(Al-Furu`, 1/198 )\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/148062/how-to-make-wudu-when-injured
158939,"In order to attain the qirat of reward, is it stipulated that one should walk with the bier from the house of the deceased to the prayer place, then offer the funeral prayer…?","['Praise be to Allah.What appears to be the case is that the one who offers the funeral prayer, even if he did not come out with the bier from the house of the deceased, will have a qirat of reward, because of the report narrated by Muslim in his Sahih (945) from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), who said: “Whoever offers the funeral prayer and does not follow (the bier) will have one qirat, and whoever follows it will have two qirats.” It was said: What are the two qirats? He said: “The smaller of them is like Uhud.”\nAnd it was narrated from Thawban, the freed slave of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever offers the funeral prayer will have one qirat, and if he attends the burial he will have two qirat, each qirat like Uhud.” Narrated by Muslim (946).\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Following the bier is of three types:\n\nOffering the funeral prayer, then leaving.\nFollowing the bier to the grave, then remaining there until the deceased is buried.\nRemaining for a while after the burial and praying for forgiveness for the deceased.""(Al-Mughni\xa0 2/174).\n\nAl-Bahuti (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Ahmad was asked about someone who comes to the prayer place where funeral prayers are offered, and offers the funeral prayer with those who come. He said: There is nothing wrong with that… It says in al-Furu‘: It is as if he thought that if he followed the bier from the house of the deceased, that would have been better. It says in the hadith of Yahya ibn Ja‘dah: “And follow it from the house of the deceased,” meaning whoever offers the funeral prayer after following the bier from the house of the deceased will have one qirat.""(Daqa’iq Uli’l-Nuha\xa0 1/367).\nAl-Hafiz said in al-Fath: What this implies is that the qirat is only for the one who attends from the beginning until the end of the prayer. This was stated clearly by al-Muhibb al-Tabari and others. What appears to me to be the case is that the qirat may also be attained by one who attends the prayer only, because everything that comes before the prayer is a means that leads to it, but the qirat earned by the one who offers the prayer only will be less than the qirat of the one who walks with the bier, for example, and offers the prayer. The report narrated by Muslim via Abu Salih from Abu Hurayrah, which says “The smaller of them is like Uhud” indicates that the qirats vary. It also says in the report of Abu Salih that is narrated by Muslim: “The one who offers the funeral prayer but does not follow (the bier) will have one qirat.” According to the report narrated by Nafi ibn Jubayr from Abu Hurayrah, which is narrated by Ahmad: “Whoever offers the prayer but does not follow (the bier) will have one qirat.” This indicates that offering the prayer earns the qirat, even if one does not follow (the bier). It may be that what is meant by following (the bier) refers to what comes after the prayer.""(Fath al-Bari\xa0 3/197).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/158939/the-one-who-offers-the-funeral-prayer-will-have-a-qirat-of-reward-even-if-he-does-not-come-out-with-the-bier-from-the-house-of-the-deceased
103880,"Is it permissible to fill in soil directly onto the face of the deceased who is buried in the Shaqq? What is the correct way of doing this (i.e., burying the deceased in the Shaqq) if we are forced to adopt this method of burial?","['Praise be to Allah.What is a Shaqq?\nThe Shaqq refers to a trench that is dug in the middle of the grave to suit the size of the deceased, and its sides are built with bricks so that it will not collapse on the deceased, and the deceased is placed in it on his right side facing the Qiblah, then this trench is covered with stones or the like and the ceiling is raised a little so that it will not touch the deceased, then the soil is filled in.\xa0\nWhat is a Lahd?\nThe Lahd (niche) refers to a place that is dug at the bottom of one of the sides of the grave in the side that is closest to the Qiblah, in which the deceased is placed on his right side facing the Qiblah, then this hole is filled in with bricks behind the deceased, then the dirt is filled in. (See: Ahkam Al-Maqabir fil Shari`ah Al-Islamiyyah, p. 30, by Dr. `Abdullah As-Suhaybani)\xa0\nBoth the Lahd and the Shaqq are permissible according to scholarly consensus, but the Lahd is preferable, because this is what was done with the grave of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).\xa0\nMuslim (966) narrated that Sa`d ibn Abu Waqqas (may Allah be pleased with him) said, during the illness of which he died: Make a Lahd (niche) for me, and set up bricks behind me, as was done for the Messenger of Allah.\xa0\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Mughni (2/188):\xa0\n“The Sunnah is to make a Lahd in the grave, as was done with the grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).”\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Majmu` (2/252):\xa0\n“The scholars unanimously agreed that burial in the Lahd and burial in the Shaqq are both permissible , but if the ground is stable and the soil will not collapse then the Lahd is preferable, but if it is unstable and will collapse, then the Shaqq is preferable.”\nIbn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti` (5/360):\xa0\n“But if there is a need for the Shaqq, then there is nothing wrong with it. The Shaqq may be needed if the ground is sandy and it is not possible to dig a Lahd, because when a Lahd is made in sand it will collapse. So a grave hole should be dug and a trench should be dug in the middle of it, and the bricks should be placed over both sides of the hole in which the deceased is placed, so that the sand will not collapse, then the deceased should be placed between these two bricks.”\nShould soil be filled in directly on the face or body of the deceased?\nThe soil should not be filled directly on the face or body of the deceased, whether the grave is a Lahd or a Shaqq, because in the Lahd the deceased is placed in the niche which is dug in the wall of the grave, and the soil is not filled in above him. In the Shaqq, the soil is filled above the roof of the Shaqq, and not directly on top of the deceased.\xa0\nFor more details, please see the following\xa0 answers: 47902 , 12386 , and 82 .\xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/103880/types-of-graves-in-islam
