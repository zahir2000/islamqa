140840,"I want to know how sound the hadith “Choose strangers for marriage” is, which is widely circulated among people. Is marrying relatives not encouraged in Islamic teachings?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIn some hadiths it is encouraged to seek strangers or non-relatives for marriage, but none of these hadiths have been proven to be soundly narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nAl-Hafiz Ibn al-Mulaqqan (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nI have not seen anything regarding this topic in any book of hadith that could be reliable.""(Al-Badr al-Munir\xa0 7/500).\nThere follow some of the hadiths that have been narrated concerning that:\n\n“Choose strangers for marriage”\n\nShaykh al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about that and he said: It is da‘if (weak).\nHe was asked: Have any sahih (sound) hadiths been narrated which encourage marrying non-relatives?\nThe shaykh replied, No. ""(Silsilat al-Huda wa’n-Nur (tape no. 594, 0.53).\n\n“Do not marry close relatives, for the child will be born unhealthy.”\n\nAl-Hafiz Abu ‘Amr Ibn as-Salaah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nI have not found any reliable source for it. End quote.\nIt was narrated by al-Haafiz Ibn al-Mulaqqan in al-Badr al-Munir (7/499).\nAs-Subki mentioned it in Tabaqat ash-Shafa‘iyyah (6/154) among the hadiths that were quoted by Abu Hamid al-Ghazali in Ihya’ ‘Ulum ad-Din for which he found no isnads.\nShaykh al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIt has no basis and cannot be attributed to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). It is well known nowadays among those who pretend to be knowledgeable, and some doctors, who do not fear Allah when teaching their students, so they teach them views and ideas that have no proof or evidence. There are some hadiths that do not have a leg to stand on, and have no basis in the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), such as this hadith. I have been asked about it many times by some of their students.""(As-Silsilah ad-Da‘ifah\xa0 5365).\nSome scholars stated that it is recommended to marry a woman who is not a relative.\nAl-Ghazali (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nShe should not be a close relative, because that reduces desire… End quote from Ihya’ ‘Ulum ad-Din (2/41).\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nYou should choose a woman who is not a relative, for her children will be more intelligent. Hence it was said: Marry non-relatives so that you will not have weak children. One of them said: The children of non-relatives are more intelligent, and the children of cousins are more resilient. Moreover, there is no guarantee that enmity will not develop in the marriage, which could end in divorce, and if the wife is a relative, that may lead to severing ties of kinship, which we are enjoined to uphold.""(Al-Mughni\xa0\xa07/83).\nBut this ruling is not agreed upon among the jurists. Some of them rejected this idea, quoting as evidence the fact that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) gave his daughter Fatimah in marriage to her paternal cousin ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib, and he gave his daughter Zaynab in marriage to her maternal cousin Abu’l-‘As ibn ar-Rabi‘, and so on.\nAs-Subki (may Allah have mercy on him) said, commenting on the view that it is recommended to marry non-relatives:\nThis ruling cannot be sound, because there is no evidence to support it. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) gave his daughter Fatimah in marriage to ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with them both), and she was his close relative.""(Quoted from Mughni al-Muhtaj by ash-Sharbini 4/206).\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\nI read something that said, “Marry non-relatives lest you have unhealthy children.” Is it a sahih hadith? Are there any other hadiths about this topic? We hope that you can explain what is the sound Sunnah with regard to the issue of choosing a wife.\nHe replied:\nThis has no basis; rather it is better to marry relatives, as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) gave his daughters in marriage to some of his relatives. As for the view of some jurists, there is no basis for it; rather it is optional. If a man wants to marry relatives such as his paternal cousin or maternal cousin, or if he wants to marry a non-relative, there is nothing wrong with that.\nAs for the view of those who say that marriage to a non-relative will produce more intelligent children and is better, there is no basis for that and no evidence to support it. If there is a relative who is good, it is more appropriate to marry her, and marriage to her may be regarded as upholding ties of kinship. But if there is a non-relative who is better-looking and better in character, then marrying a non-relative is better.\nThe point is that the man should seek a righteous wife, whether she is a relative or not, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Women may be married for four things: their wealth, their lineage, their beauty and their religious commitment. Choose the one who is religiously-committed, may your hands be rubbed with dust (i.e., may you prosper).” So the believer should seek a woman who is religiously committed and good, even if she is not one of his relatives; by the same token, women should seek a righteous husband and ask about him, even if he is not one of her relatives.""(Fatawa Nur ‘ala ad-Darb\xa0 tape no. 831).\nFor more information, please see the answer the question no. 72263 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/140840/marrying-relatives-and-the-hadith-choose-strangers-for-marriage
217852,What is the Islamic view regarding a woman buying and selling during Jumu‘ah prayer?,"['Praise be to Allah.It is permissible for a woman to buy and sell during Jumu‘ah prayer, because she is not obliged to attend the prayer. That is on condition that the one who buys from her or sells to her is someone who is also not obliged to attend Jumu‘ah prayer, such as a woman, a minor or a traveller.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIt is prohibited to buy and sell, and it is obligatory to attend the prayer for those who are obliged to pray Jumu‘ah. In the case of others, such as women, minors and travellers, they are not subject to this prohibition, because Allah, may He be exalted, only forbade buying and selling to those whom He commanded to attend Jumu‘ah prayer. The prohibition does not apply to those who are not required to attend, and the reason for the prohibition is made clear; it is because of what would result from buying and selling of being distracted and prevented from attending Jumu‘ah prayer, and that is not applicable in their case.\nIf one of the parties to the transaction is obliged to attend Jumu‘ah and the other is not, then it is haram for the one who is obliged to attend and it is disliked (makruh) for the other party, because of what it involves of helping in sin.\nIt may even be that it is haram because Allah says: {do not cooperate in sin and transgression} [al-Ma’idah 5:2].\nAl-Mughni (2/73).\nWhat Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said about the possibility of it being haram if there is a transaction between two people, one of whom is obliged to attend Jumu‘ah and the other is not obliged, is a strong view that carries weight, because of the apparent meaning of the verse that he quoted. It is the view of many of the scholars (may Allah have mercy on them).\nJalal ad-Din al-Mahalli (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf two people engage in a transaction, one of whom is obliged to attend Jumu‘ah and the other is not, the other one is also sinning, because he is helping in something that is haram.""(Sharh al-Muhalli ‘ala Minhaj at-Talibin\xa0 1/335).\nIt says in al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (9/228): If Jumu‘ah is obligatory for one of them and not the other, then the view of the majority of Hanafis and Shafa‘is is that they are both sinning, because the first one, who was obliged to attend Jumu‘ah, has committed something that is prohibited, and the other one who is not obliged to attend, helped him in that.
