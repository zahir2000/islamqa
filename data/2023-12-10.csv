105457,"What is the shar‘i ruling on the following situation? Someone gave some agricultural land of a known acreage to someone else as collateral for a loan of a specific amount of money, to be kept until he is able to pay off the loan. The lender will take possession of the land temporarily and make use of it, and he will keep its yield for himself and not give any of it to the borrower, until the debt is paid. The time period for this collateral may last for decades, and the lender will not give the land back to its owner until after the debt is paid off in full. Firstly: what is the ruling on the yield that the lender will keep for the duration of this period – is it halal or haram? What should the one who does that do if this action is haram – does he have to repent from it? Secondly: what should the borrower, who gave this land as collateral because he was forced to do so by his financial circumstances, do? Thirdly: what should the witnesses to this contract of collateral do? Please note that the borrower stated in this contract that he permitted the lender to make use of this land without being given any share of the yield or any rent until the debt is paid off.","['Praise be to Allah.The lender’s use of the collateral is subject to further discussion:\nFirstly: if he uses it and benefits from it without the permission of the borrower, then that is not permissible under any circumstances, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “It is not permissible to take the wealth of any Muslim except with his willing consent.” And he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Your blood, your property and your honour are sacred to you, as sacred as this day of yours, in this land of yours, in this month of yours.” And he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Every Muslim is sacred to his fellow Muslim, his blood, his property and his honour.” And there are many hadiths which speak of this. So it is not permissible for the lender to make use of the property given as collateral without the permission of the borrower.\nIt says in al-Mughni: We do not know of any difference of scholarly opinion regarding this.\nBut if the borrower gave the lender permission to make use of the property given as collateral, if what is owed is a loan, then it is not permissible for the lender to make use of the property given as collateral, even if the borrower gave permission for that, because this comes under the heading of riba, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Every loan that brings a benefit is riba.” Even though there is some discussion about the soundness of this hadith, the scholars are unanimously agreed about that, that it is not permissible for the lender to make use of and benefit from the borrower’s property because of the loan. So this comes under the heading of riba, and it is not permissible to write that down or to witness it, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) cursed\xa0 the one who consumes riba, the one who pays it, the two who witness it and the one who writes it down.” And this comes under the heading of riba.\nSo if the debt is a loan, and the borrower gives something to the lender as collateral, it is not permissible for the lender to make use of it, whether the borrower gave permission or not, because this is riba.\nBut if the debt was not a loan, such as if it was the price for sold goods, for example, and the like, and he gives him permission to make use of it, then there is nothing wrong with that, because there is no reason to prevent it.

120984,We would like to know what the Salaf (righteous predecessors) believed concerning the Noble Quran.,"['Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“The belief of the Salaf (righteous predecessors) concerning the Quran is like their belief in all the Names and Attributes of Allah, which is a belief that is based on what is indicated by the Book of Allah and the Sunnah (traditions) of His Messenger (peace and blessings be upon him).\xa0\nWe all know that Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, has described the Quran as being His Word and that it was sent down from Him. Allah, may He be Sxalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And if any of the polytheists seeks your protection then grant him protection, so that he may hear the Word of Allah (the Quran), and then escort him to where he can be secure.” [At-Tawbah 9:6]\nUndoubtedly what is meant by the Word of Allah here is the Noble Quran .\nAnd He, may He be exalted, says:\n“Verily, this Quran narrates to the Children of Israel most of that about which they differ.” [An-Naml 27:76]\nSo the Quran is the Word of Allah in both wording and meaning. Allah spoke it in a real sense and gave it to Jibril (peace be upon him) the trustworthy, then Jibril brought it down to the heart of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), so that he might be one of the warners, in a plain Arabic tongue.\xa0\nThe Salaf believe that the Quran was revealed ; Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, revealed it to Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) piecemeal, i.e., bit by bit, over twenty-three years, in accordance with the Wisdom of Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted.\xa0\nMoreover, some of the revelation was revealed for a specific reason for which it was sent down, and some of it was revealed without a specific reason. Moreover, some of it was revealed to tell of something that happened to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his companions. Some of it was revealed concerning Shar`i (legal) rulings, according to what the scholars have said concerning this matter.\xa0\nThen the Salaf say that the Quran is from Allah in the first place and it will return (to Him) at the end of time. This is the view of the Salaf concerning the Noble Quran.\xa0\nIt is clear to us that Allah has described the Noble Quran in superlative terms. He has described it as wise (Hakim), noble (Karim), great (`Adhim), and glorious (Majid).\xa0\nThese qualities, in terms of which Allah has described His Book, may be attainable by one who adheres to this Book and acts upon it both inwardly and outwardly. Allah will give him some share of glory, greatness, wisdom, honour and authority that is not given to the one who does not adhere to the Book of Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted.\xa0\nHence I call all Muslims, rulers and ruled, scholars and ordinary folk, to adhere to the Book of Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, both inwardly and outwardly, so that they may attain honour, happiness and glory, and prevail in the east and in the west.” (Fatawa Kibar `Ulama Al-Ummah)\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/120984/belief-of-the-salaf-concerning-the-quran
286976,"I was surfing the Internet, and suddenly an ad popped up for the International Diamond Bank. When I clicked on it, it said that I had to pay $500 [to open an account], and they would add $150 to my account as a kind of initial support, and they would start to extract diamonds and sell them every four days. They would get in touch with me and ask me if I wanted to buy a particular diamond, and after four days they would sell it and I would receive the profit, and the bank would take 4% of the profit. Is it permissible to work with them?","['Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to work with what you have mentioned, because what the bank adds to your account, which is $150, is regarded as a loan, in return for your being a partner with them, and their acting as your broker in selling after that. It is not permissible to combine a loan and a business transaction according to the majority of jurists, because that is a loan which brings a benefit to the lender, and that is riba (usury).\nIn the hadith of ‘Amr ibn Shu‘ayb from his father, from his grandfather, it says: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “It is not permissible to arrange a loan combined with a sale.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (1234), Abu Dawud (3504) and al-Nasa’i (4611); classed as sahih by al-Tirmidhi and al-Albani.\nBased on this hadith, the jurists determine that it is haram to combine a loan with a business transaction.\nIt says in a statement of the Islamic Fiqh Council, explaining the prohibition on dealing in margins: Secondly, if the middleman stipulates that the customer should do business through him, this leads to combining a loan and a business transaction (brokerage), and this comes under the heading of combining a loan and a sale, which is prohibited according to Islamic teachings in the hadith of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “It is not permissible to arrange a loan combined with a sale.” Narrated by Abu Dawud (3/384) and by al-Tirmidhi (3/526), who said: It is a hasan sahih hadith.

88206,"I know that it is essential to say the name of Allah when slaughtering animals that are to be eaten, and that it is not permissible to eat from that over which the name of Allah has not been mentioned, but sometimes a Muslim has to travel to a non-Muslim country and stay there for several years, for work or study. Should he refrain from eating meat completely for this length of time or in this case is he regarded as compelled by necessity to eat meat or is it sufficient to say the name of Allah at the time of eating?","['Praise be to Allah.Saying Bismillah when slaughtering meat\xa0\nSaying the name of Allah is a condition of meat being permissible, and it is not excused by forgetting or not knowing, according to the most correct scholarly opinion.\xa0\nConditions of eating meat slaughtered by Christians and Jews\nMeat slaughtered by one of the people of the Book (a Jew or a Christian) is permissible subject to two conditions:\xa0\n\nThat the meat is slaughtered as a Muslim does it, by cutting the throat and oesophagus and letting the blood flow. If the animal is killed by strangling or electric shock or drowning in water, its meat is not permissible. Similarly, if a Muslim does that, the meat is not permissible.\xa0\nNo name other than that of Allah should be mentioned over it, such as the name of the Messiah etc, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n\n“Eat not (O believers) of that (meat) on which Allah’s Name has not been pronounced (at the time of the slaughtering of the animal).” [Al-An`am 6:121]\nAnd He says concerning prohibited things (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“He has forbidden you only the Maytah (dead animals), and blood, and the flesh of swine, and that which is slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than Allah (or has been slaughtered for idols, on which Allah’s Name has not been mentioned while slaughtering).” [Al-Baqarah 2:173]\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \xa0\n“What is meant here is that over which a name other than that of Allah is mentioned at the time of slaughter, such as saying “in the name of the Messiah” or “in the name of Muhammad” or “in the name of Jibril” or “in the name of Al-Lat” and so on.” (Tafsir Surat Al-Baqarah)\xa0\nThe prohibition also applies to that which is offered as a sacrifice to the Messiah or to Az-Zahrah, even if they did not mention a name other than that of Allah over it. It is also prohibited.\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\xa0\n“As for that which is slaughtered by the people of the Book for their festivals and as an act of worship to draw closer to someone other than Allah, as the Muslims offer their sacrifices to draw closer to Allah thereby, such as what they slaughter for the Messiah and Az-Zahrah, there are two reports narrated from Ahmad concerning that, the most well known of which in his texts is that it is not permissible to eat it, even if the name of someone other than Allah has not been mentioned over it. The prohibition on doing that was narrated from `Aishah and `Abdullah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with them).” (Iqtida’ Al-Sirat Al-Mustaqim, 1/251)\xa0\nCan Muslims eat meat if they don’t know whether the name of Allah was mentioned over it or not?\nIf a Muslim or a person from the people of the Book slaughters an animal for meat, and it is not known whether he mentioned the name of Allah over it or not, it is permissible to eat from it, and the one who eats it should say the name of Allah, because of the report that was narrated by Al-Bukhari (2057) from `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her), that some people said: O Messenger of Allah, some people bring meat to us, and we do not know whether they mentioned the name of Allah over it or not. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Mention the name of Allah over it and eat.”\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“It is not essential to ask about what was slaughtered by a Muslim or a person from the people of the Book, and how it was slaughtered, and whether the name of Allah was mentioned over it or not. Rather that should not be done, because that is being obstinate in religious matters. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) ate meat slaughtered by the Jews and did not ask questions.\nIn Al-Bukhari and elsewhere it is narrated from `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that some people said to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): Some people bring meat to us, and we do not know whether they mentioned the name of Allah over it or not. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Mention the name of Allah over it and eat.” She said: They were new in Islam, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told them to eat without asking, even though those who brought the meat to them may not have been aware of the rulings of Islam because they were new in Islam.” (Risalah fi Ahkam Al-Udhiyah wal-Dhakah by Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him))\nCan Muslims living in non-Muslim countries eat meat?\nBased on the above, whoever travels to a non-Muslim country where most of those who slaughter meat are Christians or Jews, it is permissible for him to eat their meat, unless he knows that they stun the animals or mention over them the name of someone other than Allah, as stated above.\xa0\nBut if the slaughterman is an idol-worshipper or communist, it is not permissible to eat meat slaughtered by him.\xa0\nIf the meat is prohibited , it is not permissible to eat from it on the grounds of necessity, so long as a person can find food to keep him alive, such as fish, vegetables and so on.\xa0\nShaykh `Abd Ar-Rahman Al-Barrak (may Allah preserve him) said:\xa0\n“The meat available in non-Muslim countries is of various types. As for fish, it is permissible in all cases, because its permissibility does not depend on the way in which it is slaughtered or on the name of Allah being mentioned over it.\nWith regard to other types of meat, if the companies or individuals who produce meat are from the People of the Book, Jews or Christians, and it is not known from them that they kill the animal by electric shock, strangling or striking it on the head, as is well known in the west, then this meat is permissible. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Made lawful to you this day are At-Tayyibat [all kinds of lawful foods, which Allah has made lawful (meat of slaughtered eatable animals, milk products, fats, vegetables and fruits)]. The food (slaughtered cattle, eatable animals) of the people of the Book (Jews and Christians) is lawful to you and yours is lawful to them.” [Al-Ma’idah 5:5]\xa0\nHowever, if they kill the animal by one of the methods mentioned, then the meat is prohibited, because in that case it is meat that has been strangled or killed by a blow. If those who produce the meat are not Jews or Christians, then the meat that they offer is prohibited. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Eat not (O believers) of that (meat) on which Allah’s Name has not been pronounced (at the time of the slaughtering of the animal), for sure it is Fisq (a sin and disobedience of Allah).” [Al-An`am 6:121]\nThe Muslim should strive to avoid that which is clearly prohibited and be cautious of doubtful matters so as to preserve his religious commitment and to keep his body safe from being nourished with haram things.”\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/88206/conditions-of-eating-meat-slaughtered-by-jews-and-christians
