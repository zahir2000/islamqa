113064,"This is a message that I have seen a lot on the Internet, but in fact I have not sent it to anyone because I am not sure if it is an innovation (Bid`ah) or not. Is it permissible to spread it and will we be rewarded for doing so, or is this not permissible because it is an innovation?","[""Praise be to Allah.You have done very well not to spread this message which is widespread on many websites on which uneducated attitudes and ignorance prevail.\xa0\nWith regard to those who published this message and want the Muslims to pray and recite Dhikr, we do not doubt that their intentions are good and great, especially if they want acts of obedience and worship to be done at a time when sins are being committed. However, this good and righteous intention does not make the actions legitimate, sound or acceptable in Shari`ah. Rather it is essential that the action be in accordance with Shari`ah in terms of its reason, type, quantity, manner, time and place. For a detailed discussion on these six categories, please see the answer to question number\xa021519 . In this manner the Muslim may distinguish between legitimate and innovated actions.\xa0\nWe may list the reasons why this message should not be spread by noting a number of points, including the following:\xa0\n\nThere have been Jahili special occasions [with practices similar to those in Jahiliyyah (i.e., the pre Islamic era)] and special occasions of the disbelievers and misguided since the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) until the present time, but we have not seen any text from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) which encourages us to do acts of worship and obedience at the time when others are committing acts of evil and disobedience, or to do prescribed actions at the time when innovated actions are being done. There is no report of any of the well-known imams recommending doing such a thing.\xa0\n\nThis comes under the heading of dealing with sin by means of innovation, as happened in the case of responding to the innovation of mourning on the occasion of 'Ashura , as done by the Rafidis, by introducing the innovation of spending a great deal and making a show of joy and happiness.\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“As for taking the days of calamities as occasions for mourning, this is not part of the religion of the Muslims; rather it is closer to the religion of Jahiliyyah. Thus they missed out on the virtue and reward of fasting on this day. Some other people introduced things on the basis of fabricated Hadiths for which there is no basis, such as the virtue of doing Ghusl on this day, or applying kohl to the eyes, or shaking hands. These and similar things are innovations, all of which are disliked. What is recommended is to fast on this day.\xa0\nThere are also well known reports about spending generously on one's family on this day, such as the Hadith of Ibrahim ibn Muhammad ibn Al-Muntashir from his father, who said: We heard that the one who spends generously on his family on the day of 'Ashura, Allah will give him in abundance for the rest of the year. This was narrated by Ibn `Uyaynah, but the fact that he said `we heard that…’ and it is not known who said it indicates that the chain of narrators is interrupted. It is most likely that this was fabricated because of the hatred that appeared between the Nasibis and Rafidis. The Rafidis regarded the day of 'Ashura as a day of mourning, so the Nasibis fabricated reports about it which indicated that one should spend generously on this day and take it as an `Eid. Both views are false.\n\xa0It is not permissible for anyone to change anything in Islam for the sake of anyone. Expressing joy and happiness on the day of `Ashura and spending generously on this day are all innovations that were introduced as a reaction against the Rafidis.” (Iqtida’ Al-Siraat Al-Mustaqeem, p. 300, 301)\xa0\nWe have quoted some other valuable words of Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah in the answer to question number\xa04033 .\xa0\n\nThere are special times for offering Du`a and prayers as prescribed in Islam. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) encouraged us to offer Du`a at these times, such as the last third of the night, which is the time when the Lord, may He be Glorified and Exalted, descends to the nearest heaven. Encouraging people to do that at a time when no authentic text has been narrated concerning it is introducing legislation concerning the reason or the time, and going against Shari`ah with regard to either of them is sufficient to deem the action to be a reprehensible innovation, so how about if it has to do with both of them?!\xa0\n\nIn the answer to question number\xa08375 , we were asked about giving charity to poor families at the time of the Gregorian New Year, and we replied that it is not allowed. Among the things that we said there was the following:\nIf we Muslims want to give in charity, we can give to those who really deserve it, and we should not aim to do that specifically on the days of the disbelievers’ festivals. We should do that whenever there is a need, and make the most of good and great occasions such as the month of Ramadan and the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah , and other virtuous occasions when rewards are multiplied.”\xa0\nThe basic principle for a Muslim is to follow (the Sunnah) and not introduce innovations. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Say (O Muhammad to mankind): `If you (really) love Allah, then follow me (i.e. accept Islamic Monotheism, follow the Quran and the Sunnah), Allah will love you and forgive you your sins. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.’\xa0\n32.\xa0Say (O Muhammad): `Obey Allah and the Messenger (Muhammad).” But if they turn away, then Allah does not like the disbelievers.’” [Al `Imran 3:21, 32]\xa0\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“This verse states that everyone who claims to love Allah but is not following the path of Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is lying in his claim unless he follows the path or religion of Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in all his words and deeds, as it is proven in an authentic report that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever introduces an action that is not part of this matter of ours will have it rejected.” (Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 2/32)\nShaykh Muhammad ibn Salih Al-`Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“You should love the Messenger more than you love yourselves, and your faith is not complete unless you do that. Do not introduce into his religion anything that is not part of it. What the seekers of knowledge should do is explain to the people and tell them: Occupy yourselves with legitimate and sound acts of worship; remember Allah; send blessings upon the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) at all times; establish regular prayer; pay Zakah; and be kind towards the Muslims at all times.” (Liqa’at Al-Bab Al-Maftuh, 35/5)\xa0\n\nYou are forgetting to do what you are obliged to do with regard to these sins and evils, which is enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil, offering sincere advice to those who are going against Islam, and focusing on individual acts of worship when there are other communal acts of disobedience and evil which you should not do.\xa0\n\nWhat we think is that it is prohibited to spread such messages and that it is an innovation to adhere to these acts of worship on such occasions. It is sufficient for you to warn against forbidden celebrations on occasions of shirk and innovation. You will be rewarded for that and you will be doing your duty with regard to these sins.\xa0\nPlease see the answer to question no.\xa060219 \xa0for some comments on good intentions and that good intentions will not benefit a person or make his innovated deeds rewardable.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/113064/spreading-messages-about-new-years-eve-dhikr-and-quran-gatherings
82392,What is the Islamic ruling on a woman travelling to seek knowledge without a Mahram?.,"['Praise be to Allah.The authentic evidence indicates that a woman is not allowed to travel except with a Mahram . This is part of the perfection and greatness of Islam, which protects honour, and takes care of women and holds them in high esteem, and strives to protect them and guard them against the causes of temptation and deviation, whether she is the one who is tempted or is the source of temptation.\xa0\nThe evidence includes the Hadith narrated by Al-Bukhari (1729) and Muslim (2391) from Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No woman should travel except with a Mahram , and no man should enter upon her unless there is a Mahram  with her.” A man said: “O Messenger of Allah, I want to go out with such and such an army and my wife wants to go for Hajj .” He said: “Go out with her.”\xa0\nBased on that, it is not permissible for a woman to travel to seek knowledge without a Mahram . She should acquire the knowledge that she needs in the many ways that are available, such as listening to tapes, asking scholars over the phone and other means that Allah has made available in these times.\xa0\nThe Standing Committee was asked: Can a woman go out to study medicine, if it is obligatory or permissible, if doing so will lead to the following things no matter how much she tries to avoid them:\xa0\n\nMixing with men, such as speaking to the patients, the tutor of medicine and on public transport.\nTravelling from a country such as Sudan to Egypt, even if the journey will take only hours, and not three days.\nIs it permissible for her to stay alone without a Mahram in order to learn medicine, if she is going to stay with a group of women, along with the circumstances described above?\n\nThey replied:\xa0\n\n“Firstly: if her going out to learn medicine will lead to her mixing with men during her study or when riding in mixed transportation that will lead to temptation, then it is not permissible for her to do that, because guarding her honour is an individual obligation, but learning medicine is a communal obligation, and an individual obligation takes precedence over a communal obligation. As for merely speaking to a patient or a teacher of medicine, that is not prohibited, rather what is prohibited is making the voice soft and appealing when speaking to him, which may tempt those in whose heart is the sickness of evil and hypocrisy. This does not apply only to learning medicine.\xa0\nSecondly: If she has a Mahram who can travel with her so that she can learn medicine, or teach it, or treat a patient, that is permissible. If she does not have a husband or Mahram who can travel with her, then it is prohibited, even if the journey is by plane, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No woman should travel except with a Mahram.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim). And because of what we have stated above about the interests of protecting honour taking precedence over the interests of learning medicine or teaching it, etc.\xa0\nThirdly: If her staying with a trustworthy group of women is so that she may learn medicine or teach it, or treat women, then it is permissible, but if there is the fear of temptation because of not having a husband or Mahram with her, then it is not permissible. If she is going to treat men, that is not permissible unless it is a dire need and she is not alone with a man .""

308208,"I wiped over see-through socks that had holes, thinking that it was permissible, because a long time ago I read a fatwa which said that it was permissible, and I prayed for a whole day like that. Then I researched the matter to make sure, and I read that what is most likely the case is that it is not permissible. Are my prayers valid?","['Praise be to Allah.Most of the scholars are of the view that it is not permissible to wipe over the socks unless they are thick and the foot or part of it cannot be seen through them.\nOthers are of the view that it is permissible to wipe over the socks even if they are thin. That was narrated from ‘Umar and ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with them), and was regarded as more correct by Shaykh al-Albani and Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on them).\nPlease see the answer to question no. 228222 .\nThere is no hadith from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to clarify this issue; rather it is a matter that is subject to ijtihad, and with regard to such matters, if the Muslim follows one of the two views based on a fatwa that he heard, then he finds out that the other view is more likely to be correct, then he should follow the other view, but the acts of worship that he did based on the first view are valid and he does not have to repeat them.\nAl-Hajawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said regarding one who realises that the qiblah is in a different direction from what he thought based on his own efforts to work it out:\nHe should pray facing the second direction, but he does not have to make up the prayers that he offered facing the first direction, which he thought was correct. End quote.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his commentary:\nThe words: “and he should pray facing the second direction and does not have to make up the prayers that he offered facing the first direction” mean: when he realises that he was mistaken, because he thought the first direction was correct, based on doing what was expected of him of trying to work it out, and whoever makes the effort that is expected of him does not have to repeat acts of worship that he did on that basis if he realizes that it was wrong, because if we say that he has to repeat those acts of worship, it would mean having to do each act of worship twice.\nSo if he prayed Zuhr facing towards the north, believing it to be the qiblah on the basis of his best efforts to work it out, then at ‘Asr time it became clear to him that the qiblah is towards the south, then he does not have to repeat Zuhr, because he offered that prayer based on what he thought was correct after doing what is enjoined of seeking to reach a conclusion (ijtihad), and the second ihtihad does not nullify acts of worship that were done on the basis of the first ijtihad.\nSimilarly, in issues of research, if a man develops a view on the grounds that this is what the texts indicate, then after further research and discussion he comes up with a view that is different from his first view, he does not have to undo a judgement, if he judged between people on the basis of his first view, and he does not have to undo his fatwa. So he does not have to go to the one to whom he gave a fatwa based on his first view and say: I gave you a fatwa, then I realised that that fatwa was wrong. That is because the first fatwa was based on ijtihad, so it cannot be rendered invalid by the second ijtihad.\nThe reason why we say that the first fatwa should not be undone is: as he thinks that he was mistaken in his first ijtihad, on the basis of which that fatwa was given, it is also possible that he could be mistaken in his second ijtihad. Perhaps the first one is the one that was correct, when he thought that the second one was correct. Hence the scholars said: ijtihad cannot be undone by further ijtihad.\nIt was narrated from ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) regarding the issue of al-himariyyah [a famous issue having to do with shares of inheritance, which is when the deceased leaves behind a husband, a mother, brothers through the mother and full brothers], that he ruled that the full brothers do not receive any share of inheritance. Then later on the same scenario happened again, and he ruled that they could be included. He was asked about that, and he said: That [the first ruling] was based on our ijtihad at the time, and this [the second ruling] is based on our ijtihad now. And he did not undo the first ruling.""(Al-Sharh al-Mumti‘\xa0 2/288).\nBased on that, your previous prayer is valid, because it was based on a fatwa issued by a scholar who thinks that is permissible.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/308208/he-wiped-over-see-through-socks-then-he-realised-that-that-is-not-permissible-what-should-he-do
197537,"I was wondering whether you could enlighten me further on the books of Allah (Subhana Wa Ta'ala). Were the books of Allah (Injil, Torah, Zabur) the exact words of Allah when they came down originally? I do not mean the books which Christians and Jews read now which have been altered. My question is again: were the books of Allah originally the exact words of God like the Quran is?","['Praise be to Allah.Articles of faith in Islam\nAllah, may He be ُxalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“The Messenger (Muhammad blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) believes in what has been sent down to him from his Lord, and (so do) the believers. Each one believes in Allah, His Angels, His Books , and His Messengers. They say, ‘We make no distinction between one another of His Messengers’” [Al-Baqarah 2:285].\xa0\nAl-Bukhari (50) and Muslim (9) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: One day the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) appeared before the people and Jibril came to him and said: O Messenger of Allah, what is faith? He said: “To believe in Allah, His angels, His Books, the meeting with Him, and His Messengers, and to believe in the resurrection hereafter.”\xa0\nThe Quran, the Torah, the Gospel and the Zabur are all among the Books of Allah that He sent down to His Messengers (blessings and peace of Allah be upon them), and it is obligatory to believe in them. Whoever disbelieves in any of them has disbelieved in Allah.\xa0\nAre the words of Allah created?\nNothing of the words of Allah is created. He, may He be Glorified, spoke the Torah, the Gospel , the Quran and the Zabur in a real sense.\xa0\nSimilarly, not a single letter of the Quran is created. It is all the words of Allah in a real sense. The same is also true of the Torah, the Gospel and the Zabur. We do not differentiate between the Messengers of Allah, and we do not differentiate between the revealed Books; all of them are the words of Allah.\xa0\nAllah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Do you (faithful believers) covet that they will believe in your religion in spite of the fact that a party of them (Jewish rabbis) used to hear the Word of Allah (Torah), then they used to change it knowingly after they understood it?”\xa0[Al-Baqarah 2:75]\nWhat they used to distort is the Torah , but here Allah, may He be Exalted, calls it the “Word of Allah”.\xa0\nMuslim (2652) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Adam and Musa debated. Musa said: O Adam, you are our father but you caused our doom and caused us to be expelled from Paradise. Adam said to him: You are Musa, Allah chose you to speak to and wrote (the Torah) for you with His own hand. Are you blaming me for something that Allah decreed for me forty years before He created me?” The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Adam got the better of Musa, Adam got the better of Musa.”\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“The view of the early generations, the Companions and those who followed them in truth, and all the leading scholars of the Muslims, such as the four Imams and others, is that which is indicated by the Quran and Sunnah, which is what is in accordance with the clear rational evidence: that the Quran is the word of Allah that was revealed and not created; it comes from Him and will return to Him. He is the One Who spoke the Quran, the Torah and the Gospel, and other words; they are not created and separate from Him. He, may He be Glorified, speaks by His will and power, and His word is within His Essence, and is not a creation separate from Him […] The words of Allah have no end, as Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “Say (O Muhammad blessings and peace of Allah be upon him to mankind): ‘If the sea were ink for (writing) the Words of my Lord, surely, the sea would be exhausted before the Words of my Lord would be finished, even if we brought (another sea) like it for its aid’” [Al-Kahf 18:109].\xa0\nAllah, may He be Glorified, spoke the Quran in Arabic and the Torah in Hebrew […]\xa0Whoever regards His words as created must say: Is that which is created the One Who spoke to Musa: “Verily! I am Allah! La ilaha illa Ana (none has the right to be worshipped but I), so worship Me, and perform As-Salat (Iqamat As-Salat) for My Remembrance” [Ta-Ha 20:14]. This is impossible; these cannot be anything other than the words of the Lord of the Worlds. As Allah spoke the Quran, the Torah, and other Scriptures, with their meanings and words which consist of letters, none of that is created; rather that is the words of the Lord of the Worlds.” (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 12/37-41) (See also: Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 12/355-356)\xa0\nShaykh Mustafa Ar-Ruhaybani (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Swearing by the words of Allah, may He be Exalted, or the Quran, or a surah or verse thereof, is a (valid) oath, because it is one of His attributes. So whoever swears by it or by any part of it has sworn an oath by one of the attributes of Allah, may He be Exalted.\xa0\nThe same applies to swearing by the Torah or any of the other Books of Allah, may He be exalted, such as the Gospel and the Zabur. This is an oath for which expiation is required (if it is broken), because an oath sworn by the Torah or Gospel in general terms is swearing by that which was sent down from Allah, may He be Exalted, not that which has been changed or altered, and the sanctity thereof is not waived by the fact that it has been abrogated by the rulings of the Quran, as is similar to the case of some verses in the Quran the rulings of which were abrogated. That does not alter the fact that it is the words of Allah, may He be Exalted, and as it is His words, it is one of His attributes, as is the Quran."" (Matalib Uli An-Nuha,\xa06/361)\xa0\nShaykh Ibn Jibrin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“It is well-known that Allah sent down Books to the Prophets. He sent down the Torah to Musa, He sent down the Gospel to `Isa , He sent down the Zabur to Dawud, and He sent down Scripture (Suhuf) to Ibrahim , as\xa0 He said (interpretation of the meaning): “The Scriptures of Ibrahim (Abraham) and Musa (Moses)” [Al-A`la 87:19].
