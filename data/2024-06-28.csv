385395,Are zombies kufr to believe in and is blasphemy if it's both then answer by say both if it's one of them say which one.,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe term “zombie”\nA zombie is a reanimated corpse that is made to move by means of witchcraft. The word is usually used to describe someone who has been put to sleep and has lost consciousness. From the end of the nineteenth century, the character of the zombie became noticeably popular, especially in North America and in European folklore. In the modern era, the word zombie is used to refer to the living dead in horror movies.\nSecondly:\nThe idea of zombies is in harmony with denial of the resurrection and belief in the transmigration of souls.\nAccording to Islamic creed, there is no such thing as zombies or the living dead who come back to life and eat others, or do not eat. Everyone who dies will remain dead until Allah resurrects him on the Day of Resurrection, and there is no exception to that except in very few cases, where Allah brought people back to life as a miracle for a Prophet of His, as He did for ‘Isa (peace be upon him).\nAs for the rest of the dead, they will remain in al-barzakh, enjoying bliss or suffering torment, until Israfil gives the second trumpet blast, whereupon they will come back to life and emerge from their graves, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{ And the Horn [Trumpet]. Will be blown; and at once from the graves to their Lord they will hasten}\xa0[Ya-Sin 36:51];\nthat is, they will emerge from their graves.\nAnd Allah has told us that at the time of death, the disbelievers ask to go back to this world so that they might do righteous deeds, and He, may He be glorified, has stated that that will not happen, and that He has spoken and ruled that they will never go back, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{[For such is the state of the disbelievers], until, when death comes to one of them, he says, “My Lord, send me back,\nThat I might do righteousness in that which I left behind.” No! It is only a word he is saying; and behind them is a barrier until the Day they are resurrected}\xa0[Al-Mu’minun 23:99-100].\nAt-Tirmidhi (3010) and Ibn Majah (2800) narrated that Jabir ibn ‘Abdillah said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) met me and said to me: “O Jabir, why do I see you looking downcast?” I said: O Messenger of Allah, my father has been martyred, and he left behind dependents and debt. He said: “Shall I not give you the glad tidings of how Allah received your father? I said: Of course, O Messenger of Allah. He said: “Allah has never spoken to anyone except from behind a screen, but He brought your father back to life and spoke to him directly, and said, ‘O My slave, wish and I shall grant it to you.’ He said, ‘O my Lord, bring me back to life so that I may be killed for Your sake a second time.’ The Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, said, ‘I have already decreed that they will not return (to the world after death).’”\nBelief in the existence of the living dead who exist at present or will exist in the future constitutes disbelief that is contrary to what is well established according to Islamic teachings, which is that the one who dies will not return; rather he will remain in al-barzakh until the Day of Resurrection.\nThe idea of zombies is in harmony with denial of the resurrection and belief in the transmigration of souls. Those who believe in this idea base it on the view that there will be no resurrection in the hereafter; rather a person will die and return repeatedly, without end, or he will die and his soul will move to another body. Denial of the resurrection constitutes disbelief (kufr).\nConclusion:\nThe idea that the dead can return to this world constitutes disbelief (kufr) and is a rejection of the religious texts. If, in addition to that, there is denial of the resurrection and the reckoning, then this is misguidance upon misguidance.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/385395/does-believing-in-the-existence-of-zombies-constitute-disbelief-kufr
266793,"We had 1 talaq. After 6 months my husband said if you go you are divorced. I left. We were bit careless but also I didn't know much of conditional talaq and it was our 2nd incident of talaq so I was't worrried. I thought if it's a talaq still it'll be only 2nd. It often bothered me but I couldn't ask him. After few years we had 1 more talaq then I asked him about the conditional divorce. First he didn't remember it since the incident was few years old. Then he said that he said free. I told my husband that some ulima say word talaq depends on intention in conditional talaq. Then he said; I said free and I don't remember if I said word talaq but if I said word talaq I didn\'t intend it. He also said why you didn't remind me before 3rd incident. I know his words are taken about his intention because he knows better but does same ruling apply in our situation like, he forgot. I know he said word talaq so to me he forgot and our 3rd incident occured after few years so by the time if he can forget his word then now he can forget his intention too. In your opinion conditional talaq depends on intention but my question is; If I clearly remember that he said word talaq when he said if you go you are divorced and he doesn't remember because he says he said free then should his statement about his intention that he said free but if he said word talaq he didn't intend it, still be acceptable, even he FORGOT his word because he says he said free, while I remember he said word talaq","['Praise be to Allah.If a man says to his wife, “If you go, then you are divorced,” this is a divorce that is dependent on a condition.\nThe majority of scholars are of the view that it counts as a divorce if she goes.\nSome of the scholars are of the view that it depends on the husband’s intention. If he did not intend divorce – rather he intended to prevent her from going – then it comes under the ruling on oaths, and if she goes, he must offer expiation for breaking an oath (kaffarat yamin).\nThis is the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, and it is the basis on which we give answers on our website.\nBased on that, if the husband says that he did not intend divorce when he said that, or he forgot what he said, and he says, “Assuming that I said that, I did not intend divorce,” then it does not count as a divorce; rather he must offer expiation for breaking an oath.\nWhat appears to be the case from your question is that your husband is certain that he did not intend divorce, even if he has forgotten what he actually said.\nBased on that, no divorce has taken place.\nBut if even we assume that the word of divorce was very clear and the divorce took place as soon as he uttered the word of divorce, meaning that it was not dependent on anything, and he used clear words of divorce, then the woman must count this as a divorce, even if the husband forgot what he said, because a clear statement of divorce which took place immediately is not dependent on what the husband intended.\nSee also the answer to question no. 116641 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/266793/he-issued-a-conditional-divorce-and-forgot-what-he-said
