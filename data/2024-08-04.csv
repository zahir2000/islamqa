198536,"I have four children, the oldest of whom is nine years old. Usually I used to buy them Ribena and Lucozade, and sweets, until one of my friends told me that Lucozade contains 0.01% alcohol and Ribena goes through a filter that is made of porcine gelatin. I researched on the Internet and I found that according to the Sharia Council in the UK it is halal. That was in 2004.","['Praise be to Allah.In our response, we would like to note the following:\n1. It is not permissible for the Muslim at all to add any alcohol or pork products, or other prohibited substances, to any of his food or drink, even if it is a small amount, because he is enjoined to avoid all of that.\n2. If the Muslim finds any kind of food or drink being sold in the market, and he is not certain about it, or he does not think it is very likely that some haram substance has been added to it, then the basic principle is that food or drink is permissible, and mere doubt or suspicion on its own does not affect anything.\n3. If he finds out that some alcohol or pork product, or any other haram substance, has been added to the food or drink, then if it is a small amount that is absorbed into the other substances, and no trace of it remains in the food or drink, meaning that no colour, taste or smell of it can be discerned, then this does not affect anything either, and it is not prohibited to consume those foods or drinks. This is the case with regard to the small amount mentioned in the question. Such small amounts are absorbed into what they are added to, and no trace of them remains.\n4. It is haram to consume any of these foods or drinks if a large amount of haram substances that leaves a trace has been added to them, or a small amount has been added, but it leaves a trace and is not absorbed; rather some of its characteristics remain, such as its colour, taste, smell or any other trace, such as an intoxicating effect in the case of alcohol and other intoxicating substances.\n5. With regard to intoxicating substances, it is not stipulated that the amount of this food that is normally consumed should not cause intoxication. It is well known that sweets and chocolates cannot contain enough alcohol to cause intoxication directly from the amount that people usually consume. Rather the Islamic principle regarding this matter is that what causes intoxication in large amounts, a small amount of it is haram.\n6. There is a general principle and Islamic etiquette that is prescribed for the believer, which says that whatever you feel uncomfortable about, and whatever causes you to feel doubt and un-ease, you should leave it, and take from the good (halal) options that do not cause you to feel that way, because the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Leave that which makes you doubt for that which does not make you doubt, for what is true brings reassurance and what is false brings doubt.” Narrated by at-Tirmidhi (2442) and others; classed as sahih by al-Albani. And the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “That which is halal is clear and that which is haram is clear, and between them are doubtful matters which many people do not understand. Whoever guards against the doubtful matters will protect his religious commitment from shortcomings and will protect his honour from slander, but whoever falls into that which is doubtful will fall into that which is haram, like a shepherd who grazes his flock around reserved land; he will soon graze in it. Verily, every king has his reserved land and verily, the reserved land of Allah is that which He has forbidden.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (1910) and Muslim (2996).\nSee also the answer to question no. 114129 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/198536/ruling-on-sweets-which-contain-a-very-small-amount-of-alcohol
242838,"Is the wife entitled to a monthly allowance that is just for her, especially if she has no source of income except what her husband gives her?","['Praise be to Allah.Obligation to spend on wife\xa0\nWhat the husband must do is spend on his wife on a reasonable basis, which includes the costs of accommodation, food, drink and clothing, according to scholarly consensus, and includes medical treatment and medicine according to the more correct opinion.\n\nWith regard to accommodation, that is because Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n“Lodge them (the divorced women) where you dwell, according to your means, and do not treat them in such a harmful way that they are obliged to leave.” [At-Talaq 65:6]\nIf this refers to one who is divorced, then it is more applicable to one who is not divorced.\n\nWith regard to food, drink and clothing, that is because Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n“but the father of the child shall bear the cost of the mother’s food and clothing on a reasonable basis.” [Al-Baqarah 2:233]\nAnd the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Their rights over you are that you should provide for them and clothe them on a reasonable basis.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1218)\nIt was narrated that Mu`awiyah Al-Qushayri said: I said: O Messenger of Allah, what are the rights of the wife of one of us over him? He said: “That you should feed her as you feed yourself, clothe her as you clothe yourself, not strike her on the face or curse her, and not forsake her except in the house (as a form of discipline).” (Narrated by Abu Dawud (2142) and Ibn Majah (1850). Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud)\nIbn Rushd (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“The scholars agreed that the rights that the wife has over the husband include maintenance and clothing, because Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“but the father of the child shall bear the cost of the mother’s food and clothing on a reasonable basis.” [Al-Baqarah 2:233], and because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Their rights over you are that you should provide for them and clothe them on a reasonable basis”; and he said to Hind: “Take what is sufficient for you and your child, on a reasonable basis.”\xa0\nWith regard to maintenance, the scholars agreed that it is obligatory.” (Bidayat Al-Mujtahid wa Nihayat Al-Muqtasid, 2/44)\n\nWith regard to medical treatment and medicine, please see the answer to question no.\xa083815 .\n\nHow much money should I give my wife each month?\nIf the husband does that, he has done what is required of him, and he is not obliged to do anything beyond that, or to give his wife a personal allowance , unless he chooses to do so.\nVirtue of being generous towards one’s family\nBut the husband should understand the virtue of being generous towards his dependents , and treating his family kindly, and should understand that whatever he spends on his wife , he will be rewarded for it, for giving gifts increases love. So if he is well off, he should not refuse to give her this allowance, especially if she does not have any other source of income.\nAl-Bukhari (55) and Muslim (1002) narrated from Abu Mas`ud Al-Badri (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If a man spends on his family, seeking reward for that with Allah, then it will be counted as an act of charity on his part.”\nAnd Muslim (994) and others narrated from Thawban, the freed slave of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), [that he said]: “The best dinar that a man spends is a dinar that he spends on his dependents, and a dinar that a man spends on his mount (for Jihad) for the sake of Allah, and a dinar that he spends on his companions (in Jihad) for the sake of Allah.”\nAbu Qilabah said: He began by mentioning his dependents. Then Abu Qilabah said: What man earns a greater reward than a man who spends on his young dependents, whom Allah keeps from needing people or benefits or makes independent of means through him?\nAl-Bukhari (1295) and Muslim (1628) narrated from Sa`d ibn Abu Waqqas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to him: “You will never spend anything, seeking thereby the pleasure of Allah, but you will be rewarded for it, even a morsel that you put in your wife’s mouth.”\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/242838/how-much-money-should-i-give-my-wife-each-month
493239,"What is the ruling on traces of impurity (najasah) left after cleaning oneself with pebbles that may be overlooked, if they get onto the clothes or body?","['Praise be to Allah.Scholars differed regarding traces of impurity left after cleaning oneself with pebbles, if they move from their place onto the body or clothes.\nThe Hanafis are of the view that traces of impurity that remain after cleaning oneself with pebbles are overlooked, if they move onto the clothes or body.\nIbn al-Humam (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The later scholars are agreed that sweat is not regarded as impure (najis); even if it runs down the face and\xa0 more than the size of a dirham of it gets onto the clothes and body, it does not matter.""(Fath al-Qadir\xa0 1/214).\nThe Shafa‘i scholars are of the view that traces of impurity that are left after cleaning oneself with pebbles are to be overlooked, if they move from their place to the body or clothes.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If, as a result of sweating, the impurity moves from its place to another part of the body or the garment, either of the two rulings may apply, but the more correct view is that it is overlooked, because it is too difficult to avoid that.""(Rawdat at-Talibin\xa0 1/279).\nAr-Ramli (may Allah have mercy on him) said: What is left of traces of impurity in the place that was cleaned with pebbles may be overlooked, because it is permissible for him to limit himself to using pebbles, and if the place where the traces remain sweats, and the traces contaminate other parts of the body or clothing, that is also overlooked, because it is too difficult to avoid that.""(Nihayat al-Muhtaj\xa0 2/25).\nThe Hanbalis, according to the well-known view, say that it is not overlooked. This is based on their view that using pebbles only does not clean the impure place properly.\nAccording to the second view of their madhhab, it is overlooked, because using pebbles to clean oneself purifies the place. This was narrated from Imam Ahmad.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Heavy impurity may be overlooked because of its location in three cases, the first of which is the place that is cleaned using pebbles. Traces of impurity that are left after cleaning oneself with the required number of pebbles may be overlooked, and there is no difference of opinion as far as we know.\nOur companions differed as to whether the place that is cleaned using pebbles and in which some trases of impurity remain becomes pure:\nAbu ‘Abdillah ibn Haamid and Abu Hafs ibn al-Muslim were of the view that it becomes pure (even if some traces of impurity remain). This is the apparent meaning of Ahmad’s words, because he said, regarding one who had cleaned himself with pebbles and then sweats and the sweat gets onto his trousers: It does not matter.\nThe reason for that is what the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said regarding dried dung and worn-out bones: “They do not purify.” What may be understood from this is that other things do purify, because what is meant is that it removes the description of impurity as water does.\nOur later companions said: The place does not become pure; rather it remains impure. So if the one who had cleaned himself with pebbles [and some trace of impurity remained] were to sit in a small amount of water, that water would become impure, and if he were to sweat, his sweat would be impure, because wiping does not remove all the traces of impurity, so what remains of that is impure, because it is the trace of an impure substance.""(Al-Mughni\xa0 2/486 – at-Turki edn.).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin favoured the view that the small amount that remains after cleaning oneself with pebbles may be overlooked.\nIn his Sharh, he (may Allah have mercy on him) quoted the words of the author of az-Zad: The traces that remain after cleaning oneself with pebbles is overlooked if it remains in its place.\nFrom the phrase “in its place”, it is known that if the impurity goes beyond its place, it is not overlooked, such as if he sweats and his sweat runs down and passes through that place, and ends up on his trousers, garment or buttocks. In that case it is not overlooked, because it has gone beyond its place.\nFrom his words, it may be understood that cleaning oneself with pebbles does not purify, and that the traces left are impure, but may be overlooked if they remain in their place.\nBut the correct view is that if the conditions of cleaning oneself with pebbles are met, then it does purify.\nThe evidence for that is the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) concerning bones and dried dung: “They do not purify.” Its isnad is jayyid (good).\nThe Prophet’s words, “They do not purify,” indicate that cleaning oneself with other things that are permissible to use for that purpose does purify. Based on this view, which is the more correct view, if the traces of impurity go beyond their place, and travel with his sweat onto his trousers, his trousers do not become impure, because cleaning oneself with pebbles purifies, but there is no stipulation that he should use water too, so as to make it easier for the Muslims.""(Ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘ ‘ala Zad al-Mustaqni‘\xa0 1/445-446).\nBased on the above:\nThe more correct view is that what remains of a small amount of impurity after cleaning oneself with pebbles is overlooked, even if it moves onto the person’s garment or body, because this is what appears to have been the case from the conduct of the Sahabah: they would sweat and their garments would come in contact with traces of impurity left in place after cleaning themselves with pebbles, but it was never narrated from even one of them that they used to wash that away. Moreover, this matter is very difficult to avoid, yet there is nothing in the reports to suggest that there is any exception to the ruling on cleaning oneself with pebbles in the event of the traces of impurity getting onto the garment or body. This indicates that the matter is to be overlooked.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/493239/what-is-the-ruling-on-a-small-amount-of-impurity-najasah-left-after-cleaning-oneself-with-pebbles-if-it-gets-onto-the-body-or-clothes
20013,People say that no Qada’ (due) prayer can be offered immediately after the 'Asr' prayer. Please help by giving me a comprehensive answer regarding this saying.,"['Praise be to Allah.Forbidden prayer times\nThere are some times at which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) disallowed prayer . These are:\xa0\n\nFrom after Fajr prayer until the sun has appeared and risen to the height of a spear, i.e., approximately fifteen minutes. (Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti’, 4/162)\nThe time when the sun is at its zenith in the middle of the sky. This is a short time before the time for Dhuhr prayer begins, approximately one-quarter of an hour or twenty minutes. (Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 11/286). Some of the scholars said that it was shorter than that. Ibn Qasim (may Allah have mercy on him) said that it is a brief time period, not even long enough to pray, only enough to say the Takbir to start the prayer. (Hashiyat Ibn Qasim `ala Ar-Rawd Al-Murbi`, 2/245)\xa0\nAfter `Asr prayer until the sun sets.\xa0\n\nThese three times were mentioned in many Hadiths in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade praying at these times . These Hadiths include the following:\xa0\n\nAl-Bukhari (586) and Muslim (728) narrated that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: `There is no prayer after `Asr prayer until the sun has set, and no prayer after Fajr prayer until the sun has risen.’”\xa0\nMuslim (832) narrated that `Amr ibn `Abasah As-Sulami (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I said, `O Prophet of Allah, tell me what Allah has taught you and I do not know, tell me about the prayer.’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: `Pray Subh (Fajr) prayer, then do not pray until the sun has appeared and risen… then pray for your prayer is witnessed and attended (by the angels), until the shadow of a spear points due north\xa0 – which is the time when the sun is in the middle of the sky – then stop praying, for at that time Hell is stoked up. When the shadow turns – which is the beginning of the time for Dhuhr – then pray, for your prayer is witnessed and attended (by the angels), until you pray `Asr. Then stop praying until the sun sets…”\xa0\n\nCan we make up for a missed prayer after `Asr?\nWhat is meant by making up prayers is doing the prayer after the time for that prayer is over. The made-up prayer may be either obligatory or supererogatory.\xa0\n\nObligatory prayers: The Muslims must pray regularly at the times defined by Allah for each prayer. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n\n“Verily, the prayer is enjoined on the believers at fixed hours.” [An-Nisa’ 4:103]\nDelaying the prayer until its time is over without a reason or excuse is prohibited, and it is a major sin.\xa0\nIf the Muslim has an excuse, such as sleeping or forgetting, and he was not able to do the prayer on time, then he must make up the prayer when that reason no longer applies , even if that is at one of the times when prayer is disallowed. This is the view of the majority of scholars. (See Al-Mughni, 2/515)\xa0\nThe evidence for that is the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Whoever sleeps and misses the prayer or forgets it, let him pray it when he remembers .” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 597 and Muslim, 684)\xa0\n\nSunnah prayers : the scholars differed with regard to making them up at times when prayer is disallowed. The correct view is that they should be made up . This is the view of Ash-Shafi`i (may Allah have mercy on him). (See Al-Majmu`, 4/170) It was also the view favoured by Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him), as stated in Al-Fatawa, 23/127. This is indicated by a number of Hadiths, such as:\xa0\n\nThe report narrated by Al-Bukhari (1233) and Muslim (834) from Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her), that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prayed two Rak`ahs after `Asr, and she asked him about that. He said: “Some people from `Abd Al-Qays came to me and distracted me from praying two Rak`ahs after Dhuhr, so I did them now.”\xa0\nIbn Majah (1154) narrated that Qays ibn `Amr said: the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw a man praying two Rak`ahs after he had prayed Fajr prayer. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Are you praying Fajr twice?” The man said to him, “I did not pray the two Rak`ahs that come before it , so I offered them now.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) remained silent. This was classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah (984). Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: the fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) remained silent indicates that it is permissible. (Al-Mughni, 2/532)\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad and grant him peace.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20013/can-we-make-up-missed-prayer-after-asr
