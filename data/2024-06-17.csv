371193,"I heard someone say that all those who achieved conquests were Ash‘aris, such as Salaah ad-Din al-Ayyubi, Muhammad al-Faatih, ‘Umar al-Mukhtar, and others, and there was no one who was Salafi. Is this true?","['Praise be to Allah.Most of the conquests happened at the time of the earliest and best generations, such as the conquests of the Persians and the Byzantines, and the conquests of Syria, Egypt, North Africa, Andalusia, India and Sindh; in other words, from the ocean to the ocean. All of that happened before Abu’l-Hasan al-Ash‘ari was even born!\nBut after the era of al-Ash‘ari (d. 324 AH), whatever wars or conquests took place, people of mixed backgrounds took part in them, and whether the commander was a Salafi or an Ash‘ari or a Karrami, all kinds of people took part in them. For example, Ibn Qudamah and other people of Bayt al-Maqdis, who were Salafis, took part in campaigns with Salah ad-Din, and Ibn Taymiyah took part in the wars against the Tatars.\nThis argument is pointless and that there is no evidence in it to suggest that a certain school of thought (in ‘aqidah) is right or wrong. If conquest was proof of the soundness of a belief, then all of the early conquests would point to the soundness of the Salafi madhhab.\nBut what we may learn from this discussion is that when the ummah is faced with external danger, they unite, cooperate and set aside their differences, and the Salafis fight alongside the Ash‘aris and the Sufis to repel the enemy who, if they conquer the Muslim lands, will commit mischief without differentiating between one school of thought and another.\nAs for the one who has some innovated beliefs or practices, he may be excused if he based his innovation on his own efforts to reach a conclusion, or it was based on the misinterpretation of some text, or he followed a shaykh in that regard. So he is not to be punished for his innovation, and he may be rewarded for his good intention and efforts to reach the right conclusion, as well as his efforts in support of Islam. This is how Ahl as-Sunnah evaluate many of the scholars who were known for their knowledge, righteousness and jihad, if they belonged to a group that followed innovation. They seek excuses for them and think positively of them; they mention the virtues that they had and they note that they did not refrain from striving in jihad, whether the ruler was righteous or evil.\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Kathir said, in his biography of the righteous shaykh Abu ‘Umar al-Maqdisi:\n… He was the brother of Shaykh Muwaffaq ad-Din ‘Abdullah ibn Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Qudaamah. Abu ‘Umar was older than him, because he was born in 528 AH, in the village of as-Sawiya – or, it was said, in Jama‘il – and he raised Shaykh Muwaffaq ad-Din; he treated him kindly, helped him to get married and took care of him.…\nHe and his brother, and his maternal cousin al-Hafiz ‘Abd al-Ghani and his brother Shaykh al-‘Imad never stayed behind from any campaign in which the ruler Salah ad-Din went out to the land of the Franks. They were present with him at the conquest of al-Quds (Jerusalem) and on other campaigns.""(Al-Bidayah wa’n-Nihayah\xa0 17/21).\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nNot everyone who differs in some matters of creed is necessarily doomed. The one who differs (regarding some matters of creed) may have studied the religious texts but come to a wrong conclusion, and Allah may forgive his mistake. Or some text concerning that issue may not have reached him, on the basis of which proof could be established against him; or he may have some good deeds to his credit by means of which Allah will erase his bad deeds. If there is some word of warning in the religious texts that applies to him, of the type for which the one who misinterprets the text or repented, or the one who has good deeds that could erase his bad deeds is not included in the warning, then it is more appropriate [to believe that such people will not be doomed].""(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa (3/179). See also: Mihnah Ibn Taymiyah in ash-Shaamilah (34).\nWhatever the case, what matters is following the Qur’an and Sunnah, and the way of the Companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), for this is the criterion by which we may determine whether a belief is sound or not. As for jihad, it is something that a Khariji or Mu‘tazili or Sufi or Ash‘ari or Sunni may be involved in, and it is not indicative of the soundness of his belief.\nIn the modern era, the Salafis have fought in jihad, conquered lands and attained victory, and they are no less in that regard than others.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/371193/were-the-majority-of-the-islamic-conquests-carried-out-by-the-asharis
357385,"Is the one who could have asked about the ruling on some action, but did not ask, regarded as if proof was established against him? For example, if he is not sure whether doing something is a sin or not, then he decided not to ask about the ruling on it, is there any sin on him if he goes ahead and does that thing, when that thing is a sin? If possible, please refer to scholarly views on this issue, and say which you think is most likely to be correct, if there is no consensus on the matter.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nWhat the Muslim must do is learn before he acts. So it is not permissible for him to go ahead and do something when he does not know the ruling on it. That becomes more important if he is not sure whether that thing is a sin or not.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And do not pursue that of which you have no knowledge. Indeed, the hearing, the sight and the heart - about all those [one] will be questioned}\xa0[al-Isra’ 17:36].\nShaykh Muhammad al-Amin ash-Shinqiti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIn this verse, Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, forbids pursuing that of which one has no knowledge… That includes speaking without knowledge, or doing some actions about which one has no knowledge. And Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, refers to this meaning in other verses.""(Adwa’ al-Bayan\xa0 3/682).\nImam al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his Sahih:\nChapter: Learning before speaking or acting, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {So know, [O Muhammad], that there is no god worthy of worship except Allah} [Muhammad 47:19]; thus He began with knowledge.\nThe scholars are the heirs of the prophets, who left behind a legacy of knowledge. Whoever acquires that knowledge has taken an abundant share, and whoever follows a path seeking knowledge, Allah will make easy for him a path to Paradise.\nAllah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Only those fear Allah, from among His servants, who have knowledge}\xa0[Fatir 35:28]\n{But none will understand them except those of knowledge}\xa0[al-‘Ankabut 29:43]\n{And they will say, “If only we had been listening or reasoning, we would not be among the companions of the Blaze”}\xa0[al-Mulk 67:10]\n{Are those who know equal to those who do not know?}\xa0[az-Zumar 39:9].\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When Allah wills good for a person, He grants him understanding of religion” and “Knowledge is only acquired through learning.” Abu Dharr said: If you put this sword on here – and he pointed to the back of his neck – then I thought that I could convey a word I heard from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) before you kill me, I would convey it.\nIbn ‘Abbas said: Be pious scholars of the Lord, possessed of forbearing and understanding. It was said that the pious scholar [rabbani] is the one who starts by teaching people easy issues of knowledge before difficult issues.\nIbn Majah narrated that Anas ibn Malik said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Seeking knowledge is obligatory for every Muslim.”\nIbn ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIt was narrated that Ishaq ibn Rahawayh said: Seeking knowledge is obligatory, although there is no soundly-narrated report which says that. But what is meant is that the individual must seek the knowledge of how to do what he needs to do, such as wudu’ and prayer, zakah if he has wealth, and also Hajj and so on…\nAbu ‘Umar said: Ishaq meant – and Allah knows best – that regarding the hadith about the obligation to seek knowledge, there are some reservations among the scholars of hadith about its isnad, but its meaning is correct in their view…\nThen he narrated with his isnad from ‘Ali ibn al-Hasan ibn Shaqiq that the latter said: I said to Ibn al-Mubarak: What is the thing that the believer cannot do unless he seeks knowledge about it? And what must he learn? He said: He cannot take any action except on the basis of knowledge, and he cannot acquire knowledge unless he asks.""(Jami‘ Bayan al-‘Ilm wa Fadlihi\xa0 1/52-56).\nThis is a matter on which the scholars are agreed.\nAl-Qarafi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAl-Ghazali narrated in Ihya’ ‘Ulum ad-Din that there was consensus on that. Ash-Shafa‘i also narrated in ar-Risalah that it is not permissible for the accountable person to take any action until he knows the ruling of Allah concerning it. So the one who becomes involved in buying and selling must learn the rulings and guidelines that Allah has prescribed with regard to buying and selling. The one who gets involved in renting and hiring must learn what Allah, may He be exalted, has prescribed with regard to renting and hiring. The one who wants to lend or borrow money must learn the rulings that Allah, may He be exalted, has prescribed with regard to lending and borrowing. The one who wants to offer a particular prayer must learn the rulings that Allah, may He be exalted, has prescribed for that prayer. The same applies to purification and all other words and deeds.""(Al-Furuq\xa02/275).\nAl-Bukhari (2964) narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said:\n… One of you will be fine so long as he fears Allah. If he has any doubt about something, he should ask a man who will give him an answer.\nIbn al-Mulaqqin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nRegarding his words “If he has any doubt about something, he should ask a man who will give him an answer,” what he means is that part of fearing Allah is not doing anything that you are unsure of until you ask someone who has knowledge about that, so that he can give you an answer regarding it.""(At-Tawdih\xa0 18/81).\nAsh-Shatibi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If one who follows a scholar is faced with some religious issue, he has no option but to ask about it, and that is the general ruling, because Allah did not ask the people to worship Him on the basis of ignorance; rather He asked them to worship Him on the basis of the verse in which He, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning): {So fear Allah, for it is Allah Who teaches you} [al-Baqarah 2:282]. It is not in the way in which many people interpret this verse; rather, according to the understanding of leading scholars of Arabic language, it means: Allah will teach you about whatever issue you are faced with, so fear Him. It is as if the second thing mentioned (teaching) will lead to the first thing mentioned (taqwa or fear of Allah). So the issue of taqwa (fear of Allah) is connected to the condition, which is that you should acquire knowledge. This means that knowledge comes before actions. There is a great deal of evidence to support this meaning, and this is a matter concerning which there is no dispute among the scholars, so there is no need to discuss it at length.""(Al-Muwafaqat\xa0 5/283).\nSecondly:\nIf someone is required to ask and learn, but he fails to ask about what he is not sure of with regard to his religion by way of negligence, laziness and following whims and desires, then he is undoubtedly being heedless about his religion and exposing himself to punishment.\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe one who is able to ask, seek guidance and learn about the truth, but he fails to do that because he is preoccupied with worldly matters, pursuit of leadership, seeking pleasure, making money and so on, is heedless and deserves the punishment, and he is sinning by neglecting what is required of him, which is fearing Allah as much as he can. The ruling in his case is the same ruling as that on others like him who neglect some obligatory duties.""(At-Turuq al-Hukmiyyah\xa0 1/465).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhat is required of the individual is not to delay asking people of knowledge, because the more he delays asking, the more he will increase in sin, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{So [O people] ask those who have knowledge, if you do not know}\xa0[an-Nahl 16:43].\nSo what the individual must do is ask first, before taking action. If it so happens that he acts, then becomes uncertain, then he must hasten to ask.""(Fatawa Nur ‘ala ad-Darb\xa08/315).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/357385/what-is-the-ruling-on-going-ahead-and-doing-something-without-asking-about-the-ruling-on-it
45684,"We are from Jeddah and after Hajj, some of those who were with us said that the people of Jeddah do not have to do the Farewell Tawaf. What should we do?","[""Praise be to Allah.Is Farewell Tawaf compulsory?\xa0\nThe Farewell Tawaf is obligatory for the one who wants to leave Makkah after completing the rituals of Hajj, because Al-Bukhari (1755) and Muslim (1328) narrated that Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The people were commanded that the last thing they should do should be to circumambulate the House, but this was waived in the case of menstruating women.\xa0\nAl-Hafidh (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Fat-h:\xa0\n“This indicates that the Farewell Tawaf is obligatory, because the command is confirmed and because it is waived in the case of menstruating women; and a thing can only be waived if it is first confirmed.”\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said something similar in Sharh Muslim.\xa0\nThe scholars differed concerning those for whom the Farewell Tawaf is obligatory. Some of them said that it is obligatory for the one who is going to travel and pass the Miqat, but for those who live within the Miqat, the Farewell Tawaf is not obligatory.\xa0 (See Radd Al-Muhtar, 3/545)\nOthers were of the view that it is obligatory for anyone who is going to travel the distance at which it becomes permissible to shorten the prayers (approximately 80 kilometres), but for those who are travelling a shorter distance, it is not obligatory. Ash-Shafi`i and Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on them) were of the view that it is obligatory for everyone who is going to travel from Makkah and exit the city.\xa0\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Majmu` (8/236):\xa0\n“We narrated from Al-Baghawi that the Farewell Tawaf is required of everyone who wants to leave Makkah and travel the distance at which it becomes permissible to shorten the prayers. He said: if a person wants to travel for less than that distance, he does not have to do the Farewell Tawaf. But the correct and well known view is that it is required of the one who wants to travel the distance at which it becomes permissible to shorten the prayers or less, whether that is a short or long distance, because of the general meaning of the Hadith.”\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Mughni (5/337):\xa0\n“If a person's home is in the Haram, then he is like a Makkan and does not have to do the Farewell Tawaf . If a person's home is outside the Haram, but close to it, then the apparent meaning of Al-Khuraqi`s words is that he should not depart until he has bid Farewell to the House. This is the view of Abu Thawr and is similar to what Malik said, and is based on the general meaning of the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “No one should leave until the last thing he has done is to circumambulate the House.” And because he is leaving Makkah, he must bid Farewell, like one who lives far away.” End quote.\xa0\nIs the Farewell Tawaf Obligatory for the People of Jeddah?\nThe view that the people of Jeddah do not have to do the Farewell Tawaf was stated by some scholars, but the correct view is that it is obligatory for them. Based on that, those who did not do it have to offer a sacrifice (a sheep or one-seventh of a cow) to be slaughtered in Makkah and its meat distributed among the poor of the Haram. The same applies to everyone who omitted one of the obligatory parts of the Hajj rituals.\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Whoever lives in Jeddah must not leave Makkah until he has bid Farewell.” (Majmu` Fatawa Ibn `Uthaymin, 23/353)\xa0\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about some people from Jeddah who did not do the Farewell Tawaf and went back to Jeddah.\xa0\nHe replied:\xa0\n“Their Hajj is valid, but they have done wrong by omitting to bid Farewell, because the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded the pilgrim to bid Farewell, and said: \xa0“No one should leave until the last thing he has done is to circumambulate the House.”\xa0\xa0\nThis command, which is addressed to the pilgrims, includes the people of Jeddah and others. So all the people from other cities – whether they come from Jeddah or At-Ta`if or anywhere else – should bid Farewell to the House.\nSome scholars granted a dispensation to those whose homes are closer than the distance at which is becomes permissible to shorten the prayers, such as the people of Bahrah etc, and said that they do not have to bid Farewell, but in order to be on the safe side, everyone who comes from outside the sanctuary should bid Farewell when his Hajj is over. The people of Jeddah live far away, as do the people of At-Ta`if, so they should bid Farewell before they leave, because the Hadith applies to them too. They should offer a sacrifice to be slaughtered in Makkah for each of them who did not do the Farewell Tawaf , the meat of which should be distributed to the poor, a sheep or one-seventh of a camel or one-seventh of a cow” (Majmu` Fatawa Ibn Baz, 17/394)\nIt says in Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 11/303:\xa0\n“If you do Hajj then you should not travel to Jeddah after your Hajj until you have done the Farewell Tawaf; if you travel before bidding Farewell, then you have to offer a sacrifice to be slaughtered in Makkah, from which you should not eat, rather it should be distributed to the poor, because the Farewell Tawaf is obligatory after Hajj, because of the general meaning of the Hadith of Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him), who commanded the people that the last thing they should do should be to circumambulate the House, but this was waived in the case of menstruating women. (Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim) And you also have to repent to Allah for going out to Jeddah before doing the Farewell Tawaf.”\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45684/is-the-farewell-tawaf-obligatory-for-the-people-of-jeddah
