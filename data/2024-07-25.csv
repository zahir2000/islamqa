247636,“Daughters are good deeds and sons are blessings; good deeds will be rewarded and blessings will be asked about” – how sound is this hadith and what does it mean?,"['Praise be to Allah.These words are not known to be narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) or from any of his companions. Rather they were quoted by some of the scholars from some of the early generations.\nAbu Mansur ath-Tha‘alibi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Durar al-Hukam (p. 24):\nJa‘far ibn Muhammad said: “Daughters are good deeds and sons are blessings; good deeds will be rewarded and blessings will be asked about.”\nThe Shi‘ah often quote these words in their books and attribute them to Ja‘far ibn Muhammad (may Allah have mercy on him), but what they mention in their books cannot be quoted as evidence, because they tell lies about Allah and His Messenger, and they tell lies about the early generations of this ummah.\nIbn ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Bahjat al-Majalis (p. 162):\nMuhammad ibn Sulayman said: Sons are a blessing and daughters are good deeds, and Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will bring people to account for blessings and will reward them for good deeds.\nSomething similar was mentioned by Ibn Muflih (may Allah have mercy on him) in al-Adab ash-Shar‘iyyah (1/454), quoting from Muhammad ibn Sulayman.\nSons and daughters are both blessings that Allah, may He be exalted, bestows on people, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{He bestows female [offspring] upon whomever He wills, and bestows male [offspring] upon whomever He wills,\nor He bestows both males and females; and He leaves barren whomever He wills. Verily, He is All-Knowing, Omnipotent}\xa0[ash-Shura 42:49-50].\nIt may be that what is meant by the one who said that is that the blessing of sons is greater and more perfect.\nBut there are a number of hadiths which speak of the virtue of raising daughters, such as that in which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Anyone who is tested with daughters and treats them kindly, they will be a shield for him against the Fire.”\nAnd he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever takes care of two girls until they reach puberty, he and I will come like this on the Day of Resurrection” – and he held his two fingers together. Narrated by Muslim (2631).\nThe criterion to determine which is better is not gender; rather the criterion is righteousness, and joy is to be found in having righteous offspring.\nA daughter may be better for her parents in this world and the hereafter than a son, or it may be the other way round.\nSons and daughters are both blessings, and they both come under the heading of good deeds, if Allah blesses them.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/247636/daughters-are-good-deeds-and-sons-are-blessings-good-deeds-will-be-rewarded-and-blessings-will-be-asked-about-how-sound-is-this-hadith-and-what-does-it-mean
139953,"The two Angels, who write our lives in a book (good and bad things) , don't come to the house with a picture? When I pray and there is a picture. I must give Salam to the angels(Taslim) and the angels aren't here, because there are pictures in the house?","['Praise be to Allah.Do recording Angels enter a house with pictures?\nYes, the recording angels who write down the deeds of the son of Adam enter houses in which there are images.\xa0\nDo Angels of mercy enter a house with pictures?\xa0\nWhat is meant by the angels who do not enter a house in which there are images are the angels of mercy.\xa0\nAl-Bukhari (3226) and Muslim (2106) narrated from Abu Talhah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said; “The angels do not enter a house in which there is an image.”\xa0\nWhy\xa0 don’t the angels of mercy enter a house with pictures\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“The scholars said: The reason why they do not enter a house in which there is an image is because it is a grievous sin, and it is competing with the creation of Allah, may He be exalted, and some of them are images of things that are worshipped instead of Allah, may He be exalted.\xa0\nWith regard to these angels who do not enter a house in which there is a dog or an image, they are the angels who go round with mercy, blessings and prayers for forgiveness. With regard to the recording angels, they enter every house and never leave the sons of Adam under any circumstances, because they are enjoined to list and record their deeds .” (Sharh Muslim, 14/84)\nIt says in Tuhfat Al-Ahwadhi (8/72): \xa0\n“The words “the angels do not enter” mean: the angels of mercy, not the recording angels or the Angels of death.”\xa0\nIbn Al-Athir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“What is meant is the angels who travel about and not the recording angels and those who are present at the time of death.” (An-Nihayah, 4/789)\nAs-Suyuti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Al-Khattabi said: What is meant is the angels who bring mercy and blessings, not the recording angels.” (Sharh An-Nasa’i, 1/141)\nShaykh Muhammad ibn Ibrahim (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Are his words “The angels do not enter a house in which there is an image or a dog” general in meaning and do they include the recording angels or not?\xa0\nHe replied: “It seems that they are not included in this.” (Fatawa wa Rasa’il Muhammad ibn Ibrahim, 1/169)\xa0\nWhat are the images that prevent angels from entering a house?\nThe images which prevent the angels from entering a house are images of animate beings, apart from images that are dealt with in a disrespectful manner.\xa0\nAl-Khattabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“The angels do not enter a house in which there is a dog or an image that it is forbidden to keep. With regard to that which it is not forbidden to keep, such as a dog for hunting, farming or guarding livestock, or images that are not dealt with in a respectful manner (such as) those on carpets, pillows and the like, the angels are not prevented from entering because of them.” (Tuhfat Al-Ahwadhi, 8/72)\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin said: “If the images are treated without respect, such as images on carpets or pillows, the majority of scholars are of the view that they are permissible. Based on that, the angels are not prevented from entering that place, because if they were prevented that would be not allowed.” (Liqa’ Al-Bab Al-Maftuh, 85/6)\xa0\nCan you pray in a place where there is an image?\nWith regard to praying in a place where there is an image, it is not permissible, unless the Muslim is forced to pray in that place and is not able to remove the image.\xa0\nThe scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas said:\xa0\n“Praying in places where these images are is not permissible except in cases of necessity. The same applies to praying in clothes on which there are images of animals; it is not permissible, but if he does it, his prayer is sound but he is committing a forbidden action.” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 1/705)\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/139953/do-recording-angels-enter-a-house-with-pictures
509169,"My sister’s husband is foul-mouthed; he reviles and berates her in the worst of phrases, beats her and always threatens to kill her and threatens to harm my older brother for no reason. He causes trouble for no reason, like one who is mentally disturbed. Please note that she is the one who spends on him and on the house, as she pays for rent, food and clothing. She has five children, and he is unemployed; he does not want to work even though he is in good health. Is it permissible to advise her to seek a divorce from him, because she fears for her life and the life of her children, or does this come under the heading of creating troubles between spouses?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIf the situation is as described in the question, undoubtedly this is one of the troubles of life. It is not appropriate for a man whom Allah has enjoined to be in charge of his household, spend on them and shoulder the responsibility of raising his children to be like this. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Each of you is in a position of responsibility and each of you is answerable for those under his care. A man is in a position of responsibility over his household and is answerable for those under his care. A woman is in a position of responsibility over her husband’s house and children and is answerable for those under her care. Indeed, each of you is in a position of responsibility and each of you is answerable for those under his care.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (2278).\nIt is well known that the woman has the right to ask for divorce (talaq) or khul‘ if there is a reason for that. It was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the wife of Thabit ibn Qays came to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and said: “O Messenger of Allah, I do not find any fault with Thaabit ibn Qays in his character or his religious commitment, but I do not want to commit any act of disbelief after becoming a Muslim.” The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to her, “Will you give back his garden [that he had given to her as the mahr]?” She said, “Yes.” So the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to Thaabit: “Take back your garden, and divorce her.”\xa0\nWhat is meant by her words “but I do not want to commit any act of disbelief after becoming a Muslim” is: I do not want to do any actions that are contrary to the rulings of Islam, such as despising my husband, disobeying him, not fulfilling his rights, and so on.\nSee: Fath al-Bari (9/400).\nShaykh Ibn Jibrin (may Allah have mercy on him) said, explaining what justifies seeking khul‘:\nIf the woman dislikes her husband’s characteristics, such as if he is harsh, strict, short-tempered, filled with anger, criticizes the slightest action and rebukes her for the slightest shortcoming, then she has the right to seek khul‘.\nSecondly: if she dislikes his appearance, such as a flaw, a defect, or a deficiency in his senses, then she has the right to seek khul‘.\nThirdly: if he is lacking in religious commitment, such as if he does not pray or is careless about attending prayers in congregation, or he breaks the fast of Ramadan with no excuse, or he goes to places where haram activities take place, such as zina, drinking, listening to music and entertainment, and the like, then she has the right to seek khul‘.\nFourthly: If he deprives her of her rights, such as maintenance, clothing or essential needs, when he is able to provide those things, then she has the right to seek khul‘.\nFifthly: If he does not give her her right to regular intimacy in a way that will keep her chaste because he is impotent, or has no interest in her, or he prefers someone else, or he is not fair in sharing his time [among co-wives], then she has the right to seek khul‘. And Allah knows best. End quote.\nSee also the answer to question no. 1859 .\nSecondly:\nAs your sister is the one who is in charge, and she knows her husband’s condition better than anyone, she is the one who should decide whether it is better to stay with him for the sake of the children despite these annoyances, because the presence of the father and the sense of family unity has a positive psychological impact on the children, gives them a good social standing and it helps in giving them a good upbringing, and in many cases it is better than separation.\nWe should also note that our advice should differ, depending on whether the couple have children or not. Making sacrifices for the sake of the children’s safety, their social standing, their psychological wellbeing and sense of family is worth patience and sacrifice.\nShe should also persist in calling upon Allah, asking Him to rectify his condition, and she should ask sincere and knowledgeable people to advise him. For hearts fluctuate, and they are in the hand of Allah. How many people have come back to their senses and settled down after having gone astray and misbehaved.\nIf there is anyone among his family and relatives who is rational and mature in thinking, and is held in high esteem by him and can influence him, then she can seek his help to influence him and tell him about his situation, if there is the hope that this will help to rectify his condition.\nWhat appears to us to be the case is that if your sister shows patience, which is indicative of her rational mind and far-sightedness, no one should interfere by advising her to leave him, which could cause greater harm than the harm that results from her staying with this husband despite the problems he has.\nBut if she fears for her life, her faith or her children, then let her do that; there is nothing wrong with her seeking separation from him in that case.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/509169/my-sister-is-suffering-because-of-her-husband-can-i-advise-her-to-seek-a-divorce
