223445,"I was unaware of the Islamic rulings when I went in to have a vasectomy. What should I do now? In other words, what are the guidelines?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly: it is not permissible for a man or woman to undergo any surgical or other procedure that will permanently prevent them from having children.\nOne of these means that is forbidden is vasectomy, which is a surgical procedure in which the vas deferens (the two channels through which sperm travels to the bladder and then to the penis) is cut.\nIt says in a statement of the Islamic Fiqh Council: It is haram to permanently remove the ability to produce offspring for a man or a woman, which is what is known as sterilization, so long as there is no necessary reason, according to Islamic standards, for doing that.\nThis has been explained previously in the answers to questions no. 111969 and 47196 .\nSecondly: With regard to reversing the vasectomy, this is a matter concerning which one must refer to medical specialists. If the doctors determine that there is no harm that would result from that, then you must undergo this procedure and restore the vas deferens to its natural state.\nBut if that is not possible, or it will result in harm, then you do not have to do anything, because harm cannot be removed by further harm.\nAs you did that as a result of ignorance of the ruling, then Allah, may He be exalted, will pardon you and there is no sin on you. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {And there is no blame upon you for that in which you have erred but [only for] what your hearts intended} [al-Ahzaab 33:5].\nAnd you did not deliberately intend to commit sin.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/223445/ruling-on-vasectomy-and-reversal-thereof
223462,What is the ruling on a sister kissing her brothers in public places?,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThere is nothing wrong with a man kissing his mahram – his paternal aunt, maternal aunt, mother, grandmother or sister – and that should be on the head, on the nose or on the cheek, according to what is customary among the people. The majority of scholars regarded it as makruh (disapproved) to kiss anyone on the mouth except the husband.\nSimilarly, there is nothing wrong with his mahram – such as his sister, paternal aunt or maternal aunt – kissing him on his head or cheek. But that should not be a habit that they do regularly; rather it should only be when he returns from a journey and the like. As for them taking kissing as a regular habit, that is not appropriate according to Islamic teachings.\nIt is also stipulated that both parties should be safe from fitnah (temptation).\nIbn Mansur asked Imam Ahmad: Can a man kiss his mahrams? He said: If he has returned from a journey and does not fear any fitnah from that, and he quoted the hadith of Khalid ibn al-Walid, according to which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) returned from a military campaign and kissed Fatimah (may Allah be pleased with her).""(Al-Furu‘\xa0\xa08/191).\nSee also the answer to question number 130002 .\nSecondly:\nWith regard to kissing them in public places in front of other people, that is not appropriate, because it is improper and undignified. The scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) stated that it is makruh (disliked) for a husband to kiss his wife in front of people, because it is contrary to the decency and dignity that the Muslim should observe.\nIf that is in a public place where the people do not know that she is his sister or one of his mahrams, then it is even more disliked, because it opens the door to people thinking ill of them.\nThere may be a concession allowing that if it is in particular circumstances and there are other signs which indicate that this is a man kissing his sister or one of his mahrams, such as if that happens at an airport or port when people are bidding farewell to a traveller or welcoming one who has returned, and if the man or woman are old.\nOr if they both appear to be people of modesty, good manners and religious commitment, in which case the kiss would not lead the onlooker to think ill of them and it would not offend public decency, so it is not far-fetched to suggest that a concession may be allowed in that case.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/223462/what-is-the-ruling-on-a-sister-kissing-her-brothers-in-public-places
