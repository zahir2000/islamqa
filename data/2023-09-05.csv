81427,What should be said after the mu’adhdhin says “As-salatu khayrun min an-nawm (prayer is better than sleep)”? Please provide evidence for that. May Allah reward you with good.,"['Praise be to Allah.It is recommended (mustahabb) for the one who hears the adhan to say what the mu’adhdhin says, except when he says “Hayya ‘ala as-salah (come to prayer)” and “Hayya ‘ala al-falah (come to success),” in which case it is recommended to say, “La hawla wa la quwwata illa Billah (There is no power and no strength except with Allah).”\nThe evidence for that is the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him):\n“When you hear the mu’adhdhin, say what he says.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (611) and Muslim (318).\nIbn Qudamah said in al-Mughni (1/591):\nI do not know of any difference of opinion among the scholars regarding the fact that this is recommended. End quote.\nThat includes when the mu’adhdhin says in the call to Fajr prayer: “As-salatu khayrun min an-nawm (prayer is better than sleep).” In this case it is recommended for the one who hears it to repeat the same, so he should say, “As-salatu khayrun min an-nawm.”\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said in ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘ (2/84):\nThe correct view is that he should say the same as the mu’adhdhin says, “(prayer As-salatu khayrun min an-nawm,” because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When you hear the mu’adhdhin, say what he says.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (611) and Muslim (318).\nThis was the view of some of the Maliki jurists. See: al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 2/372.\nWith regard to what some jurists regarded as recommended, which is to say, “Sadaqta wa bararta (you have spoken the truth and done well),” there is no evidence for that and it is contrary to the general meaning of the hadith quoted above, “say what he says.” The basic principle is that acts of worship are disallowed unless evidence for them is proven.\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said in at-Talkhis al-Habir (1/378):\nThere is no basis for what is mentioned about the response to “As-salatu khayrun min an-nawm (prayer is better than sleep).” End quote.\nAs-San‘ani (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Subul as-Salaam (1/190):\nIt was said that in response to the phrase “As-salatu khayrun min an-nawm,” one should say, “Sadaqta wa bararta (you have spoken the truth and done well).” This is something that is thought to be a good idea by those who say it, but there is no sound report from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to prove that. End quote.\nShaykh Muhammad ibn Ibrahim said in Majmu‘ al-Fatawa (2/no. 448):\nThe words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), “say what he says,” indicate that one should repeat, “As-salatu khayrun min an-nawm (prayer is better than sleep).” As for saying, “Sadaqta wa bararta (you have spoken the truth and done well),” that is only mentioned in a weak (da‘if) hadith. Hence the one who wants to say something you should choose to say, “As-salatu khayrun min an-nawm.” The correct view – and Allah knows best – is that he should not respond by saying, “Sadaqta wa bararta.” I hear some people combining the two phrases, so they say, “As-salatu khayrun min an-nawm; sadaqta wa bararta (prayer is better than sleep; you have spoken the truth and done well).” But there is no basis for that; rather it is better to look at the evidence.

457296,"I often forget the adhkar which are to be said at specific times, such as the dhikr for entering or exiting the mosque, or before and after Wudu, or when getting into the car, so I say them when I remember them. So if I enter the mosque and I forget the du`a, then I say it when I am inside, or when I exit the house and I say the du`a when I am outside, so that I will be protected from all directions and in all places, and so that I get used to reciting dhikr and do not forget it, will I attain the reward for that, and will I be protected from all ills?","['Praise be to Allah.With regard to the adhkar that are connected to specific reasons, if the Muslim forgets to say them, then remembers them, either he remembers it after the reason for it is gone, or he remembers it before that.\nIf he remembers it before the reason for it is gone, such as the dhikr for getting onto a mount or into a car, if he remembers it when he is still on his mount or in his car, then it is recommended for him to say the dhikr, because the reason for it is still there.\nBut if he remembers it after the reason for it has gone, then the opportunity to recite this dhikr has been missed because the reason for it is gone.\nIbn ‘Allan (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWith regard to the adhkar that are connected to specific reasons, such as the dhikr for seeing the new moon, or hearing thunder, and the like, it is not recommended to make them up when the reason for them is gone. Even though I do not know any scholar who mentioned this ruling, the jurists have stated something which may indicate that, such as when they said concerning the [nafil] prayer that is offered for a reason, such as greeting the mosque, that it is not recommended to make it up if the reason for it is no longer there, in contrast to the five daily prayers.""(Al-Futuhat ar-Rabbaniyyah\xa0 1/149).\nThis applies to every nafil act of worship that is done for a specific reason; these acts are not to be made up if the reason for them is gone.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nNafil acts of worship are of two types: one for which there is a specific reason and one for which there is no specific reason.\nThat for which there is a reason is no longer required once the reason for it is gone, and it is not to be made up. One example of that is the prayer to greet the mosque. If a man comes and sits down and remains seated for a long time, then he wants to offer the prayer to greet the mosque, it will not count as greeting the mosque, because that is a prayer that is done for a reason and is connected to a reason, and once that reason is gone, that prayer is no longer prescribed.\nAnother example, as seems to be the case, is the days of ‘Arafah and \'Ashura. If someone delays fasting on the day of ‘Arafah or the day of \'Ashura, with no excuse, then there is no doubt that it cannot be made up and he will not benefit if he does make it up, meaning that he will not attain the same reward as one who fasted on the actual day of ‘Arafah or \'Ashura.\nBut if that day came and he had an excuse for not fasting – such as a woman who is menstruating or bleeding following childbirth, or someone who is sick – \xa0then what appears to be the case is that he does not have to make it up, because that fast is specified for a particular day, and the ruling no longer applies once this day is over.""(Majmu‘ Fatawa wa Rasa’il ash-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin\xa0 20/43).\nBut even if the Muslim misses specific adhkar such as these, he can make up for it by reciting any general dhikr or du‘a’, because they are among the greatest means by which a person may protect himself from harm in all situations.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/457296/if-someone-forgets-the-adkhar-that-are-to-be-recited-for-specific-reasons-can-he-say-them-when-he-remembers-them
