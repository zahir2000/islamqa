Every time there is any talk about the jinn, my heart almost leaves my chest and I go into a severe panic, especially","['Praise be to Allah.What you must do is gain courage by remembering Allah and always obeying Him. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {Those who have believed and whose hearts are assured by the remembrance of Allah. Unquestionably, by the remembrance of Allah hearts are assured} [ar-Ra‘d 13:28].\nSo fortify yourself with remembrance of Allah, especially the adhkar that are to be recited morning and evening, and the adhkar that are to be recited when going to sleep and when entering the bathroom. And recite Surat al-Baqarah often in your house, for the Shaytan flees from the house in which Surat al-Baqarah is recited.\nYou should understand that the scheme of the Shaytan is weak, and he is much more insignificant than you think. In fact, Allah has limited his scheming to whispers (waswasah), so when you are afraid of something, seek help against it by remembering Allah and turning to Him, for He is the best protector.\nIt was narrated that ‘Uthman ibn ‘Affan (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said:\n“There is no one who says every morning and every evening ‘Bismillah illadhi la yadurru ma‘a ismihi shay’un fi’l-ardi wa la fi’s-sama’ wa huwa as-sami‘ al-‘alim (In the Name of Allah, with whose name nothing on earth or in heaven can cause harm, and He is the All-Hearing, All-Knowing)’ three times, but nothing will harm him.”\nIt is a sahih hadith which was narrated by at-Tirmidhi (3388), who said: A sahih hasah hadith; it was also classed as sahih by al-Albani.\nIt was narrated from Khawlah bint Hakeem as-Sulamiyyah that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever makes a stop on a journey and says, ‘A‘udhu bi kalimat Allah il-tammati min sharri ma khalaqa (I seek refuge in the perfect words of Allah from the evil of that which He has created),’ nothing will harm him until he moves on from that place.”\xa0Narrated by Muslim, 2708 and others.\nA man asked ‘Abd ar-Rahman ibn Khanbash: What did the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) do when the devils schemed against him?\nJibril (peace be upon him) taught the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to seek refuge with Allah from the evil of the devils and the rebellious jinn by saying:\nA‘udhu bi kalimat illah it-tammat illatī la yujawizuhunna barrun wa la fajirun min sharri ma khalaq, wa dhara\'a wa bara\'a, wa min sharri ma yanzilu min as-sama\', wa min sharri ma ya‘ruju fīha, wa min sharri ma dhara\'a fi’l-arḍ, wa min sharri ma yakhruju minha, wa min sharri fitan il-layli wa’n-nahar, wa min sharri kulli tariqin illa tariqan yatruqu bikhayrin ya Rahman (I seek refuge in the Perfect Words of Allah, which neither the righteous nor the evil may overcome, from the evil of what He created, of what He scattered and what He made, from the evil of what descends from the heavens, and of what ascends to them, from the evil of what He scattered in the earth, and of what emerges from it, from the evil trials of night and day, and from the evil of every night visitor, except the night visitor who comes with good, O Merciful Gracious).\nA sahih hadith, narrated by Ahmad (15035) and others; classed as sahih by al-Albani.\nIt was narrated by ‘Abdullah ibn Khubayb that his father said: I was with the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on the road to Makkah, and I had the opportunity to be alone with the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). I draw close to him and he said: “Speak.”\nI said: What should I say?\nHe said: “Speak.”\nI said: What should I say?\nHe said: “Say: {Qul a‘udhu bi rabbi l falaq (Say, ""I seek refuge in the Lord of daybreak)} until you complete the surah, then say {Qul a‘udhu bi Rabb in-nas (Say, ""I seek refuge in the Lord of mankind)} until you complete the surah.” Then he said: “The people will not seek refuge with Allah with anything better than these two.”\nA sahih hadith, narrated by an-Nasa’i (5429) and others; classed as sahih by al-Albani.\nYou should be careful lest the Shaytan prevent you from doing acts of worship or praying in congregation by scaring you and making you afraid. For all that he wants is to prevent you from praying in congregation, then Allah knows best what else he could lead you to of evil or prevent you from doing of good after that.\nMay Allah make you steadfast, give you courage, reassure you and avert from you the schemes, temptations and whispers of the Shaytan.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/222910/he-is-afraid-of-the-dark-because-he-is-terrified-of-the-jinn-how-can-he-rid-himself-of-this-fear
111881,What is the reason why divorce is in the husband’s hands? What is the ruling on one who divorces his wife for no reason?,"[""Praise be to Allah.Why Is Divorce in the Husband's Hands?\nShaykh Muhammad ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“The reason why divorce is in the man’s hand is justice because the husband is the one in whose hand is the marriage contract, so he is the one in whose hand is the dissolution of this contract.\xa0\nAnd because the husband is in charge of the woman, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allah has made one of them to excel the other”\xa0[al-Nisa’ 4:34].\xa0\nAs he is in charge, then the matter is in his hands. This is what is implied by common sense. \xa0\nAnd because the man is more perfect in reason than the woman, and more far-sighted, so you do not see him choosing to divorce unless he sees that there is no alternative. But if it were in the wife’s hand, the wife is lacking in reason and is less far-sighted, and she is quick to become emotional. She may be impressed by some man and hasten to divorce her husband, because she has seen someone who is more attractive to her, so she prefers him to her husband. There are other reasons, but these three reasons that I have mentioned are among the most important reasons why divorce is in the husband’s hands.”\xa0\nCan a man divorce his wife for any reason?\nShaykh Muhammad ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) also said:\n“With regard to the ruling on one who divorces his wife for no reason , the scholars say that the five rulings apply to divorce, i.e., it may be obligatory, or it may be prohibited, or it may be recommended, or it may be disliked, or it may be permissible.\xa0\nThe basic principle is that divorce is not desirable, because it is dissolving the bonds of marriage which Islam encourages and promotes, and because a great deal of harm may result from it, such as if the woman has children from the husband – this divorce will result in splitting up of the family and the problems that result from that.\nIf there is a need for divorce because it is not possible for the spouses to live together happily, then in that case it is permissible, and it is a blessing from Allah, I mean it being permissible in that case, because if the couple were to remain in a life of misery and suffering, this world would be unbearable for them. But by the blessing of Allah, if there is a need for it, then it is permissible.”\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/111881/why-is-divorce-in-the-husbands-hands
175964,"I suffer from perfectionism, and I realized recently that perfectionists are the ones who procrastinate the most, because of this condition. I have also experienced that myself. I want to rid myself of procrastination because it comes from the Shaytan. Praise be to Allah, I do not procrastinate in matters having to do with religion, but I do that in other matters. I would like you to give me some advice that will enable me to rid myself of perfectionism and thus be able to resist procrastinating. I hope that you can help.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe Muslim’s striving for perfection in his attitude, worship and interactions with people is a good thing, and his efforts to attain that are efforts aimed at attaining sublime goals. But this perfectionism may conflict with the real-life situation in which the Muslim lives, and that may lead to frustration. Moreover, he may find himself weak in some aspects, so he gives up on goodness altogether. Therefore there is nothing better than moderation in all things and striving to do one’s best. This is the advice that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) gave to his ummah when he said: “Do your best, but do not go to extremes; pray during the forenoon and the afternoon, and during a part of the night; always adopt a moderate course and you will reach your goal.” \xa0Narrated by al-Bukhari (6098). See a commentary on this hadith in the answer the question no. 70314 .\nHence one of the most important things that the Muslim should do in order to ward off perfectionism is being realistic. So he should not go to extremes in attempting to do that which he may not be able to do, or he may not be able to continue doing, which would cause him to become frustrated, and that in turn would lead to him giving up striving for what is best.\nAmong the things that are said by specialists who treat your condition of perfectionism are the following:\n1. You should set realistic goals that are possible to achieve and give up perfectionism which may prevent you from reaching these goals.\n2. You should not compare yourself to others, and you should convince yourself that each person has his own talents and abilities that suit him. This point may be very important, because there are errors that many people make in raising their children when they are small, as they raise them to be perfectionists with regard to their study grades, so the children try to please their parents for fear of failure. Thus perfectionism becomes deeply rooted, which causes anxiety when a person experiences reality and sees it with his own eyes.\n3. You should not fear criticism from other people when you are striving to change, improve yourself and live your real life.\n4. Finally, there is nothing wrong with going to see a trustworthy specialist psychologist. Perhaps if he listens to you and you talk to him, he may be able to treat your condition, by Allah’s leave.\nSecondly:\nWith regard to dealing with procrastination – which refers to delaying things and putting them off – it may be dealt with in several ways, including the following:\n1. Deciding to be firm and have strong resolve, and deciding to work hard today so that you may rest tomorrow, is better than resting today and having to strive hard tomorrow.\n2. Reminding yourself constantly that procrastination stems from helplessness and weakness, and helplessness and weakness are not characteristics of the Muslim. Rather if a person is proud of being human, he would not like to have these characteristics.\n3. Constantly calling upon Allah in supplication and beseeching Him to free you from helplessness and laziness.\n4. Keeping away from lazy people and procrastinators, and keeping company with people of resolve, determination and strength, for that will lead you to strive against your nafs and become a person of resolve, determination and strength.\n5. Learning from the early generations and the way in which they viewed procrastination and had a strong aversion towards it, which led them to keep away from it in word and deed, and in their thoughts and behaviour.\nThe caliph ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Part of strength is not to put off today’s work until tomorrow.""(Afat ‘ala at-Tariq by Shaykh Sayyid Nuh).\nWe ask Allah, may He be exalted, to help and guide you to do that which pleases Him, and to make you among those who are serious and obedient to Him.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/175964/she-suffers-from-perfectionism-which-leads-to-procrastination
