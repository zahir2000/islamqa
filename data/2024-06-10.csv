237593,"How can I differ from the Jews on the days that they venerate? Is that done by fasting, because fasting means that the day is not a festival (eid)? Or is it by not fasting and not aiming to fast on that day? Regarding the first idea, there is the hadith of Umm Salamah: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to fast on Saturdays and Sundays more than on other days, and he would say: “They are two festival days (eids) of the polytheists, and I like to differ from them.” And regarding the second idea, the scholars give as the reason for that the fact that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade fasting on Saturdays.","['Praise be to Allah.What is known from the teachings of Islam, in which the texts of the Quran and Sunnah were narrated via many chains of narration, is that it is not permissible to imitate the disbelieving nations in what is unique to them of actions, beliefs, words and appearance.\nIt is well known that not imitating them may be achieved by not following them and not doing things that are uniquely theirs.\nThat includes their festivals, so differing from them and not imitating them may be achieved simply by not venerating those festivals and not celebrating them. If the Muslim achieves that and ignores celebrating those days, or avoids singling them out for some activities, then in that case he will have managed to differ from them.\nIt was narrated in the hadith of Anas: When the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came to Madinah, they had two days on which they used to play. He said: “What are these two days?” They said: We used to play on these days during the Jahiliyyah. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has replaced them for you with something better than them: the Day of [Eid] al-Adha and the day of [Eid] al-Fitr.” Narrated by Abu Dawud (1134); classed as sahih by al-Albani in as-Silsilah as-Sahihah (2021).\nThus the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed them to give up celebrating those two days as festivals, but he did not instruct them to do anything more than that, such as fasting and the like, in order to differ from the polytheists.\nAsh-Shatibi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe second type is matters in which the Lawgiver did not give a specific ruling, or overlooked some matters where there is a reason now, and there was a reason at the time of revelation and afterwards, but no instruction was given in addition to what was there at that time.\nWhen the Lawgiver overlooks such matters, it is like stating that the shar‘i objective concerning that matter should not be extended beyond the general rulings concerning such matters, nor should it be reduced, because when there was a reason [at the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)] to dictate a practical, specific ruling, yet the Lawgiver did not legislate such a ruling or indicate that it should be worked out, this makes it clear that anything additional to what was narrated in the religious texts is an innovation (bid‘ah) that has been added and is contrary to the objectives of the Lawgiver, as it may be understood that the Lawgiver intended that we should stop at that limit and not add anything to it or take anything away from it.""(Al-I‘tisam\xa02/282).\nWhat we may understand from the above is that deliberately fasting to confirm that we are different from them is something that is not prescribed, and a number of scholars have stated that it is disliked (makruh) to do so, because paying attention to it and waiting for that day to come every year in order to fast is a kind of venerating it.\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf it is said: What do you say about fasting on the days of Nowruz, Mahrajan and other festivals of the polytheists?\nThe answer is: Many of the scholars regarded that as disliked (makruh) and most of the companions of Ahmad also thought that it is disliked.\nAhmad said, according to a report narrated by his son ‘Abdullah: Waki‘ told us, from Sufyan, from a man, from Anas and al-Hasan, that they disliked fasting on the days of Nowruz and Mahrajan. ‘Abdullah said: My father said: The man [mentioned in the isnad] is Aban ibn Abi ‘Ayyash. When Ahmad gave this answer to the one who asked him about fasting on these two days, this indicates that this was his favoured view. This is one of the two views narrated by his companions regarding such matters.\nAnd it was said that this was not his favoured view, and the view that he narrated is not to be attributed to him. Most of his companions were of the view that it is disliked, and they gave as the reason for that the fact that these are two days that are venerated by the disbelievers, so singling them out from among other days for fasting means going along with the disbelievers in their veneration of these days, so it is disliked [to fast on those two days], as is also the case with regard to Saturday. The author of al-Mughni said: By analogy with this, the same ruling applies to all the festivals of the disbelievers or any day that they single out for veneration.""(Hashiyat Ibn al-Qayyim ma‘a ‘Awn al-Ma‘bud\xa0 7/52).\nSecondly:\nWith regard to the hadith of Kurayb the freed slave of Ibn ‘Abbaas, in which he says that he heard Umm Salamah say: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to fast on Saturdays and Sundays more than on other days, and he would say: “They are two festival days (eids) of the polytheists, and I like to differ from them.” Narrated by Ahmad in al-Musnad (44/330-331); al-Hakim in al-Mustadrak (1/436) – he said: Its isnad is sahih, and adh-Dhahabi did not comment on it.\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Zad al-Ma‘ad (2/74-75): There are some reservations about the soundness of this hadith.\nAl-Albani classed it as da‘if (weak) in Silsilat al-Ahadith ad-Da‘ifah (3/219).\nHence we may note the following:\n1.. There is a difference of scholarly opinion as to the soundness of this hadith. It also contradicts another hadith concerning the soundness of which the scholars differed. It is the hadith which says that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not fast on Saturdays except what is obligatory for you.” Narrated by Abu Dawud (2421), at-Tirmidhi (744) and Ibn Majah (1726).\nBecause of this scholarly difference of opinion, this hadith cannot be taken as a basic principle which applies to every festival of the disbelievers.\n2.. Even if we assume that the hadith is sahih, we cannot apply it to all the festivals of the disbelievers, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) lived alongside the Jews in Madinah and alongside Christians and polytheists in the Arabian Peninsula, and undoubtedly they had a number of festivals and days that they venerated throughout the year, but it is not known that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was keen to fast on the days of their festivals (eids) in order to openly differ from them, apart from Saturdays and Sundays.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAny act of worship that was not prescribed, even though there may have been a reason for it to be done and there was no impediment to that, may be understood as being prohibited.""(Iqtida’ as-Sirat al-Mustaqim\xa0 2/721).\n3.. Some of the scholars thought that in order to reconcile between the texts, it may be noted that regarding the festivals of the disbelievers of which the dates are worked out according to the Arabian calendar, it is recommended (mustahabb) to differ from them by fasting on those days, following the hadith of Umm Salamah. As for festivals of which the dates are worked out according to calendars other than the Arabian calendar, it is not recommended to fast on those days.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIt may be said that it is disliked (makruh) to fast on the days of Nowruz and Mahrajan, and similar days of which the dates are not worked out according to the Arabian calendar, in contrast to what is mentioned in the hadith about Saturdays and Sundays, because if a person aims to fast on the days of non-Arab or jahili festivals, that may lead to doing some rituals on those days and reviving them and making them known, in contrast to Saturdays and Sundays, which are known in the Muslim calendar, and there are no negative consequences to fasting on those days. Thus it is recommended (mustahabb) to fast on the days of their festivals that are known according to the Islamic, Arabian calendar, but it is disliked (makruh) to do so with regard to festivals of which the dates are worked out according to non-Arab, jahili calendars, so that we may reconcile between the hadiths. And Allah knows best.""(Iqtida’ as-Sirat al-Mustaqim\xa0 2/580).\nTherefore, according to this view also, it is still disliked (makruh) to fast on the festivals of the disbelievers, apart from Saturdays and Sundays, because the dates of the festivals of the disbelievers that are well known today are not worked out according to the Islamic calendar.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/237593/how-can-i-differ-from-the-jews-on-the-days-that-they-venerate

459431,"My brother and I spend on the household. My father is present but his income is low, and is only sufficient to cover his cigarettes, a few items for the house, water and bread. As for bills, extending our residency permits, expenses and traffic fines, all of that is paid for half-and-half between me and my brother. My aim in contributing is to keep the household running, limit problems, try to stop my brother’s complaints and try to maintain a good standard of living. My question is: my mother has decided to refuse intimacy with my father and not show him any respect, speak any kind word to him or have any relationship with him, on the grounds that he does not spend on her. Does she have the right to do that? Please note that she lacks for nothing and her life is better than it was. Is this regarded as being ungrateful to her husband for kind treatment, because when we were small he used to spend on us, until I reached the age of 19 and my brother reached the age of 23-24? But my mother does not give him any credit for what he already spent.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt is obligatory for a man to spend on his wife, and your father did spend on her when he was able to, for twenty years, as you explained in your question.\nAccording to Islamic teachings, your father is still regarded as spending on your mother, because spending on her has nothing to do with the issue of where he is getting the money from that he spends on her.\nThe other issue is that the sons’ spending on their mother is to be regarded as being like the father spending on her, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “You and your wealth belong to your father.” Ahmad (6902); classed as sahih by al-Albani in al-Irwa’ (1625).\nAnd the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The best food that you eat is what you earn by your own hands, and your children are part of your earnings.” At-Tirmidhi (1358); classed as sahih by al-Albani.\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The father is obliged to spend on his wife, if her children cannot take care of her. But if her children are covering her expenses and they have been covering all her needs, then that is sufficient, because the children are his children too, and his rights over them are great. The Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “You and your wealth belong to your father.” So if they are covering their mother’s needs and spending on her, that is sufficient, praise be to Allah.\nBut if they are not covering her needs, and she is asking for maintenance, she has a choice: if she wishes, she may be patient, or if she wishes, she may say: Divorce me. She may ask for divorce if she cannot be patient, otherwise she should be patient. If her children spend on her and cover her needs, praise be to Allah, and there is no blame on the husband… If his children spend on her, then she has no right to complain or ask her husband to spend on her, because his children’s spending on her is like his spending on her. If they spend on her what is sufficient for her needs, praise be to Allah. If they do not spend on her and he does not spend on her either, then she may ask for divorce. (From the shaykh’s website.)\nBased on that, so long as you and your brother are spending on her and covering her needs, she has no right after that to ask for more maintenance from your father, and he is entitled to all his rights over her in full.\nOnce this is established, then it becomes clear that your mother’s refusing intimacy on the grounds that the father is not spending on her is not permissible, and as a result she is regarded as defiantly disobedient and is sinning.\nShe must fear Allah, for this is a grievous sin. It is soundly narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), as is stated in the hadith of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If a man calls his wife to his bed and she refuses to come, the angels will curse her until morning.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (3065).\nAccording to another hadith, “There is no man who calls his wife to his bed and she refuses, but the One Who is in heaven will be angry with her, until he is pleased with her.” Narrated by Muslim (1436).\nSecondly:\nFrom your question, it seems that your father was not falling short with regard to your mother’s rights or your rights when he was able to spend on you. When his circumstances changed and he was no longer able to spend, your mother forgot his kindness. This is ingratitude towards the husband concerning which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) warned the woman who does that of Hell. According to the hadith, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “I was shown Hell, and I saw that most of its inhabitants are women who are ungrateful (yakfurna).” It was said: Do they disbelieve (yakfurna) in Allah? He said: “They are ungrateful (yakfurna) to their husbands and are ungrateful for kind treatment. If you show kindness to one of them for a lifetime, then she sees something from you, she says: I have never seen anything good from you.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (29).\nIbn Battal (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This refers to the husband. Allah enjoined His Messenger to show gratitude for blessings. It says in the hadith: “He does not thank Allah who does not thank people.” Gratitude for the kindness of the husband comes under the heading of gratitude for the blessings of Allah, because every favour the husband does to his family is a blessing from Allah that He caused to come at his hands.""(Sharh Sahih al-Bukhari by Ibn Battal (1/89).\nWhat the hadith means is that they are denying kind treatment… This indicates that the one who denies the kindness of the one who was kind to him is blameworthy. Al-Karmani said: That is, you [women] deny the kind treatment of the husband and think little of whatever he gives you. We may understand from the warning of hellfire for being ungrateful and cursing a great deal that these are major sins. See: Sharh Ibn Majah by as-Suyuti, et al. (p. 289).\nHence it is important to advise your mother regarding this matter, and tell her that showing kindness to her husband is one of the means of a woman attaining the pleasure of Allah, and is one of the means of her attaining happiness in this world and the hereafter.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/459431/wife-refusing-to-fulfil-her-duties-towards-her-husband-because-he-is-not-spending-on-her
34420,What are the mistakes that some pilgrims make when stoning the Jamarat?,"['Praise be to Allah.Why was stoning the Jamarat prescribed?\nIt was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that he stoned Jamarat Al-`Aqabah which is Al-Jamarah Al-Quswa which is closer to Makkah, with seven pebbles, during the morning of the Day of Sacrifice, saying “Allahu akbar” with every pebble which was a little bigger than a chickpea.\xa0\xa0\nIbn Majah (3029) narrated that Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to me on the morning of Al-`Aqabah when he was standing atop his camel: “Come and pick up for me.” So I picked up pebbles for him which were a little bigger than a chickpea. He put them in his hand and said, “With pebbles like this stone (the Jamarat)… and beware of going to extremes, for those who came before you were destroyed because of going to extremes in religion.” (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah, 2455)\xa0\nAhmad and Abu Dawud narrated from `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Tawaf around the House, [Sa`i] between As-Safa and Al-Marwah and stoning the Jamarat have been prescribed to establish the remembrance of Allah.” This is the reason why the stoning of the Jamarat has been prescribed .\xa0\nMistakes made when stoning the Jamarat\nThere are many mistakes committed by some pilgrims when stoning the Jamarat .\xa0\n\nSome people think that the stoning of the Jamarat is not valid unless it is done with pebbles from Muzdalifah . Hence you will find them going to a lot of trouble to gather the pebbles from Muzdalifah before they go to Mina. This is a mistaken idea, because the pebbles may be taken from anywhere, from Muzdalifah, from Mina, or from any place. The point is that they should be pebbles.\xa0\n\nThere is no report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) picked up the pebbles from Muzdalifah, so that we could say that this is Sunnah. It is not Sunnah, and it is not obligatory to pick up the pebbles from Muzdalifah, because the Sunnah is either the words or actions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), or what he approved of – none of which apply in the case of picking up pebbles from Muzdalifah.\xa0\n\nSome people, when they pick up the pebbles, wash them, either for fear that someone may have urinated on them, or to clean them, because they think that if they are clean, this is better. Whatever the case, washing the pebbles is an innovation (Bid’ah), because the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not do that, and worshipping Allah by doing something that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not do is a kind of bid’ah. If a person does that without the intention of it being an act of worship then it is foolishness and is a waste of time.\xa0\n\n\nSome people think that these Jamarat are devils, and that they are actually stoning devils, so you may see them becoming very emotional and very angry, as if the Shaytan himself is in front of him, and this leads to the following grave errors:\xa0\n\n\nThis is a mistaken notion. We stone these Jamarat as an act of remembering Allah, following the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), as an act of worship. If a person does an act of worship and does not know its benefits, but he does it only as an act of worship for Allah, this will be more indicative of his humility and submission to Allah.\nA person may become very angry and emotional, so you see him disturbing people greatly, as if the people in front of him are vermin and he doesn’t care about them or the weak among them, he just goes forward like a crazy camel.\nA person may not remember that he is worshipping Allah by stoning these Jamarat. Hence he neglects to say the dhikr prescribed in sharee’ah and says words that are not prescribed in shari`ah, such as saying, “O Allah, we are angry with the Shaytan and are pleased with Al-Rahman (the Most Merciful),” even though this is not prescribed when stoning the Jamarat ; rather what is prescribed is to say “Allahu Akbar,” as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to do.\nBased on this false belief you will see some people picking up large rocks and throwing them, because they think that the bigger the rock, the greater the effect and revenge on the Shaytan. You also see them throwing shoes, pieces of wood and the like, which are not prescribed for throwing.\n\nSo if we say that this belief is false, what do we then believe about stoning the Jamarat? We believe that we stone the Jamarat as an act of veneration and worship of Allah, and following the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).\xa0\n\nSome people are careless and do not care whether the pebbles land in the pit around the Jamarat or not .\xa0\n\nIf the pebbles do not land in the pit around the Jamarat, then the stoning is not valid. It is sufficient for the person to think it most likely that the pebbles have landed in the pit around the Jamarat, and it is not essential to be certain, because certainty in this case may not be possible; if one cannot be certain that he should act on what he thinks is most likely. Islam allows a person to proceed on the basis of what he thinks is most likely, if he is uncertain as to how many rak’ahs he has prayed, three or four, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Let him decide what is most likely the case, then complete it on that basis.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 1020)\xa0\nThis proves that in matters of worship it is sufficient to base one’s actions on what he thinks is most likely the case. This is because Allah wants to make things easy because it may not be possible to be certain.\xa0\nIf the pebbles land in the pit around the Jamarat, then the duty has been discharged, whether they stay in the pit or roll out of it.\xa0\n\nSome people think that the pebbles must hit the pillar in the pit. This is a mistaken notion, because it is not essential for the stoning to be valid that the pebbles should hit this pillar. This pillar is only there as a marker for the pit in which the pebbles land. If the pebbles land in the pit that is sufficient, whether they hit the pillars or not.\xa0\n\n\nOne of the most serious mistakes that are made is when some people take the matter of stoning the Jamarat lightly, and delegate someone else to do it on their behalf even though they are able to do it. This is a serious mistake, because stoning the Jamarat is one of the rituals of Hajj. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n\n“And perform properly (i.e. all the ceremonies according to the ways of Prophet Muhammad), the Hajj and `Umrah (i.e. the pilgrimage to Makkah) for Allah.” [Al-Baqarah 2:196]\nThis means completing Hajj with all its rituals in full. So each person must do them himself, and not delegate someone else to do it on his behalf.\xa0\nSome people say, “The place is too crowded and it is too difficult for me.” We say to them, “If the crowding is too bad when the people first come to Mina from Muzdalifah it will not be so bad at the end of the day, or at night. If you do not manage to stone the Jamarat during the day, then you can do it at night, because night is also the time for stoning, although the day is preferable. But it is better for a person to come and do the stoning at night in a calm, dignified and humble manner than to come during the day fearing that he may die because of the overcrowding, and he may throw his pebbles and they may not land in the pit. The point is if someone uses the overcrowding as an excuse, we say to him: Allah has given plenty of room for manoeuvre, so you can stone the Jamarat at night.\xa0\nSimilarly if a woman is afraid of something if she stones the Jamarat with the people, she can delay it until the night. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not allow the weak ones among his family – such as Sawdah bint Zam’ah (may Allah be pleased with her) and those like her – to forego stoning the Jamarat and to delegate someone else to do it on their behalf; rather he gave them permission to leave Muzdalifah at the end of the night, to stone the Jamarat before the place became crowded. This is the greatest evidence that a woman should not delegate this task just because she is a woman.\xa0\nYes, if a person is disabled and unable to stone the Jamarat by himself, either during the day or at night, then in this case it is permissible for him to delegate it to someone else , because he is incapable of doing it. It was narrated from the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) that they used to stone the Jamarat on behalf of their children, because the children were unable to do it.\xa0\nWhatever the case, being careless with regard to this matter – i.e., delegating the stoning of the Jamarat, except for those who have excuses which mean that they are unable to do it – is a serious mistake, because it is carelessness with regard to an act of worship, and negligence with regard to a duty.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34420/mistakes-made-when-stoning-the-jamarat
