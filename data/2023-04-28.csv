178915,"It is well known that Ahl as-Sunnah wa’l-Jama‘ah affirm the attributes of Allah, may He be glorified, without discussing how they are, without likening or comparing Him to His creation, and without denying any of them. When they affirm them, they do not discuss how they are, and they understand them on the basis of the famous statement of Imam Malik: “The istiwa’ [Allah’s rising over the Throne] is known, but how it occurred is unknown.” What I do not understand is that if we apply this to all of the divine attributes, someone may ask us: So what is meant by Allah smiling? Or what is meant by the Countenance of Allah? Or what is meant by the mercy of Allah, or what is meant by the Shin of Allah, and all other divine attributes? Shouldn’t we understand their meaning in a manner that is befitting to Allah, so we will not be like those who say, “We do not know and we leave their meaning to Allah”? The problem is that when the Arabs interpreted the meanings of the divine attributes, they would interpret them on the basis of what they saw of created beings. Please explain, because we are confused about this, as some of the innovators among the Ash‘aris have made us confused.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nAhl as-Sunnah wa’l-Jama‘ah do not discuss how the divine attributes are; rather they leave knowledge of that to Allah. Hence they believe in the attributes of Allah, may He be exalted, and they believe in their meanings, but they leave the matter of how they are to Him, may He be glorified.\nIbn al-Majishon, Ahmad ibn Hanbal and others among the early generations said: We do not know the nature of what Allah has attributed to Himself, even though we understand what the words mean.""(Dar’ Ta‘arud al-‘Aql wa’n-Naql\xa0 1/115).\nAbu’t-Tayyib, the father of Abu Hafs ibn Shahin, (may Allah have mercy on him) said: I attended a lesson with Abu Ja‘far at-Tirmidhi and someone asked him about the hadith which speaks of the descent of the Lord [in the last third of the night]: How does this descent occur? Will there be something above Him? He replied: We understand the descent [in linguistic terms], how it occurs is unknown, believing in it is obligatory and asking about it is an innovation (bid‘ah).\nAdh-Dhahabi said: The jurist and scholar of Baghdad in his time spoke the truth, for asking about the divine descent is not ambiguous, because people usually ask about ambiguous words in the language. Rather the divine descent, speech, hearing, seeing, knowledge and rising over the Throne are phrases which are clear in meaning for anyone who hears them. But if they are ascribed to the One of Whom it is said that there is none like unto Him, then the attribute is connected to the One to Whom it is ascribed, and its nature is unknown to people.""(Al-‘Uluw li’l-‘Aliy al-Ghaffar\xa0 p. 2130214).\nAbu Bakr al-Isma‘ili said: We believe that Allah rose over the Throne, without discussing how, because He has said that He rose over the Throne, but He did not say how He rose over it.""(Ma‘arij al-Qubul 1/198).\nThe creed (‘aqidah) of Ahl as-Sunnah wa’l-Jama‘ah regarding the attributes of Allah, may He be exalted, is that they affirm them and affirm the meanings indicated by the words in linguistic terms, and they leave knowledge of how the attributes are and their nature to Him, whilst believing that we cannot compare any of the divine attributes to the attributes of created beings, for there is none like unto Him, may He be glorified, either in His Essence or in His attributes.\nSecondly:\nWith regard to the questioner’s saying that if we say this, someone may ask us: So what is meant by Allah smiling? Or what is meant by the Countenance of Allah?\nwe say: What is meant by Allah’s smiling is to affirm that Allah, may He be exalted, possesses the attribute of smiling in a true – not metaphorical – sense, in a manner that is befitting to Him, may He be glorified, without likening Him to His creation or discussing how it is. Therefore we are affirm the attribute and affirm the linguistic meaning, and we leave knowledge of how it is to Him, as noted above. This is applicable to each of the divine attributes.\nShaykh Ibn Jibrin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWe affirm the divine attribute, but we do not liken or compare it to the attributes of His creation, because likening and comparison can only be between created beings. We say: If Allah, may He be exalted, has affirmed it for Himself, then we affirm it without going to extremes in discussing it, or saying anything that is not true. It is known that the attribute of a created being is something that it is appropriate for him, so in the case of the created being, the word dahk (smiling or laughing) refers to laughing, making a sound, at something that he admires or which brings him joy or makes him happy. But in the case of Allah, He smiles as He wills, in a manner that is appropriate to Him, the nature of which we do not know.""(Fatawa ash-Shaykh Ibn Jibrin\xa0 63/96).\nThirdly:\nWith regard to the questioner’s saying, Shouldn’t we understand their meaning in a manner that is befitting to Allah, so we will not be like those who say, “We do not know and we leave their meaning to Allah”?\nWe have previously discussed, in the answer to question 138920 , what is meant by leaving the meaning of the divine names and attributes to Allah. To sum up what was mentioned there, leaving the meaning thereof to Allah is of two types. The first type is affirming the words and the meanings indicated by them, then leaving knowledge of how they are to Allah. This way is correct, and it is the view of Ahl as-Sunnah.\nThe second type is affirming the word [which refers to a divine attribute] without affirming its meaning. This way is incorrect.\nThere is a difference between affirming the meaning of the attribute in the true sense of the word, and affirming the nature of that attribute.\nThe scholars of the Permanent Committee said:\nWhat is required is to affirm what Allah affirmed for Himself of two hands, two feet, fingers and other attributes which are mentioned in the Qur’an and Sunnah, in the way that is befitting to Allah, may He be glorified, without distorting the meaning or discussing how they are, and without likening Him to His creation or denying the divine attributes. They are to be taken as something real, not something metaphorical.""(Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah\xa0 2/376).\nTherefore we must differentiate between the meaning, which we are obliged to believe in and affirm, and discussing the nature of the attribute, which we cannot know, because there is nothing like unto our Lord, may He be glorified and exalted.\nShaykh al-Islam (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nMore than one of those who narrated consensus among the early generation, including al-Khattabi. \xa0The view of the early generations was that the verses which speak of the divine attributes are to be understood according to their apparent meaning, without trying to say how the divine attributes are or likening them to the attributes of created beings. This means that the way we should speak of the divine attributes is the same way we should speak of the divine Essence, and the same approach should be followed. So if the way to speak about His Essence is by affirming the existence of His Essence, without discussing its nature, then the way to speak about His attributes is to affirm that they exist, without discussing how they are. Hence we say that Allah has a hand and can hear, but we do not say that what is meant by His hand is power, or that what is meant by His hearing is knowledge.… These attributes are to be ascribed to Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, in a manner that is befitting to His Majesty, just as the attributes of anything are to be ascribed to it in a manner that is befitting to it. Thus it is established that knowledge is an attribute which is to be ascribed to Allah, and it has its own characteristics, and the same is true of the divine Countenance.… Similarly, with regard to His actions, we know that the act of creation means bringing something into existence from nothing, even though we cannot discuss how that action happens and we cannot compare it to our own actions, for we do not do any action except when we need to do that action, whereas Allah is Free of need, Worthy of praise. Similarly, what is meant by the Divine Essence is known in general terms, even though it cannot be compared to the essences of created beings, and no one knows how it is except Him, and no one could comprehend how His Essence is. This is how we should understand the divine attributes.\nThe believer learns about the impact of these attributes, for that is the purpose of learning about them. Therefore he learns that Allah has power over all things, and that Allah has encompassed all things with His knowledge, and that on the Day of Resurrection, the entire earth will be in His grip, and the heavens will be rolled up in His Right Hand , and that the believers will gaze upon the Countenance of their Creator in Paradise and will find pleasure therein beside which all other pleasures will fade into insignificance, and so on. He also learns that he has a Lord, Creator and One Who is worthy of worship, but he does not understand the nature of any of that. Rather all that people may understand is like that: they understand some aspects of a thing, but they do not comprehend its essence, and in fact their knowledge of their own selves is also like that.""(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa\xa06/355-358).\nFourthly:\nWith regard to the questioner’s words: The problem is that when the Arabs interpreted the meanings of the divine attributes, they would interpret them on the basis of what they saw of created beings,\nwe say:\nWhen the Arabs interpreted the attributes of created beings, they interpreted them on the basis of what they saw, knew and understood of them. How can we discuss the nature of the divine attributes when there is none like unto Him, may He be exalted, no vision can encompass Him, and they cannot encompass Him with their knowledge?\nNo one will be safe from the specious arguments of the innovators except one who follows the way and path of the early generations and follows in their footsteps.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/178915/how-the-believer-should-understand-the-names-and-attributes-of-allah-and-what-they-mean
148099,I read in the answer to question no. 31807 :,"['Praise be to Allah.If the Muslim is content with the ruling of Allah and submits to it, and he does not reject it or object to it, this is what is required of him, and it will not matter whether he has a natural aversion towards it, such as the natural aversion to fighting, if he accepts it and submits to the ruling of Allah. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Fighting has been enjoined upon you while it is hateful to you. But perhaps you hate a thing and it is good for you; and perhaps you love a thing and it is bad for you. And Allah Knows, while you know not}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:216].\nAn example of that is a woman’s disliking any competition. This is something natural, because a co-wife is going to compete with her over her husband. But there is a difference between resenting the fact that Allah has enjoined fighting and a natural aversion towards fighting, between resenting Allah’s prescription of polygamy and a natural aversion towards having a co-wife. Whatever Allah has enjoined and prescribed, we must love it out of faith and to draw close to Him, even if one feels an aversion towards the action that has been enjoined and finds it difficult. However, the stronger a person’s faith grows, the more he will come to love these things to which he had felt this natural aversion, and he will begin to love them out of faith.\nWhat was mentioned about the things that nullify Islam refers to resentment towards what Allah has sent down, and resentment towards what He has prescribed.\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is not a condition of being content with what Allah has prescribed that one should not feel pain and hardship when doing it; rather the condition is that one should not object to the ruling or feel resentment towards it. Hence some people did not understand how someone could be content with that which he dislikes and feels a natural aversion to, and they criticised this idea by saying: This is not possible and is contrary to human nature; rather it is only patience (without contentment), otherwise how could contentment and resentment coexist, when they are opposites?\nThe correct view is that there is no contradiction between them, and feeling pain and natural aversion does not contradict contentment, just as one who is sick will be content to take unpleasant medicine, and one who is fasting will be content to fast on a hot day and undergo the pain of hunger and thirst, and the mujahid will be content with what he faces of the pain of injury, and so on, in Allah’s cause.""(Madarij as-Salikin\xa0 2/175).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said, explaining this matter: Regarding the words of Allah {while it is hateful to you} [al-Baqarah 2:216], the word kurh [translated here as “it is hateful”] means it is disliked by you. [\nThe phrase {while it is hateful to you} refers to a state of mind. The pronoun “it” refers to fighting, not to the fact that it is enjoined, for the Muslims do not resent what Allah has enjoined upon them; rather their dislike of fighting is a natural, human aversion. There is a difference between saying, “We resent what Allah has enjoined of fighting” and saying, “We feel a natural aversion towards fighting.” Feeling an aversion towards fighting is something natural, for a person would dislike fighting someone and killing him, or being killed himself. But when this fighting is enjoined upon us by Allah, it becomes beloved to us in one way and disliked by us in another way. From the perspective that Allah has enjoined it upon us, we love it; hence the Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) would come to the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and insist on joining the fight. But from the perspective that we have a natural aversion towards it, it is disliked by us.\nThen he noted that one of the things we learn from the verse is that there is nothing wrong with a person disliking what is prescribed for him, not because the Lawgiver has prescribed it, but because of his natural aversion towards it. But from the perspective that the Lawgiver has enjoined it, then what we must do is be content and happy with it.""(Tafsir al-Qur’an by Ibn ‘Uthaymin).\nElsewhere, he (may Allah have mercy on him) said: From the words {while it is hateful to you}, you should understand that the pronoun here refers to fighting, and does not refer to the fact that it is enjoined, because the Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) could not have resented what Allah enjoined; rather they disliked the idea of fighting and being killed.\nThere is a difference between a person disliking the ruling of Allah and his disliking what is enjoined.""(Mu’allafat ash-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin\xa0 2/438).\nConclusion: The believing woman should be content with the fact that Allah has prescribed polygamy, and she should believe that there is wisdom in it and that it serves an interest. She should not resent this ruling, even if she has a natural aversion to the presence of a co-wife who competes with her, just as men dislike fighting. People may feel a natural aversion towards that which causes discomfort, such as doing wudu’ with cold water for Fajr prayer, fasting in intense heat, and other things that involve hardship, but we should suppress these negative thoughts out of love for Allah, and we should be content with His ruling and submit to what He has prescribed. Hence it says in the hadith which was narrated by al-Bukhari (6487) and Muslim (2823) from Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Paradise is surrounded with hardships [which people dislike] and Hell is surrounded with desires [which people like].”\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Sharh Muslim: As for the hardships, they include striving in doing acts of worship and persisting in that, bearing with patience the hardships involved therein, and suppressing rage, forgiving people, being forbearing, giving charity, showing kindness to the one who mistreats you, showing patience in resisting desires, and so on. End quote.\nSimilar to that is the hadith in which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Shall I not tell you something by means of which Allah erases sins and raises people in status?” They said: Yes, O Messenger of Allah. He said: “Doing wudu’ properly at times when it is difficult to do so, taking many steps to the mosque, and waiting for prayer after prayer. That is constant readiness.” Narrated by Muslim 9251) from Abu Hurayrah.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The difficulties [involved in doing wudu’ properly] include doing it when it is very cold or one is suffering physical pain, and so on.
