325739,Who are the scholars who talk about reincarnation of souls and the life cycle?,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly: What is meant by reincarnation of souls\nWhat is meant by reincarnation of souls is that when a person dies, his body dies and his soul is released to dwell in another body, according to what he did of deeds in his previous life, and thus the soul begins a new cycle.\nSee: al-Mawsu‘ah al-Muyassarah fi’l-Adyan (2/728).\nSecondly: Belief in reincarnation of souls constitutes disbelief (kufr)\nBelief in reincarnation of souls constitutes disbelief (kufr). We have discussed this in the answer to question no. 14379 .\nAl-Qadi ‘Iyad said: Likewise, we definitively state that he is a disbeliever who believes in the reincarnation of souls and says that they keep moving from one body to another for ever and ever, and that they will suffer torment or enjoy bliss in those bodies, according to whether they are good or evil.""(Ash-Shifa’\xa02/1067-1077).\nAd-Dardir al-Maliki said: A person becomes a disbeliever if he believes in reincarnation of souls. In other words, the one who says that whoever dies, his soul will move to another body like his, or one that is superior to it if the soul was obedient, or he will move to one that is inferior to it or similar to it if the soul was disobedient, is a disbeliever, because this is denying the resurrection.\nEnd quote from ash-Sharh as-Saghir (6/147-148); Hashiyat ad-Dasuqi ‘ala ash-Sharh al-Kabir (4/269).\nThe Permanent Committee was asked: The philosophy professor told us that the soul moves from one human body to another. Is that true, and if it is true, how can it be the soul that is punished and brought to account, because if it moves then another person will be brought to account?\nThey replied:\nWhat the philosophy professor told you, about the soul moving from one human body to another, is not true. The basic principle regarding that is the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And [mention] when your Lord took from the children of Adam - from their loins - their descendants and made them testify of themselves, [saying to them], “Am I not your Lord?” They said, “Yes, we have testified.” [This] - lest you should say on the day of Resurrection, “""Indeed, we were of this unaware.”}\xa0[Al-A‘raf 7:172].\nThe explanation of this verse is to be found in the report narrated by Malik in his Muwatta’, according to which ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) was asked about this verse (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And [mention] when your Lord took from the children of Adam - from their loins - their descendants and made them testify of themselves, [saying to them], “Am I not your Lord?” They said, “Yes, we have testified.” [This] - lest you should say on the day of Resurrection, “""Indeed, we were of this unaware.”}\xa0[Al-A‘raf 7:172].\n‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) being asked about it, and the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah, may He be exalted, created Adam, then He touched his back with His right hand and brought forth some progeny from him, and He said: ‘I have created these for Paradise, and they will do the deeds of the people of Paradise.’ Then He touched his back and brought forth some progeny from him, and He said: ‘I have created these for the Fire and they will do the deeds of the people of the Fire…’”\nIbn ‘Abd al-Barr said: Regarding the meaning of this hadith, which was soundly narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) via many proven isnads from ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab, ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ood, ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib and Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with them all) and others,\nAhl as-Sunnah wa’l-Jama‘ah are unanimously agreed on that. They said that saying that the soul moves from one body to another is expressing the belief of those who believe in reincarnation, who are the worst of disbelievers and this belief of theirs is the falsest of falsehoods.""(Fatawa al-Lajnah\xa0 2/435).\nThirdly: The scholars who talk about reincarnation of souls\nAmong those scholars who spoke about the reincarnation of souls are the following:\nAl-Fasl fi’l-Milal wa’l-Ahwa’ wa’n-Nihal by Ibn Hazm (1/76 ff).\nAthar al-Milal wa’n-Nihal al-Qadimah fi Ba‘d al-Firaq al-Muntasibah ila al-Islam, by Dr. ‘Abd al-Qaadir ibn Muhammad ‘Ata Sufi (69).\nIbn al-Qayyim also spoke about it in his books ar-Ruh (304) and Tariq al-Hijratayn (249-250).\nFor more information, please see: ar-Ruhiyyah al-Hadithah by Dr. Muhammad Muhammad Husayn (may Allah have mercy on him).']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/325739/reincarnation-of-souls
385395,Are zombies kufr to believe in and is blasphemy if it's both then answer by say both if it's one of them say which one.,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe term “zombie”\nA zombie is a reanimated corpse that is made to move by means of witchcraft. The word is usually used to describe someone who has been put to sleep and has lost consciousness. From the end of the nineteenth century, the character of the zombie became noticeably popular, especially in North America and in European folklore. In the modern era, the word zombie is used to refer to the living dead in horror movies.\nSecondly:\nThe idea of zombies is in harmony with denial of the resurrection and belief in the transmigration of souls.\nAccording to Islamic creed, there is no such thing as zombies or the living dead who come back to life and eat others, or do not eat. Everyone who dies will remain dead until Allah resurrects him on the Day of Resurrection, and there is no exception to that except in very few cases, where Allah brought people back to life as a miracle for a Prophet of His, as He did for ‘Isa (peace be upon him).\nAs for the rest of the dead, they will remain in al-barzakh, enjoying bliss or suffering torment, until Israfil gives the second trumpet blast, whereupon they will come back to life and emerge from their graves, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{ And the Horn [Trumpet]. Will be blown; and at once from the graves to their Lord they will hasten}\xa0[Ya-Sin 36:51];\nthat is, they will emerge from their graves.\nAnd Allah has told us that at the time of death, the disbelievers ask to go back to this world so that they might do righteous deeds, and He, may He be glorified, has stated that that will not happen, and that He has spoken and ruled that they will never go back, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{[For such is the state of the disbelievers], until, when death comes to one of them, he says, “My Lord, send me back,\nThat I might do righteousness in that which I left behind.” No! It is only a word he is saying; and behind them is a barrier until the Day they are resurrected}\xa0[Al-Mu’minun 23:99-100].\nAt-Tirmidhi (3010) and Ibn Majah (2800) narrated that Jabir ibn ‘Abdillah said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) met me and said to me: “O Jabir, why do I see you looking downcast?” I said: O Messenger of Allah, my father has been martyred, and he left behind dependents and debt. He said: “Shall I not give you the glad tidings of how Allah received your father? I said: Of course, O Messenger of Allah. He said: “Allah has never spoken to anyone except from behind a screen, but He brought your father back to life and spoke to him directly, and said, ‘O My slave, wish and I shall grant it to you.’ He said, ‘O my Lord, bring me back to life so that I may be killed for Your sake a second time.’ The Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, said, ‘I have already decreed that they will not return (to the world after death).’”\nBelief in the existence of the living dead who exist at present or will exist in the future constitutes disbelief that is contrary to what is well established according to Islamic teachings, which is that the one who dies will not return; rather he will remain in al-barzakh until the Day of Resurrection.\nThe idea of zombies is in harmony with denial of the resurrection and belief in the transmigration of souls. Those who believe in this idea base it on the view that there will be no resurrection in the hereafter; rather a person will die and return repeatedly, without end, or he will die and his soul will move to another body. Denial of the resurrection constitutes disbelief (kufr).\nConclusion:\nThe idea that the dead can return to this world constitutes disbelief (kufr) and is a rejection of the religious texts. If, in addition to that, there is denial of the resurrection and the reckoning, then this is misguidance upon misguidance.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/385395/does-believing-in-the-existence-of-zombies-constitute-disbelief-kufr
