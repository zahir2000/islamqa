378208,"Is it permissible for a woman who is living on her own, with no one else, to keep a dog for protection in her apartment? She has no option but to keep the dog inside the apartment for the purpose of protection. What is the ruling? Will the angels refuse to enter the house or not? What is the rule on praying, if the angels refuse to enter the house? If we allocate a specific room that the dog cannot enter, will the angels enter that room, or will they refuse to enter the house altogether?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nRuling on keeping dogs\nIt is not permissible to keep dogs , except a dog for hunting or guarding livestock or guarding crops.\nThe evidence for that is the report narrated by al-Bukhari (2145) from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever keeps a dog, one or two qirats will be deducted from his good deeds every day, except a dog for guarding the crops or guarding livestock.\nMuslim (2974) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever keeps a dog, except a dog for hunting or guarding livestock or land, two qirats will be deducted from his reward every day.”\nAnd Muslim (2943) narrated from ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: Whoever keeps a dog, except a dog for guarding livestock or a dog for hunting, a qirat will be deducted from his good deeds each day.” ‘Abdullah said: Abu Hurayrah said: Or a dog for guarding crops.\nSecondly:\nDifference of scholarly opinion regarding the permissibility of keeping a dog for purposes other than hunting or guarding livestock and crops\nThe scholars differed regarding keeping dogs for purposes other than these three, such as keeping them to protect houses and their occupants. Most of the scholars say that this is permissible, and that is more likely to be correct.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: There is a difference of scholarly opinion regarding the permissibility of keeping dogs for purposes other than these three, such as protecting houses and roads. The more correct view is that it is permissible, by analogy with these three, because of the reason implied in the hadith, which is if there is a need for that.""(Sharh Muslim\xa0 10/236).\nThat is if there is a need to protect the house, but the fact that a woman is living alone in the house does not on its own justify keeping a dog, unless she fears for herself because she is living in a remote area, or because she has no neighbours around her, and so on, and having a dog with her will serve the purpose of protection, and it will not just be company for her or something that is done for fun.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Based on that, if the house is in the middle of the city, there is no need to have a dog to guard it, so keeping a dog for this purpose in this situation is haram and is not permissible, and it will detract one or two qirats from the reward of its owners every day. So they should get rid of the dog and not keep it. But if the house is in the wilderness, with no one around, then it is permissible to keep a dog to guard the house and the people in it, because it is more important to guard the people of the household than to guard flocks and crops.""(Majmu‘ Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymin\xa04/246).\nThirdly:\nIf there is a need to have a dog and keep it inside the house\nIf there is a need to have a dog and keep it inside the house, it should be in its own room, so as to protect the house from being contaminated with impurity (najasah). That will not prevent the angels from entering the rest of the house, in sha Allah, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The angels do not enter a room in which there are images.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (5961) and Muslim (2104).\xa0\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If the image is haram, then what appears to be the case – and Allah knows best – is that if it is in one room, that does not include the entire house, especially if the people of the household do not approve of having these images in the house, because in some families there may be one person who has been misled by the devils, so he collects images and keeps them with him or hangs them on the walls, and the other family members dislike that but cannot stop him from doing it. In this case, if the other family members dislike that, the angels will not refrain from entering the house.\nAs for a room in which there are images, the angels do not enter a room in which there are images.""(Liqa’ al-Bab al-Maftuh\xa0 75/28).\nIn the case of a dog which it is permissible to keep, that does not prevent the angels from entering the room where it is, according to the correct view.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: al-Khattabi said: The angels only refrain from entering the room in which there is a dog or image when it is haram to keep that dog or image. But if the dog or image is not haram – such as dogs for hunting, and guarding crops and livestock, and images that are not treated with respect, as they are on rugs, pillows and the like – the angels do not refrain from entering because of that. Al-Qadi referred to something similar to what al-Khattabi said.""(Sharh Muslim\xa014/84).\nIt says in Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah (26/163): The fact that the angels do not enter a house in which there is a dog or an image is narrated in as-Sahihayn. My question is: If someone keeps a dog for a necessary reason, such as guarding chickens, what does Islam say about that?\nAnswer: If someone keeps a dog for hunting or guarding, that is permissible for him, so it does not prevent the angels from entering the house.\n‘Abdullah ibn Ghadyan, Abd ar-Razzaq ‘Afifi, ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn ‘Abdillah ibn Baz. End quote.\nConclusion:\nIf there is a need for protection, for fear of thieves and the like, and there is no alternative but to keep the dog in the apartment, there is nothing wrong with that. But it should have its own room, to protect the rest of the house from becoming contaminated with impurity (najasah).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/378208/ruling-on-keeping-a-dog-for-protection-inside-an-apartment-if-it-is-kept-in-a-separate-room-will-that-prevent-the-angels-from-entering-the-rest-of-the-house
134621,"I would like to learn about the Sunnah of doing business. How did the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) do business? How did he describe products, exchange them, return them, and so on?","['Praise be to Allah.Prophet Muhammad’s advice on business\nWe can sum up the teachings of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) with regard to doing business, buying and selling, as follows:\xa0\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) worked in business before his mission began, with his paternal uncle Abu Talib, and he also worked for Khadijah (may Allah be pleased with her), and he travelled for that purpose to greater Syria. He also did business in the markets; Majannah and ‘Ukath were markets during the Jahiliyyah [the pre-Islamic era] to which merchants would come to buy and sell.\xa0\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to engage directly in transactions himself, as we shall see below in the Hadith about the camel of ‘Umar and the camel of Jabir (may Allah be pleased with them both). He also used to appoint one of his companions to do that for him, as in the case of ‘Urwah ibn Abu Al-Ja‘d Al-Bariqi (may Allah be pleased with him), who said that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) gave him a Dinar to buy a sacrificial animal or a sheep for him. He bought two sheep and sold one for a Dinar, and he came back with a sheep and a Dinar. He (the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) prayed for blessing for him in his business dealings, and (after that) if he had bought dust he would have made a profit.\xa0(Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 1258; Abu Dawood, 3384; Ibn Majah, 2402; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Tirmidhi.)\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to enjoin traders to be righteous and honest and to give charity.\xa0\nIt was narrated that Hakim ibn Hizam (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The two parties to a transaction have the option (of cancelling it) until they part. If they are honest and disclose any defects, their transaction will be blessed, but if they lie and conceal defects the blessing of their transaction will be erased.”\xa0(Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 1973 and Muslim, 1532)\xa0\nIt was narrated from Isma`il ibn `Ubayd ibn Rifa`ah from his father from his grandfather that he went out with the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to the prayer place, and he saw the people engaging in trade. He said:\xa0 “O merchants!” and they responded to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), craning their necks and looking up at him. He (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him said, “The merchants will be raised on the Day of Resurrection as evildoers, apart from those who fear Allah and are sincere and honest.”\xa0(Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 1210; Ibn Majah, 2146; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Targhib, 1785).\xa0\nIt was narrated that Qays ibn Abu Gharazah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to say: “O merchants, selling involves idle talk and oaths, so mix it with Sadaqah (charity).”\xa0(Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 1208; Abu Dawood, 3326; An-Nasa’i, 3797; Ibn Majah, 2145; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawood.)\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to enjoin people to be tolerant and easy-going in buying and selling .\xa0\nIt was narrated from Jabir ibn ‘Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “May Allah have mercy upon a man who is easy-going when he sells and when he buys and when he asks for payment.”\xa0(Al-Bukhari, 1970)\xa0\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“In this Hadith it is encouraged to be easy-going in transactions, to have the most sublime of attitudes, and to avoid miserliness, and it is encouraged to avoid putting pressure on people when asking for payment, and to take from them what they can afford.” (Fath Al-Bari, 4/307)\xa0\nExamples of the tolerance and easy-going nature of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) include the following:\xa0\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 It was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: We were with the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on a journey, and I was riding on a recalcitrant young camel belonging to ‘Umar. It kept getting the better of me and kept going ahead of the people, so ‘Umar kept checking and making it go back. Then it went on ahead and ‘Umar checked it and made it go back. Then the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Sell it to me.” He said: It is yours, O Messenger of Allah. He said: “Sell it to me.” So he sold it to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “It is yours, O ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar; do with it whatever you will.”\xa0(Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 2610)\xa0\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 It was narrated from Jabir ibn ‘Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) that he was riding on a camel of his that had become exhausted to the point that he wanted to let it go. He said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) caught up with me and offered supplication for me, and he hit it and the camel started moving (energetically) as I had never seen it move before. He said: “Sell it to me for one Uqiyah.” I said: No. He (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Sell it to me.” So I sold it to him for one Uqiyah and stipulated that I be allowed to ride it home. When I arrived I brought the camel to him, and he gave me its price, then I left. He sent someone after me and said: “Did you think that I bargained with you in order to take away your camel? Take your camel and its price; they are both yours.”\xa0(Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 1991 and Muslim, 715)\xa0\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to give people their rights and urge others to do likewise.\xa0\nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: A man was owed a camel of a certain age by the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), so he came to him to ask him to repay him, and he said: “Give him.” They looked, but they could not find anything but a camel that was older than his, so he said: “Give him.” He said: You have paid me back in full, may Allah reward you. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Verily the best of you are those who are the best in paying off debts.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 2182 and Muslim, 1601)\xa0\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to urge people to let a buyer cancel the transaction if he regrets it.\xa0\nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever lets a Muslim off (a transaction), Allah will relieve him of his distress on the Day of Resurrection.”\xa0(Narrated by Abu Dawud, 3460 and Ibn Majah, 2199; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud)\xa0\nLetting someone off means being easy-going and agreeing to cancel a sale or purchase; it is indicative of generosity of spirit.\xa0\nWhat is meant by letting someone off a sale is: if someone buys something from a man, then regrets his purchase, either because he feels that he did not get a good deal, or because he no longer has any need of it, or because he does not have the wherewithal to pay for it, so he returns the item to the seller and the seller agrees to take it back, Allah will remove his hardship and distress on the Day of Resurrection, because of his kindness towards the buyer, because the transaction has been finalised, so the purchaser could not cancel it."" (`Awn Al-Ma`bud)\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to bargain with people when buying , but he would not go so far as to undermine the real value of the item, as we have seen above in the Hadith about the camel of Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him).\xa0\nIt was narrated that Suwayd ibn Qays (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Makhramah Al-`Abdi and I brought some garments from Hajar to Makkah. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came to us on foot and bargained with us for some trousers, and we sold them to him. (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 1305 – he said: it is authentic.

145514,"Could you explain to me this hadith: it was narrated from Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever would like his rizq (provision) to be abundant and his lifespan to be extended, let him uphold his ties of kinship”? What is meant by “and his lifespan to be extended”?","['Praise be to Allah.Al-Bukhari (2067) and Muslim (2557) narrated that Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “Whoever would like his rizq (provision) to be abundant and his lifespan to be extended, let him uphold his ties of kinship.”\nAbundance in provision means that it is increased, caused to grow and expand, and made blessed; it refers to it being increased in a real sense.\nThe explanations given by the scholars for the phrase “yunsa’ lahu fi atharihi [translated above as: and his lifespan to be extended]” differed.\nIt was said that it means an increase in his physical strength.\nAnd it was said that it refers to blessing in his lifespan, being enabled to do acts of worship and obedience, being enabled to use his time in ways that will benefit him in the hereafter and ensuring that his time is not wasted in anything other than that.\nAnd it was said that what is meant is that he will be well remembered after he dies.\nAnd it was said that it means that his lifespan is written and connected to a condition such as a stipulation that if he uphold his ties of kinship, then his life will be [increased by] such and such, otherwise it will only be as originally decreed, so the addition to his lifespan will be an addition in a real sense.\nSee: Sharh an-Nawawi ‘ala Muslim (16/114); Fath al-Bari (4/302).\nThis last view is the one that is most likely to be correct. So what the hadith means is: whoever would like his provision to be made abundant, so that it will increase and be blessed for him, or would like his lifespan to be extended, let him uphold his ties of kinship.\nThus upholding ties of kinship is a prescribed means of increasing and expanding provision and of increasing and extending one’s lifespan. Were it not for that, this would not be his provision and this would not be his lifespan – by the decree and wisdom of Allah, may He be exalted.\nShaykh al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Sahih al-Adab al-Mufrad (1/24):\nThe hadith is to understood according to its apparent meaning, which is that Allah, in His wisdom, has caused upholding of ties of kinship to be a prescribed means of extending one’s lifespan. The same applies to having a good attitude and being good to one’s neighbours, as is mentioned in some sahih hadiths. This does not contradict what is well-known in Islamic teachings, that lifespans are already decided, because that is correct when looking at when lifespans end. This is exactly like the issue of whether a person is blessed (destined for Paradise) or doomed (destined for Hell). Whether a person is blessed or doomed is already decided with regard to individuals. However, it is well established in Islamic teachings that being blessed or doomed is connected to causes that lead to these two ends, as is mentioned in the religious texts.\nThat is similar to the case of faith (iman), which may increase and decrease. It increases when one does acts of worship and obedience and it decreases when one commits sins, yet that does not contradict what is written in al-Lawh al-Mahfuz. By analogy, lifespans may increase and decrease, depending on the measures that an individual takes. This also does not contradict what is written in al-Lawh al-Mahfuz. End quote.\nAt-Tahawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIt may be that when Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, wanted to create a particular soul, He decreed that if it upheld ties of kinship, its lifespan would be such and such [longer] and if it did not uphold ties of kinship, it would be of a shorter duration. Similarly, if that person offered supplication, certain things would be warded off from him, and if he did not offer supplication, certain things would befall him; if he did certain deeds, he would be deprived of certain things, and if he did not do those deeds, he would be granted certain things. All of that could be written in the pages of decrees to which nothing can be added and nothing can be taken away.""(Bayan Mushkil al-Athar\xa0 7/202).\nAl-Halimi (may Allah have mercy on him) said regarding the meaning of the hadith: in some cases, Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, decrees that if a person upholds his ties of kinship, he will live for a certain number of years, and if he severs those ties, he will live for fewer years than that. In this way we may understand the idea of something being added to his lifespan.""(Shu‘ab al-Iman\xa0 6/219).\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nA person’s lifespan is two lifespans, one that is not connected to anything, which is known only to Allah, and one that is subject to conditions. This explains the meaning of the Prophet’s words “Whoever would like his rizq (provision) to be abundant and his lifespan to be extended, let him uphold his ties of kinship.” Allah instructed the angel to write down the lifespan for him, and said: If he uphold his ties of kinship, I will increase it by such and such. The angel does not know whether it will be increased or not, but Allah knows how things will turn out, then when his ordained time of death comes, it will not be brought forward or put back.""(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa\xa0 8/517).\nShaykh Salih al-Fawzan (may Allah preserve him) said:\nWhat this means is that Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has promised the one who upholdd his ties of kinship that He will reward him by extending his lifespan and making his provision abundant, as a reward for his doing good.\nThere is no contradiction between this hadith and the hadith which says that the lifespan and provision of every person is already decreed when he is in his mother’s womb, because there are causes that Allah has ordained to extend one’s lifespan and causes for obtaining provision. This hadith indicates that being kind and upholding ties of kinship are a cause of lifespans being extended and provision being increased. It is Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, Who decrees things and ordains causes. There are things that Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has ordained and connected to causes and means. If these means are taken, fulfilling all the necessary conditions and avoiding impediments, then the expected results will materialise by His will and decree, and as a reward from Allah, may He be glorified and exalted.""(Al-Muntaqa min Fatawa al-Fawzan\xa0 98/1).\nShaykh Ibn Jibrin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThat is because Allah will reward a person with a reward that matches his deed. So whoever upholds his ties of kinship, Allah will increase his lifespan and provision in a real sense. And the opposite of that is that whoever severs ties of kinship, Allah will cut short his lifespan and provision.""(Fatawa ash-Shaykh Ibn Jibrin\xa0 54/13).']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/145514/commentary-on-the-hadith-whoever-would-like-his-rizq-provision-to-be-abundant-and-his-lifespan-to-be-extended-let-him-uphold-his-ties-of-kinship
146569,"It was narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that he said: “Allah has ninety-nine names; whoever memorises them will enter Paradise,” and one of these names is the greatest name of Allah which, if He is called upon thereby, He will answer and if He is asked thereby, He will give.","['Praise be to Allah.Reference to the greatest name of Allah in the Sunnah\nA number of Hadiths were narrated concerning the “greatest name of Allah ,” the most famous of which are the following:\n\nIt was narrated from Abu Umamah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The greatest name of Allah is in three Surahs of the Quran: Al-Baqarah, Al `Imran and Ta-Ha .” (Narrated by Ibn Majah, 3856; classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah)\nIt was narrated from Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) that he was sitting with the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and a man was praying then he said in supplication: O Allah, I ask You by virtue of the fact that all praise is due to You; there is none worthy of worship but You alone, and You have no partner or associate, the Bestower, the Originator of the heavens and the earth, the Possessor of majesty and honour, O Ever-Living, O Sustainer. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “He has asked Allah by His greatest name which, if He is called upon thereby He answers and if He is asked thereby He gives.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 3544, Abu Dawud, 1495, An-Nasa’i, 1300 and Ibn Majah, 3858. Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud.)\nIt was narrated from Buraydah ibn Al-Husayb (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) heard a man saying: O Allah, I ask You by virtue of the fact that I bear witness that You are Allah, there is none is worthy of worship but You, the One, the Eternal Refuge, Who neither begets nor is born, nor is there to Him any equivalent. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “He has indeed asked Allah by His greatest name, which if He is asked thereby, He gives and if He is called upon thereby, He answers.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 3475, Abu Dawud, 1493, Ibn Majah, 3857; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud)\n\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThis is the soundest of all reports concerning this matter in terms of its Isnad (chain of narration).\n\nIt was narrated from Asma’ bint Yazid (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The greatest name of Allah is in these two verses: `And your god is one God. There is no deity [worthy of worship] except Him, the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful’ [Al-Baqarah 2:163] and at the beginning of Surah Al `Imran: `Alif, Lam, Mim. Allah - there is no deity except Him, the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of existence’ [Al `Imran 3:1-2].” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 3478, Abu Dawud, 1496 and Ibn Majah, 3855)\n\nThis Hadith is inauthentic. Its Isnad includes `Ubaydullah ibn Abu Ziyad and Shahr ibn Hawshab, both of whom are weak narrators.\nScholars’ views on the greatest name of Allah\nThe scholars differed concerning the “greatest name of Allah” and whether there is such name. There are several views:\n\nThe first view is that there is no such name! Because they believe that none of the names of Allah, may He be Exalted, can be regarded as superior to another. These scholars interpreted the Hadiths quoted above in various ways:\n\n\nSome said that what is meant by the word Al-A`tham (the greatest) is Al-`Athim (the great), and that there can be no differentiation between the names of Allah, may He be Exalted.\n\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Some scholars – such as Abu Ja`far At-Tabari, Abu Al-Hasan Al-Ash`ari and a number of others after them, such as Abu Hatim ibn Hibban and Al-Qadi Abu Bakr Al-Baqillani, rejected that and said that it is not permissible to regard some of the divine names as being superior to others. Some of them attributed that view to Malik, because he regarded it as disliked to habitually recite or repeat one Surah rather than others, lest it be thought that some parts of the Quran are better than others, and that lead to believing that the less favoured parts are inferior to those that are more favoured. They interpreted the reports concerning that as indicating that what is meant by “the greatest” is “great”, and that all the names of Allah are great. When Abu Ja`far At-Tabari said: The reports differ as to which is the greatest name, and in my view all opinions are sound, because none of these reports state that it is the greatest name, and nothing is greater than Him, it was as if he was saying: each of the names of Allah, may He be Exalted, may be described as the greatest, in the sense that they are all great, as noted above.”\n\nThat what is intended in the Hadiths quoted above is to highlight the extra reward for the one who calls upon Allah by that name.\n\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Ibn Hibban said: What is meant by the greatness mentioned in the reports is the extra reward granted to the one who calls upon Allah by that name, just as there are Hadiths which speak of great reward for the one who recites the Quran; what is meant thereby is the extra reward of the reciter.”\xa0\n\nThat what is meant by the greatest name is the frame of mind and focus of the one who is calling upon Allah by that name, which includes everyone who calls upon Allah, may He be Exalted, by any of His names, if he has the right frame of mind.\n\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“It was said that what is meant by the greatest name is any of the names of Allah, may He be Exalted, by which a person calls upon Him with complete submission and focus of mind, in the sense that at that moment he has nothing in his mind except Allah, may He be Exalted. Whoever is like that will receive a response. Something similar to this was narrated from Ja`far As-Sa diq, from Al-Junayd, and from others.”\xa0\n\nThe second view is the view of those who say that Allah, may He be Exalted, has kept to Himself knowledge of His greatest name, and that He has not granted knowledge thereof to any of His creation.\n\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Others said: Allah, may He be Exalted, has kept to Himself knowledge of His greatest name, and that He has not granted knowledge thereof to any of His creation.” (See: Fath Al-Bari, by Ibn Hajar, 11/224)\n\nThe third view is the view of those who affirmed that the greatest name of Allah exists and that it is a specific name, but they differed as to which is the greatest name, and there are fourteen views! Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) has listed them in his book Fath Al-Bari (11/224-225). They are as follows:\n\n\nHu! (He!)\nAllah\nAllah Ar-Rahman Ar-Rahim (Allah the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful)\nAr-Rahman Ar-Rahim Al-Hayy Al-Qayyum (the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, the Ever-Living, the Sustainer)\nAl-Hayy Al-Qayyum (the Ever-Living, the Sustainer)\nAl-Hannan Al-Mannan Badi` As-Samawati wa’l-Ard Dhul-Jalali wal-Ikram Al-Hayy Al-Qayyum (the Compassionate, the Bestower, the Originator of the heavens and the earth, the Possessor of majesty and honour, Ever-Living, Sustainer)\nBadi` As-Samawati wa’l-Ard Dhul-Jalali wal-Ikram (the Originator of the heavens and the earth, the Possessor of majesty and honour)\nDhul-Jalali wal-Ikram (the Possessor of majesty and honour)\nAllahu la ilaha illa Huwa Al-Ahad As-Samad alladhi lam yalid wa lam yulad wa lam yakun lahu kufuwan ahad (Allah there is none worthy of worship but He, the One, the Eternal Refuge, who neither begets nor is born, Nor is there to Him any equivalent)\nRabb Rabb (Lord, Lord)\nThe prayer of Dhun-Nun in the belly of the fish: la ilaha illa anta subhanaka inni kuntu min Ath-thalimin (There is none worthy of worship\xa0 except You; Exalted are You. Indeed, I have been of the wrongdoers) [Al-Anbiya’ 21:87 -\xa0 interpretation of the meaning]\nHuwa Allah Allah Allah alladhi la\xa0 ilaha illa Huwa Rabb Al-`arsh Al-`athim (He is Allah, Allah, Allah, besides Whom there is no other god, Lord of the mighty Throne)\nIt is concealed within the divine names\nThe word of Tawhid: La ilaha ill-Allah (there is none worthy of worship but Allah).\n\nShaykh Al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“It should be understood that the scholars differed as to which is the greatest name of Allah, and there are fourteen views, which were listed by Ibn Hajar in Al-Fath, followed by the evidence for each view. Most of the evidence is from the Hadiths, but in some cases it is simply the view of an individual and no attention need be paid to it, such as the twelfth view, the evidence for which is that so and so asked Allah to teach him the greatest name, then he saw in a dream that it was “Allah Allah Allah alladhi la\xa0 ila ha illa Huwa Rabb Al-`arsh Al-`athim (He is Allah, Allah, Allah, besides Whom there is no other god, Lord of the Mighty Throne)”!\nSome of these Hadiths are authentic, but are ambiguous in meaning, and others are Mawquf [a statement of a Companion], like this one. Some of them are clear in meaning; they fall into two categories:\nThe first category is that which is sound and clear in meaning, namely the Hadith of Buraydah (may Allah be pleased with him), “Allah, there is none worthy of worship\xa0 but He, the One, the Eternal Refuge, Who neither begets nor is born…” Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This is more sound in terms of its isnad than everything else that has been narrated concerning that. And it is as he said (may Allah have mercy on him). Ash-Shawkani confirmed that in Tuhfat Adh-Dhakirin (p. 52). It is listed in Sahih Abu Dawud (1341).\nThe second category is those which are clear in meaning but are not sound, some of which Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) clearly stated were inauthentic, such as the Hadith which is quoted to support the third view, which was narrated from `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) in Ibn Majah (3859). It also appears in Da`if Ibn Majah (841). Concerning some other reports he did not say anything, such as the Hadith which is quoted to support the eighth view, namely the Hadith of Mu`adh ibn Jabal (may Allah be pleased with him) in At-Tirmidhi, which is listed in Ad-Da`ifah (no. 4520).\nThere are other Hadiths that are clear in meaning, but Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him did not quote them; however, they are Wahin (flimsy); they are also listed in the same book (nos. 2772, 2773 and 2775). (Silsilat Al-AHadith Ad-Da`ifah wa’l-Mawdu`ah, 13/279)\nThe\xa0 correct view regarding the greatest name of Allah\nPerhaps the view that is most likely of all of them to be correct is the view that the greatest name is “Allah,” because this is the one name which encompasses all the other names and attributes of Allah, may He be Exalted, and it is a name that was never given to anyone other than Allah, may He be Exalted. This is the view of most scholars.\n\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n\n“The name “Allah” is indicative of all the beautiful divine names and sublime attributes…” (Madarij As-Salikin (1/32)\n\nIbn Amir Haj Al-Hanafi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n\n“It was narrated that Muhammad ibn Al-Hasan said: I heard Abu Hanifah (may Allah have mercy on him) say: The greatest name of Allah is “Allah”. This is also the view of At-Tahawi and many of the scholars, and most of the devoted worshippers.” (At-Taqrir wat-Tahbir (1/5)\n\nAbu Al-Baqa’ Al-Fatuhi Al-Hanbali (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n\n“We learn two things:\n\nThe first is that the name “Allah” is a name that refers to His essence and is unique to Him, so it encompasses all of His beautiful names.\nThe second is that it is the greatest name of Allah according to most of the scholars, and is the name that is connected to all praiseworthy attributes.” (Sharh Al-Kawkab Al-Munir, p. 4)\n\n\nAsh-Shirbini Ash-Shafi`i (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n\nAccording to some scholars, it is the greatest name of Allah. It is mentioned in the Glorious Quran in two thousand three hundred and sixty (2360) places.” (Mughni Al-Muhtaj ila Ma`rifat Alfaz Al-Minha j (1/88, 89)\n\nShaykh `Umar Al-Ashqar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n\n“What appears to be the case from comparing the texts in which the greatest name of Allah is mentioned is that this name is “Allah”. This name is the only name which appears in all the texts concerning which the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) stated that the greatest name of Allah is mentioned in them.\nOne of the things which support the opinion that “Allah” is the greatest name is the fact that it is repeated in the Holy Quran 2697 times – according to the list in Al-Mu`jam Al-Mufahras [a famous concordance or index of the Quran] – and it is mentioned in the form “Allahumma” [a vocative form] five times, whereas another divine name which is applicable only to Allah, may He be Exalted – namely Ar-Rahman [the Most Gracious] – is mentioned only fifty-seven times. This idea is also supported by the fact that this name (“Allah”) encompasses many great and significant meanings.” (Al-`Aqidah fi Allah (Belief in Allah), p. 213)\nThe second of these views in terms of strength is the view that the greatest name of Allah is Al-Hayy Al-Qayyum (the Ever-Living, the Sustainer). This is the view of a number of scholars, including An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him), and it was regarded as more likely to be correct by Shaykh Al-`Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him).\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 11278 , 260383 , and 246242 .\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/146569/the-greatest-name-of-allah
