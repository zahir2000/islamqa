297658,I heard this on a video; how sound is it? “No one asks Allah for some worldly matter but he will get an equal amount of worries and stress.”,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nAs for this statement with this general meaning, it is undoubtedly false, for people have always asked their Lord and beseeched Him for what concerns them of some of their religious and worldly affairs.\nThere is nothing in Islamic teachings to forbid pursuing what is good in this world or to forbid striving for it.\nRather what is forbidden and blameworthy is for a person to have no concern for the hereafter and not strive for it or make any effort for it, and to have no interest in it; rather all his concern, effort and supplication have to do with this world and what it contains.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{ And when you have completed your rites, remember Allah like your [previous] remembrance of your fathers or with [much] greater remembrance. And among the people is he who says, “Our Lord, give us in this world,” and he will have in the Hereafter no share\nBut among them is he who says, “Our Lord, give us in this world [that which is] good and in the Hereafter [that which is] good and protect us from the punishment of the Fire.”\nThose will have a share of what they have earned, and Allah is swift in account}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:200-202].\nIt was narrated that Anas ibn Malik said: A man came to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and said: O Messenger of Allah, what supplication is best? He said: “Ask your Lord for pardon and wellbeing in this world and in the Hereafter.” Then (the man) came the next day and said: O Messenger of Allah, what supplication is best? He said: “Ask your Lord for pardon and for wellbeing in this world and in the Hereafter.” Then (the man) came the third day and said: O Prophet of Allah, what supplication is best? He said: “Ask your Lord for pardon and for wellbeing in this world and in the Hereafter, for if you are pardoned and granted wellbeing in this world and the Hereafter, you will have succeeded.”\nNarrated by Ibn Majah (3846) and others; classed as sahih by al-Albani.\nIt was narrated from Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) that it was said to him: Your brothers have come to you from Basra – and at that time he was in az-Zawiyah – so that you may pray to Allah for them. He said: May Allah forgive us, have mercy on us, and give us in this world that which is good and in the hereafter that which is good, and protect us from the Fire. They asked him to say more, so he said something similar, then he said: If you are granted this, then you have been granted all that is good in this world and the hereafter.\nNarrated by al-Bukhari in al-Adab al-Mufrad (633); classed as sahih by al-Albani.\nOn the contrary, this hadith definitively indicates that it is prescribed to offer supplication asking Allah for worldly matters.\nIt was narrated from ‘A’ishah that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) taught her the following supplication: “Allahumma inni as’aluka min al-khayri kullihi, ‘ajilihi wa ajilihi, ma ‘alimtu minhu wa ma lam a’lam. Wa a‘udhu bika min ash-sharri kullihi, ‘ajilihi wa ajilihi, ma ‘alimtu minhu wa ma lam a’lam. Allahumma inni as’aluka min khayri ma sa’alaka ‘abduka wa nabiyyuka, wa a‘udhu bika min sharri ma ‘adha bihi ‘abduka wa nabiyyuka. Allahumma inni as’aluka al-jannata wa ma qarraba ilayha min qawlin aw ‘amal, wa a‘udhu bika min al-naari wa ma qarraba ilayha min qawlin aw ‘amal, wa as’aluka an taj‘al kulla qadaa’in qadaytahu li khayran (O Allah, I ask You for all that is good, now and in the future, what I know of it and what I do not know. And I seek refuge with You from all evil, now and in the future, what I know and what I do not know.\xa0 O Allah, I ask You for the good that Your slave and Prophet asked You for, and I seek refuge with You from the evil from which Your slave and Prophet sought refuge. O Allah, I ask You for Paradise and for that which brings one closer to it, in word and deed, and I seek refuge in You from Hell and from that which brings one closer to it, in word and deed. And I ask You to make every decree that You decree concerning me good).”\nIt was narrated that Anas said: I came in one day and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was there, and there was no one except me, my mother, and Umm Haram, my maternal aunt. He came into our house and said to us: Shall I not lead you in prayer? And that was not at the time for any of the [five daily] prayers. A man who was present [when this hadith was narrated] said: Where did he make Anas stand? He said: He made him stand on his right, then he led us in prayer, then he offered supplication for us – the members of the household – asking for everything good in this world and the hereafter. My mother said: O Messenger of Allah, your little servant [meaning Anas]; pray to Allah for him. So he prayed for everything good for me, and at the end of his supplication he said: O Allah, grant him much wealth and many children, and bless him.\nNarrated by al-Bukhari in al-Adab al-Mufrad (88); classed as sahih by al-Albani.\nSecondly:\nWhat is blameworthy in that regard is two things:\n1. The first thing is when this world is all that a person cares about and strives for, as stated above, and he has no interest in the hereafter and does not strive for it.\nThat is when his supplication – which is one of the best ways of drawing close to Allah, and is an act of worship and one of the greatest means of attaining what one seeks – is all for worldly matters.\nIt was narrated from Ubayy ibn Ka‘b that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Give glad tidings to this ummah of prominence, victory and prevalence, so whoever among them does a deed pertaining to the hereafter for worldly gain, he will have no share in the hereafter.”\nNarrated by Ahmad (21223) and others; classed as sahih by al-Albani.\nIt was narrated that Zayd ibn Thabit (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “Whoever is focused only on this world, Allah will confound his affairs and make him fear poverty constantly, and he will not get anything of this world except that which has been decreed for him. Whoever is focused on the Hereafter, Allah will settle his affairs for him and make him feel content with his lot, and his provision and worldly gains will undoubtedly come to him.”\nNarrated by Ibn Majah (4105); classed as sahih by al-Albani.\nHence one of the supplications of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was asking Allah that this world should not be his main concern and goal.\nIt was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) rarely got up to leave a gathering before offering this supplication for his companions: “O Allah, grant us a share of fear of You that will prevent us from disobeying You, and a share of obedience and righteous deeds that will enable us to reach Your Paradise, and a share of certain faith that will enable us to bear the calamities of this world. Grant us the benefit of our hearing, sight and good health throughout our lives, and let us enjoy them until the last moment of our lives. Enable us to settle the scores with those who have wronged us, and grant us victory over those who oppose us. Do not let calamity befall us in our faith, do not let this world be our main concern or make it all that we know, and do not send against us those who will not show mercy to us.”\nNarrated by at-Tirmidhi (3502); classed as hasan by al-Albani.\n2. The second blameworthy thing is:\nwhen a person is seized by love of this world to the extent that he does not care whether he seeks worldly gain through halal means or haram.\nIt was narrated that Abu Umamah said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Jibril inspired to me that no soul will die until it has completed its allotted timespan and received its provision in full. So be moderate in seeking provision, and no one of you should let thinking that provision is slow in coming prompt him to seek it by sinful means, for what is with Allah cannot be attained except through obedience to Him”\nNarrated by Abu Nu‘aym in al-Hilyah (10/26) and others; classed as sahih by al-Albani.\nBased on these two points, being distracted by worldly concerns from the hereafter, and seeking worldly gain by whatever means are available, not caring whether they are halal or haram – this is how we should understand the warning against striving for worldly matters or praying for worldly matters.\nAbu Mu‘awiyah al-Aswad said: The one for whom this world is his main concern will suffer lengthy worry and distress in the hereafter.\nMaslamah ibn ‘Abd al-Malik said: Those who will feel the least distress in the hereafter are those who have the least worries and stress in this world.\nBoth reports were narrated by Ibn Abi’d-Dunya in Dhamm ad-Dunya (283, 284).\nConclusion: The wording mentioned in the question was not soundly narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and there is no sound report from him to suggest that it is not allowed to offer supplication for what is good in this world, so it is not correct to say that praying for what is good in this world will bring worries and stress.\nRather what has been narrated is a warning against being distracted by worldly concerns from the hereafter, or seeking worldly gains in ways that are not permissible.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/297658/does-pursuing-worldly-matters-cause-stress-and-worries
228612,"How can we raise the level of taqwa (fear of Allah, righteousness) in our hearts? I waste time watching television and playing games; what can I do?","[""Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nAllah, may He be glorified and exalted, has commanded us to fear Him (taqwa), and He has told us that taqwa is the key to success and prosperity in this world and the hereafter, as He, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{O you who have believed, fear Allah as He should be feared and do not die except as Muslims [in submission to Him]}\xa0[Al ‘Imran 3:102]\n{And whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger and fears Allah and is conscious of Him - it is those who are the attainers}\xa0[an-Nur 24:52].\nAnd He tells us that He, may He be glorified, is with those who fear Him:\n{Indeed, Allah is with those who fear Him and those who are doers of good}\xa0[an-Nahl 16:128]\n{but Allah is the protector of the righteous}\xa0[al-Jathiyah 45:19].\nAnd He tells us that the [best] outcome is for the righteous (those who fear Allah), as He says:\n{And the [best] outcome is for the righteous}\xa0[al-A‘raf 7:128].\nThey are those who will attain salvation and success in this world and the hereafter, as He says:\n{And We saved those who believed and used to fear Allah}\xa0[Fussilat 41:18].\nAnd He says:\n{Then We will save those who feared Allah}\xa0[Maryam 19:72]\n{Indeed, for the righteous is attainment}\xa0[an-Naba’ 78:31].\nThe righteous (those who fear Allah) among the believers are the allies or close friends of Allah:\n{Unquestionably, [for] the allies of Allah there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve,\nThose who believed and were fearing Allah}\xa0[Yunus 10:62-63].\nAnd there are many similar verses.\nSecondly:\nTaqwa (fearing Allah and being righteous) means doing what Allah has enjoined and refraining from what He has prohibited.\nOne of the things which will help a person to do that is reflecting on the matter of this world and the hereafter, and understanding the value of each of them. This understanding will inevitably prompt a person to strive to attain the bliss of paradise in the hereafter and salvation from the fire. Hence Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, tells us about paradise that it is {prepared for the righteous} [Al ‘Imran 3:133].\nOne of the things that will increase taqwa in people’s hearts is striving to obey Allah, may He be exalted, and do righteous deeds, because Allah will reward him for that with an increase in guidance and taqwa, which will help him to adhere to what Allah has enjoined and will open to him the gates of goodness and obedience, and Allah will make easy for him that which was not easy for him before. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And those who are guided - He increases them in guidance and gives them their righteousness}\xa0[Muhammad 47:17].\nOne of the means which help a person to increase his fear of Allah and attain taqwa is fasting a great deal, for Allah, may He be exalted, has ordained in fasting a special quality that helps a person to do acts of worship and obedience, and endears such acts to him. Hence Allah, may He be exalted, said regarding the obligation of fasting:\n{O you who have believed, decreed upon you is fasting as it was decreed upon those before you that you may become righteous}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:183].\nHence the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) enjoined it, emphasized it and told us that there is nothing like it in that regard. It was narrated that Abu Umamah said: I said: O Messenger of Allah, tell me of a good deed. He said: “You should fast, for there is nothing like it.” I said: O Messenger of Allah, tell me of [another] good deed. He said: “You should fast, for there is nothing like it.”\nNarrated by Ahmad (22149), an-Nasa’i (4/165) and others; classed as sahih by al-Albani.\nAnother thing that will help to strengthen taqwa in the heart is: striving to acquire the characteristics of the righteous who fear Allah, which Allah, may He be exalted, has mentioned in His book, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Righteousness is not that you turn your faces toward the east or the west, but [true] righteousness is [in] one who believes in Allah , the Last Day, the angels, the Book, and the prophets and gives wealth, in spite of love for it, to relatives, orphans, the needy, the traveler, those who ask [for help], and for freeing slaves; [and who] establishes prayer and gives zakah; [those who] fulfill their promise when they promise; and [those who] are patient in poverty and hardship and during battle. Those are the ones who have been true, and it is those who are the righteous}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:177]\n{And hasten to forgiveness from your Lord and a garden as wide as the heavens and earth, prepared for the righteous\nWho spend [in the cause of Allah] during ease and hardship and who restrain anger and who pardon the people - and Allah loves the doers of good -\nAnd those who, when they commit an immorality or wrong themselves [by transgression], remember Allah and seek forgiveness for their sins - and who can forgive sins except Allah? - and [who] do not persist in what they have done while they know.\nThose - their reward is forgiveness from their Lord and gardens beneath which rivers flow [in Paradise], wherein they will abide eternally; and excellent is the reward of the [righteous] workers}\xa0[Al ‘Imran 3:133-136].\nAnother thing that helps is adhering to the guidance and teachings of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and keeping away from innovations that have been introduced into the religion. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And, [moreover], this is My path, which is straight, so follow it; and do not follow [other] ways, for you will be separated from His way. This has He instructed you that you may become righteous}\xa0[al-An‘am 6:153].\nAnother thing that helps is keeping away from the things that Allah has prohibited, as He, may He be exalted, says:\n{These are the limits [set by] Allah, so do not approach them. Thus does Allah make clear His ordinances to the people that they may become righteous}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:187].\nAnother thing that helps is reflecting on the verses of Allah and His signs in the universe as He, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Indeed, in the alternation of the night and the day and [in] what Allah has created in the heavens and the earth are signs for a people who fear Allah}\xa0[Yunus 10:6]\n{And thus We have sent it down as an Arabic Qur'an and have diversified therein the warnings that perhaps they will avoid [sin] or it would cause them remembrance}\xa0[Ta-Ha 20:113].\nOther things that also help to strengthen taqwa in the heart include:\n\nRemembering Allah a great deal and reciting Qur’an.\nKeeping company with good people who offer sincere advice and reminders, and avoiding evil people and followers of innovation.\nReading biographies of those who feared Allah among the righteous believers, such as the scholars, the ascetics and devoted worshippers.\n\nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 14041 .\nSecondly:\nThe wise person should be prepared to meet Allah, may He be exalted, at any moment, for he does not know when death will come to him, after which he will not be able to make up for his shortcomings, and at that time he will feel regret at a time when regret will be to no avail.\nEach person will be questioned on the Day of Resurrection “about his life and how he spent it, and about his youth and how he used it.” Narrated by at-Tirmidhi (2416); classed as sahih by al-Albani.\nGood health and free time are among the blessings of Allah, may He be exalted, the value of which many people do not appreciate until after they lose them. Hence the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There are two blessings which many people fail to benefit from: good health and free time.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (6412).\nWhat is meant by “failing to benefit from them” is using his health and his free time in that which will not benefit him in this world or in the hereafter. This is true loss.\nThe wise person understands that he is going to be faced with a momentous matter, so it is essential that he prepares for it.\nAny effort made in obeying Allah in this world will lead to comfort and ease in the hereafter. Hence one of the early generations would push himself to strive hard in obeying Allah; the people advised him to rest, if only for a little while, and he said: “It is rest that I seek.” End quote from al-Fawa’id (p. 42).\nAny comfort and pleasure that results from disobeying Allah in this world will lead to regret and punishment, if Allah does not forgive the doer on the Day of Resurrection.\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/228612/how-can-we-strengthen-fear-of-allah-taqwa-in-our-hearts
