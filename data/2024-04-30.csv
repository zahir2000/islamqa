150788,"Is it permissible for the marriage contract to be done by a guardian who is more distantly related than the original guardian when the latter is available, due to social reasons?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nGuardianship with regard to marriage is a very serious matter, which Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has prescribed for His slaves to protect women and their rights, and to look after their interests. Therefore Islam does not allow the woman to be in charge of the marriage contract, whether for herself or for anyone else, and it does not allow her to choose her guardian for marriage or to appoint her own proxy. Rather there is a prescribed order of precedence, and it is not up to people to choose.\nAl-Bahuti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe father of a free woman is to be given precedence in arranging her marriage, because he has more insight into what is best for her and is more compassionate towards her. Next in order of precedence comes his proxy, meaning the proxy of the father who acts on his behalf in doing the marriage contract. Next in order of precedence comes the paternal grandfather or great-grandfather…, no matter how far the line of ascent reaches, the closest then the next closest, because he is an ancestor and is a male relative on the father’s side, so he is like the father. Then comes her son, then his son or grandson…, no matter how far the line of descent reaches, the closest then the next closest, because of the report narrated by Umm Salamah, which says that when her ‘iddah ended, the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) sent word to her, proposing marriage, but she said: O Messenger of Allah, none of my guardians are present. He said: “None of your guardians, present or absent, would disapprove of that.” So she said [to her son]: O ‘Umar, get up and give your mother in marriage to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and he did so. Narrated by an-Nasa’i. Next in order of precedence comes the woman’s brother through both parents (full brother), then her brother through the father (half-brother), as in the case of inheritance, then their sons or grandsons…, no matter how far the line of descent reaches. Precedence is given to sons and grandsons of her brothers who are connected to her through both parents over those who are connected to her only through the father, if they are equal in degree, the closest then the next closest. Then comes her paternal uncle who is a full brother to her father, then the paternal uncle who is a brother to her father through their father only, because of what is noted above. Then come the sons of the paternal uncles, according to what was mentioned above regarding inheritance. Then come the closest of male kin on the father’s side, as in the case of inheritance. The most entitled of the male kin after the brothers with regard to inheritance are the most entitled with regard to guardianship, because guardianship is based on compassion and seeking what is in the best interests of the woman under their guardianship, and that is achieved when there are ties of kinship. Then comes the master who has manumitted his slave, because he may inherit from her and is required to pay blood money on her behalf [if that is needed]. Then come the closest of the former master’s kin on his father’s side, in the same order of precedence as for inheritance. If there are no such relatives, next in order of precedence comes ties of wala’ as mentioned above, then the ruler – which refers to the leader or his deputy. Ahmad said: I prefer the judge to the governor in this matter. If none of them is available, then anyone with authority in the place where the woman lives may give her in marriage.""(Ar-Rawd al-Murbi‘\xa0 335-336).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThere are five categories of guardianship with regard to marriage: fathers, then sons, then brothers, then paternal uncles, then wala’. If they are all of the same degree of kinship, then precedence is given to the one who is most closely related, and the one who is most closely related is the one whose lineage meets with the lineage of the woman whose marriage is to be arranged before that of the other one. So the one who has a common ancestor within three generations is closer than the one who has a common ancestor within four, and so on. If they are of the same degree, then the one who has stronger ties takes precedence. So if there is a full brother and a brother through the father only, the full brother is the guardian.""(Ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘\xa0 12/84).\nSecondly:\nIt is essential to pay attention to the order of precedence between guardians, based on what has been noted above. Therefore it is not permissible to give precedence to the more distantly related guardian over the more closely related guardian with regard to doing the marriage contract.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf the more distantly related guardian gives her in marriage in the presence of the more closely related guardian, and if she agrees to him giving her in marriage without the permission of the more closely related guardian, then the marriage contract is not valid. This is the view of ash-Shafa‘i.\nMalik said: The marriage contract is valid, because he is a guardian and has the right to give her in marriage, with her permission, like the one who is more closely related.\nIn our view, this guardianship is based on being a male relative on the father’s side, and this cannot be allowed for one who is more distantly related when one who is more closely related is there, as in the case of inheritance.""(Al-Mughni (7/364); see also: al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah\xa0 33/90).\nAl-Bahuti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf a guardian who is more distantly related gives her in marriage, or a non-relative gives her in marriage, even the ruler, without there being any reason for the guardian who is more closely related not being able to be present, then the marriage is not valid, because the one who did the marriage contract on her behalf has no right to guardianship over her when the one who has the right to guardianship is present.""(Ar-Rawd al-Murbi‘\xa0 336).\nOne of the valid excuses which make it permissible to overlook the more closely related guardian for one who is more distantly related than him with regard to doing the marriage contract is if he is not qualified to do the marriage contract.\nAl-Hajawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Zad al-Mustaqni‘:\nIf the close relative refuses to give her in marriage (to a compatible suitor) or is not qualified to do that, or he is away travelling and cannot come except with difficulty and hardship, then a more distant relative may give her in marriage.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said in ash-Sharh:\nSaying that he is not qualified to be a guardian means that he is not qualified for that because he is a minor or an evildoer or is of a different religion and the like, because if the guardian is available but is not qualified, it is as if he is not there, because there is no benefit in his being available.""(Ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘\xa0 12/89).\nConclusion: it is not permissible for the more distantly related guardian to do the marriage contract when a more closely related guardian is present, unless there is a legitimate excuse which makes doing that permissible.\nIf the social reasons mentioned in the question prevent the more closely related guardian from doing the marriage contract – such as if he is incompetent or unable to do the right thing, or he is an evildoer, or other legitimate reasons – then it is permissible for the more distantly related guardian to do the marriage contract.\nBut if the social reasons have nothing to do with the impediments mentioned in Islamic teachings, then they carry no weight and it is not permissible to use that as an excuse to overlook the more closely related guardian and transgress his right to guardianship that Islam has granted to him.\nIf people need, for some reason, for the marriage contract to be done by a more distant relative, and the closer relative agrees to that, then the closer relative may appoint the more distant relative, or someone else who is qualified to do the marriage contract, as a proxy, even if he is not a guardian at all.\nThe scholars of the Permanent Committee were asked:\nSometimes a woman’s brother does the marriage contract for her, even if her father or grandfather is present, because he has delegated him to do that and has agreed to it. Is the marriage contract valid if it is done in this way? In other words, if a more distantly related guardian does the marriage contract even though a more closely related guardian is present, with his consent?\nThey replied:\nIf the more distantly related guardian of the woman does the marriage contract in the presence of the more closely related guardian, without a legitimate reason for the original guardian not to do it, and without him being appointed as a proxy by the more closely related guardian, then the marriage contract is invalid, and the marriage is not valid in this case, because he has no guardianship over the woman when the one who is entitled to guardianship, namely the more closely related guardian, is present.\nBut if the one who is entitled to do the marriage contract for the woman gives up the right to guardianship to one who is more distantly related than him, or he appoints as a proxy someone who is qualified to be a guardian to do the marriage contract for the woman under his care, it is permissible for him to do the marriage contract and the marriage is valid, because it is a right of his that he has given up to the one whom he has appointed as his proxy, so the latter takes his place.\nBased on that, it is permissible for the brother to do the marriage contract for his sister, if the guardian who is more entitled to do the marriage contract for her appointed him as his proxy and delegated him to do that.\nAnd Allah is the source of strength.

12338,I would like to know: my wife has gold jewelry which was given to her from mother but I am not well off and I am in debt also so how should I pay zakat on it?,"[""Praise be to Allah.Who pays Zakah on wife's gold?\nThe husband does not have to pay Zakah on the jewelry on his wife’s behalf, because the Zakah is only obligatory on the possessor of the wealth, and the possessor in this case is your wife, because she is the owner of the jewelry. So she has to pay Zakah on it, either from the jewelry itself or from its monetary value .\nIf her husband or someone else pays Zakah on her behalf with her permission, that is OK, and he will be rewarded for this voluntary action.\xa0\nCan the wife pay Zakah to her husband?\nIf the wife wants to give the Zakah on her jewelry or anything else to her husband who is in debt and cannot pay it off or who is poor, there is nothing wrong with that, because it comes under the general meaning of the verse (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“As-Sadaqat (here it means Zakah) are only for the poor, and the needy…” [At-Tawbah 9:60]\xa0\nIndeed, there is the hope that she will have a multiple reward, because of the Hadith narrated by Al-Bukhari (1466) and Muslim (1000) from Zaynab (may Allah be pleased with her), the wife of `Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: `Give in charity, O women, even if it is from your jewelry.’ I went back to `Abdullah and said, `You are a man who has little wealth, and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) has commanded us to give in charity. Go and ask him if that is acceptable, otherwise I will give my charity to someone else.’ `Abdullah said to me, `No, you go and ask him.’ So I went, and there I saw a woman from among the Ansar at the door of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), wanting to ask the same question. We felt too shy to speak to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Bilal came out to us and we said to him, `Go to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and tell him that there are two women at the door asking whether it is acceptable for them to give charity (Zakah) to their husbands and the orphans who are in their care, but do not tell him who we are.’ Bilal went in to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and asked him, and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked, `Who are they?’ He said, `A woman from among the Ansar and Zaynab.’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked, `Which Zaynab?’ He said, `The wife of `Abdullah.’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to him, ‘They will have two rewards, the reward of (upholding ties of) kinship and the reward of giving charity.’”\xa0\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “From this Hadith it may be understood that it is permissible for a woman to give Zakah to her husband. This is the view of Ash-Shafi`i, Ath-Thawri, the two companions of Abu Hanifah, one of the two reports narrated from Malik and from Ahmad.”\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12338/must-the-husband-pay-zakah-on-wifes-jewelry
257088,"Are artificial false lashes haraam? How do they fall under the ruling of extensions when they are not hair on your head and mascara is allowed which also lengthens? Also, we are allowed to dye and use black cosmetics on our eyelashes and not our hair so surely they fall under different categories. As for deception, in this case wouldn't all makeup be deception not just lashes?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nFalse eyelashes are used in two scenarios:\nThe first scenario is when they are worn to correct a deformity resulting from sickness or burns. This does not come under the heading of cosmetic procedures that are haram; rather it comes under the heading of remediating a defect.\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) gave permission [to one of his companions] to wear a nose made of gold, and he gave permission to change it [from a previous one made of silver] because it was by way of correcting a defect.\nAbu Dawud (4232), at-Tirmidhi (1770) and an-Nasa’i (5161) narrated from ‘Abd ar-Rahman ibn Tarafah that his grandfather ‘Arfajah ibn As‘ad had his nose cut off in the battle of al-Kulaab, and he wore a nose made of silver, but it began to stink, so the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) told him to get a nose made of gold. This hadith was classed as hasan by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud.\nAbu Dawud (4170) narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas said: The woman who does hair extensions and the woman for whom that is done, the woman who plucks eyebrows and the woman for whom that is done, the woman who does tattoos and the woman for whom that is done when there is no ailment (that would justify doing those things) are cursed.\nAhmad (3945) narrated that Ibn Mas‘ud said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbid plucking eyebrows, filing teeth, adding hair extensions and doing tattoos, except in the case of ailments.\nAsh-Shawkani (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The apparent meaning of the phrase “except in the case of ailments” indicates that the prohibition mentioned only applies in cases where these things are done for the purpose of beautification, and not as a remedy for an ailment or problem, in which case they are not haram.""(Nayl al-Awtar\xa0 6/229).\nThe second scenario is when the eyelashes are already there, and the false eyelashes are only worn for cosmetic reasons and enhancing beauty. This is forbidden for two reasons:\nFirstly: because that comes under the heading of hair extensions, which are prohibited.\nSecondly: because of the harm that results from applying these false eyelashes.\nIt says in Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa’imah (17/133): It is not permissible to use artificial nails, artificial eyelashes and coloured contact lenses, because of what that involves of causing harm to the place where these things are applied to the body, and because it also comes under the heading of deceit, trickery and changing the creation of Allah. End quote.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: What is the ruling on wearing false eyelashes for the purpose of beautifying oneself for one’s husband?\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) replied: False eyelashes are not permissible, because they are akin to hair extensions, which means adding to the hair on the head. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) cursed the woman who does hair extensions and the woman for whom that is done.\nIf these false eyelashes are as I imagine them to be now, where black threads like hair are placed on the eyelashes so that it looks as if they are thicker, to make the eyes look beautiful, then if that is the case, they come under the heading of hair extensions, concerning which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) cursed the woman who does that for the hair on her head.\nBut if what is meant is colouring the natural eyelashes (mascara), then it is not haram.""(Fatawa Nur ‘ala ad-Darb).\nShaykh Ibn Jibrin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: There are false eyelashes which are applied along the edge of the entire eyelid for those whose eyelashes are short, or they may be applied to part of the edge of the eyelid in areas where the lashes are short, and they are removed after the event, like any other kind of makeup. What is the ruling on that? Please advise us, may Allah reward you.\nHe replied: Eyelashes are the hair along the eyelids, which Allah, may He be exalted, has created to protect the eyes from dust and dirt. Hence the eyelashes are present from birth, and they are also found in most animals. They are hairs that are of a fixed length, and grow neither long nor short. If the eyelash is plucked, it grows back, but some people may feel pain in the eyelashes and need to pluck this area in order to reduce the pain.\nIf that is the case, then I think that it is not permissible to wear false eyelashes, because it comes under the heading of hair extensions. It is proven that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) cursed the woman who does hair extensions and the one who asks for that to be done. As he forbade adding extensions to the hair of the head, the same applies to the eyelashes. It is not permissible to add extensions to the eyelashes or to wear false eyelashes because the original eyelashes are short. Rather the woman should accept what Allah has decreed, and not do anything that involves deceit or fake beauty, for the one who pretends to have something that he does not have is like the one who wears two garments of falsehood. And Allah knows best.""(‘Ulama’ al-Balad al-Haram, p. 1209).\nDr. Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-‘Aziz al-Musnid said in his book Zinat al-Mar’ah bayna at-Tibb wa’sh-Shar‘ (p. 33): As for false eyelashes and substances that are used on the false eyelashes, doctors say that they are composed of nickel salts or some types of artificial rubber, which may cause infection of the eyelids and lead to loss of the eyelashes. End quote.\nThese false eyelashes are also not allowed for a third reason, which is deceit and trickery if they are worn for anyone other than the husband. In that case, they are the same as all other forms of deceit, even dyeing the hair.\nSecondly:\nWith regard to what the questioner mentioned about there being a difference between eyelashes and the hair on the head, in reality there is no difference between them, because it is permissible to use kohl on the eyelashes, which makes them grow longer, just as it is permissible to use henna, oils and olive oil on the hair on one’s head to make it grow long.\nDyeing the hair black it is only forbidden in the case of grey hair; it is not forbidden if there is no issue of grey hair.\nMost of the scholars say that false eyelashes come under the ruling on hair extensions. Some of them say that they are the same as hair extensions, and some of them say that they are akin to hair extensions, therefore they are subject to the same ruling. If we assume that the mention of hair extensions in the hadith refers to the hair on the head, then false eyelashes come under the same ruling by analogy with the hair.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/257088/false-eyelashes-come-under-the-same-ruling-as-hair-extensions
20325,We know from Hadith that the Angels do not enter into a house where pictures/photographs of living things (humans or animals) are displaced.,"[""Praise be to Allah.Types of image-making\nImage-making is of two types: one by hand and the other by means of machines.\xa0\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Image-making by hand is prohibited , and is in fact a major sin, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed the one who does it. He did not differentiate between images that have a shadow (i.e., three-dimensional) or those that are simply drawn (two-dimensional), according to the more correct scholarly opinion, because of the general meaning of the Hadith. \xa0\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 With regard to image-making by means of machines, i.e. cameras, there is a difference of opinion among the later scholars on this matter. Some of them forbid it and some of them allow it.\xa0\nIn order to be on the safe side, it is better to avoid that, because it is one of the doubtful areas. And whoever is careful with regard to doubtful matters will protect his religious commitment and his honour. But if he needs to do that for a specific purpose such as proving his identity, there is nothing wrong with that because if there is a need, the matter is no longer doubtful.\n\xa0Is keeping pictures prohibited in Islam?\xa0\nWith regard to keeping pictures , this is also of two types:\xa0\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The first type is keeping images that are three-dimensional. Keeping them is prohibited. Ibn Al-`Arabi (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated that there is consensus on this point. (See Fath Al-Bari, p. 388, vol. 10) He said: This consensus has to do with things other than girls’ dolls.\xa0\nIt was narrated that `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “I used to play with dolls in the presence of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and I had friends who would play with me. When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) entered they would hide themselves and he would call them to come and play with me.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, no. 5779; Muslim, no. 2440)\xa0\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The second type is images that are not three-dimensional. These are of different types:\xa0\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Those that are hung up to be venerated and respected , as in the case of pictures of kings, presidents, ministers, scholars etc. This is prohibited because it involves exaggeration about a created being.\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Those that are hung up for the sake of memory , such as hanging up pictures of one's friends. This is also prohibited, because of the Hadith narrated by Al-Bukhari from Abu Talhah (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: “I heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: `The angels do not enter any house in which there is a dog or an image.’” (Narrated by Muslim, 2104).\n3.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Those that are hung up for the purpose of adornment. These are also prohibited because of the Hadith of `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came back from a journey and I had hung a patterned curtain on which there were images over (the door of) a room of mine. When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw it, he tore it and said, `The most severely punished of the people on the Day of Resurrection will be those who tried to imitate the creation of Allah.’” She said: “So I made it into one or two cushions.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 5610; Muslim, 2107)\n4.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Those that are treated with disrespect, such as images in carpets and pillows. Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated from the majority of scholars among the Companions and Tabi’in that these are permissible.\n5.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Those that have unfortunately become widespread and are difficult to avoid, such as images engraved on coins etc which have become a problem for the Muslim ummah. It seems to me that there is no sin on the one who acquires these without wanting to acquire images.\nIs keeping children’s toys prohibited?\nAn exception is made in the case of children’s toys, which are not regarded as prohibited or disliked. But what are the toys which are exempted? We know that the toys of the past did not have eyes and lips and noses as they do nowadays. I think it is better to avoid these toys and limit oneself to those the kind of toys that were known previously.\xa0(See Fatawa Al-`Aqidah by Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin, p. 66, 663, 679)\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20325/is-keeping-pictures-prohibited-in-islam
