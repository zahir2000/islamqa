423101,"I invested some money with a trader in car parts. He lives in another country, and because it is difficult for him to keep accounts, we agreed on a way to conduct our business, which is as follows: he buys some items for me and for him from another country, then when my items are delivered to his store, he calls me on my cell and I sell my items to him with a certain margin of profit. What is the ruling on this transaction?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThere is nothing wrong with appointing someone to buy an item for you, then when the proxy buys it, you sell it to him for a profit. For the duration of the proxy period, the item is a trust that is kept with the proxy, and if it is damaged, he is not liable for it, unless he is the one who caused the damage or was negligent.\nSo if your proxy bought your item and brought it to his own city, it is permissible for you to sell it to him.\nBut [before you sell it to him] you must make sure that he did actually buy the item and that he received the item that still belongs to you, so that it will not be like a trick to get money from you and return it with something extra.\nThe basic principle is that the one who buys a thing should not sell it until he has taken possession of it. In this case, when the proxy receives the item it is like the one who appointed him receiving it. So what actually happens is that he appoints the proxy to buy and receive the item, then after that the transaction between them is done face-to-face or over the phone.\nIn the statements and advice of the Islamic Fiqh Council, statement no. 52 (3/6) it says:\nIf there is a deal between two parties at the same time, when they are far apart in distance – and this is applicable to transactions done over the phone and wireless communications – then the deal between them is to be regarded as being like a deal between two people that is done face-to-face.\nSecondly:\nThere is nothing wrong with two people buying an item together as partners, with one of them promising the other that he will sell him his share after taking possession of it. So once they buy the item, one of them will sell his share, based on the market price. This is what is called a reduced-number partnership, in which the following conditions are stipulated:\n1. It should not be stipulated that you will buy the item from the other partner.\n2. It should not be a binding promise.\n3. There should be no promise to buy the partner’s share on the basis of its value at the time of forming the partnership, because that is guaranteeing to buy the partner’s share. Rather the sale should be at the market price at the time of the transaction.\nIt says in a statement of the Islamic Fiqh Council: The reduced-number partnership is permissible if it follows the general rulings on partnerships and attention is paid to the following guidelines:\na.. There should be no promise from either party to buy the share of the other for the value of the share at the time of forming the partnership, because that is guaranteeing the share of the partner. Rather the price should be determined based on the market value on the day of the transaction, or as is agreed when the transaction is done. End quote.\nIt says in al-Ma‘ayir ash-Shar ‘iyyah (p. 206): It is essential that when forming the partnership, there should be no stipulated conditions of buying and selling. Rather the partner may make a promise to that effect that is separate from the partnership. Similarly, the buying and selling should be done in a transaction that is independent of the partnership deal, and it is not permissible for one of the transactions to be mentioned are stipulated in the other.

138009,"When we say “As-salamu `Alaykum wa rahmat-Allah” at the end of the prayer, to whom are we saying that? Are we saying it to the angels who are present on our right and on our left, or are we saying it to the people on our right and on our left?","['Praise be to Allah.Taslim is one of the pillars of prayer\nThe Taslim or Salam at the end of the prayer is one of its pillars or essential parts, and one cannot end or exit from the prayer without saying it.\xa0\nAbu Dawud (61) and At-Tirmidhi (3) narrated from `Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The key to prayer is purification, its start is the Takbir (saying Allahu Akbar) and its exit is the Taslim (saying the Salam).” (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sunan Abu Dawud)\xa0\nThis is the view of a number of scholars, including the Imams Malik, Ash-Shafi`i and Ahmad.\xa0\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Our view is that it is obligatory, one of the pillars (essential parts) of prayer without which it is not valid. This is the view of the majority of scholars among the Companions, Successors and those who came after them. (End quote from Al-Majmu`, 3/462)\xa0\nWhy do we say Salam at the end of prayer?\nWhen saying the Salam, the worshipper should intend to exit the prayer and say Salam upon the Imam and those to his right and his left, and to the recording angels.\xa0\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“When saying the Salam, the Imam should intend the first Salam as an exit from the prayer and a greeting to those who are on his right and upon the recording angels, and he should intend the second Salam as a greeting to those on his left and the recording angels. The one who is praying behind him should intend the first Salam as an exit from the prayer and as a greeting to the Imam, the recording angels and the worshippers in his vicinity, in his row and behind him and in front of him, and he should intend the second Salam as a greeting to the worshippers in his vicinity, and if the Imam is in front of him, he should intend his two Salams to be greetings to him too.\xa0\nThe one who is praying alone should intend his first Salam as an exit from the prayer and a greeting to the recording angels, and the second Salam as a greeting to the recording angels. The basic principle in his case is that which was narrated by Samurah ibn Jundub (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed us to send Salams upon ourselves and to greet one another with Salam…\xa0\nIf he intends to exit the prayer and does not intend anything else, that is permissible because saying Salam to those who are present is Sunnah.” (End quote from Al-Majmu`, 3/456)\nMuslim (431) narrated that Jabir ibn Samurah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: When we prayed with the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) we used to say, As-salamu `Alaykum wa rahmat-Allah, As-salamu `alaykum wa rahmat-Allah (Peace be upon you and the mercy of Allah), and he gestured with his hand to either side. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Why do you gesture with your hands as if they were the tails of restive horses? Rather it is sufficient for one of you to put his hand on his thigh then say Salams to his brothers to his right and left.”\xa0\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“The words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), “then say Salams to his brothers to his right and left” refer to his fellow worshippers who are present on his right on his left. (End quote)\xa0\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“He should intend when saying the Salam, to exit the prayer; if he also intends alongside that to respond to the two angels and to those who are behind him, if he is the Imam, or to the Imam and the other people with him, if he is a member of the congregation, there is nothing wrong with that. This was stated by Ahmad who said: He may say the Salam at the end of the prayer, intending thereby to respond to the Imam.” End quote from Al-Mughni, 1/326-327)\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“If it is asked: upon whom are Salams being sent?\xa0\nThe answer is that they said: If there is a group of others with him, then the Salam is upon them; if there is no group with him, then the Salam is upon the angels who are on his right and his left, so he says: As-salamu `alaykum wa rahmat-Allah. (End quote from Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti`, 3/208)\xa0\nTo sum up, when saying the Salam at the end of the prayer, the worshipper intends three things:\xa0\n\nTo exit the prayer\nTo send Salams upon the recording angels\nTo send Salams upon his fellow-worshippers.\n\nIf he is praying alone, then he intends when saying the Salam to exit the prayer and send Salams upon the recording angels.\xa0\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 105297 , 69819 , 125897 , and 138666 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/138009/why-do-we-say-salam-at-the-end-of-prayer
423108,"I gave some money to a trader to use it in doing business, and he will give me a small amount every month. I am not saving any of it, as I have commitments and many expenses each month, and I have no money left at the end of the month. Is zakah due on the capital that I gave to the trader to do business with it?","['Praise be to Allah.Zakah is due on cash money, such as Egyptian pounds, if it reaches the minimum threshold (nisab) by itself, which is equivalent to 595 grams of silver.\nIf the money is invested in business, the zakah must be given every time a (Hijri) year passes since taking possession of the capital; that does not change when the money is invested in the business.\nIt says in Zad al-Mustaqni‘ (p. 87): If he buys trade goods with currency [that is, gold or silver] that reaches the minimum threshold, then the year for the trade goods (for zakah purposes) begins from the time when he acquired that currency. End quote.\nSo if someone acquired 10,000 pounds, for example, on the first day of Ramadan, then he used it in Muharram to buy goods to sell, the year for zakah on the trade goods begins on the first of Ramadan, so he should work out the value of the goods on the first day of the following Ramadan, based on the market price, and he should note what his share of the trade goods and of the available cash is, then give zakah on it.\nTherefore the equation for working out zakah is as follows:\nThe market value of the goods + the amount of available cash + any debts owed to you that you expect to collect. Then you should give 2.5% (one quarter of one tenth) of the total as zakah.\nThe scholars of the Permanent Committee were asked (9/356): I have fifteen thousand riyals, which I gave to a man to do business with it in return for half of the profit. Is zakah due on this money? On what should I give the zakah – the capital, the profit, or both? If zakah is due on the capital, and I used the capital to buy specific items, such as carpets, furniture and the like, what is the ruling in this case?\nThey replied: Zakah is due on the money mentioned, which was allocated for the purpose of trade, when one (Hijri) year has passed since acquiring it. Zakah must be given on both the capital and the profits at the end of the zakah year. If trade goods were bought with the money, then their value should be worked out at the end of the zakah year, based on the market price at that time, then zakah must be given at the rate of two and a half percent (2.5%) of the total amount of the wealth and the profit. End quote.\nShaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn ‘Abdillah ibn Baz, Shaykh ‘Abd ar-Razzaq ‘Afifi, Shaykh ‘Abdullah ibn Ghadyan.\nShaykh Salih al-Fawzan (may Allah preserve him) was asked: I have some money, seven thousand Egyptian pounds, which I put into a commercial investment project. Is zakah due on it? What is the rate, and to whom should I give it? Should I give zakah on the capital only, or on the capital and the profit?\nHe replied: Money that is invested in business is subject to zakah, if it reaches the minimum threshold (nisab) or more. It must be given on the profit as well, because the profit is connected to the capital, so zakah must be given on both. So you have to give zakah on this wealth when one (Hijri) year has passed. The profit should be added to it, then zakah must be given on the total at a rate of one quarter of one tenth… End quote from al-Muntaqa min Fatawa ash-Shaykh al-Fawzan.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/423108/he-invested-his-money-in-business-with-someone-does-he-have-to-give-zakah-on-both-the-capital-and-the-profit-and-how-should-he-give-it
21434,"What is the reward parents receive for being patient and thanking Allah, when they have an infant or child die?","['Praise be to Allah.Virtue of patience in Islam\nThere are many texts in the Quran and Sunnah which point to the virtue and great reward of those who are patient and state that Allah will give them reward without measure. This includes everyone who bears with patience any calamity with which he is tested.\xa0\nReward for losing a child in Islam\nUndoubtedly the loss of a child is one of the greatest calamities for the one whom it befalls. Whoever bears that with patience and accepts the will and decree of Allah will have a great reward by the grace and bounty of Allah. There follow some of these texts, which we hope will be of consolation to you in your time of calamity :\xa0\nAllah says (interpretation of the meanings):\xa0\n\n{And We will surely test you with something of fear and hunger and a loss of wealth and lives and fruits, but give good tidings to the patient * Who, when disaster strikes them, say, ""Indeed we belong to Allāh, and indeed to Him we will return. * Those are the ones upon whom are blessings from their Lord and mercy. And it is those who are the [rightly] guided.} [Al-Baqarah 2:155-157]\n{ … And Allah loves the steadfast.} [Al `Imran 3:146]\xa0\n{ Indeed, the patient will be given their reward without account [i.e., limit].} [Az-Zumar 39:10]\n\nAnd there are many similar verses.\xa0\nThere are also many Hadiths, including the following:\xa0\nMuslim (5318) narrated that Suhayb said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “How wonderful is the affair of the believer, for his affair is all good, and this applies to no one except the believer. If something good happens to him, he gives thanks and that is good for him, and if something bad happens to him, he bears it with patience, and that is good for him.” This has to do with the virtues of patience in general.\xa0\nHadiths on losing a child\nThere are also Hadiths which speak specifically of losing a child . For example:\xa0\n\nAt-Tirmidhi (942) narrated that Abu Sinan said: I buried my son Sinan and Abu Talhah Al-Khulani was sitting at the graveside. When I wanted to go out he took my hand and said, “Shall I not give you some glad tidings, O Abu Sinan?” I said, “Yes.” He said, “Ad-Dahhak ibn `Abd Ar-Rahman ibn `Arzab narrated to me from Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When a person’s child dies, Allah says to His angels, ‘You have taken the child of My slave.’ They say, ‘Yes.’ He says, ‘You have taken the apple of his eye.’ They say, ‘Yes.’ He says, ‘What did My slave say?’ They say, ‘He praised you and said “Inna lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji`un (Verily to Allah we belong and unto Him is our return).’ Allah says, ‘Build for My slave a house in Paradise and call it the house of praise.’”\xa0(Classed as sound by Al-Albani in As-Silsilah As-Sahihah, 1408)\xa0\nThere is a special reward for the person whose child dies but he bears that with patience and hopes for reward. It was narrated from Abu Sa`id (may Allah be pleased with him) that the women said to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Give us a day (to teach us),” So he preached to them and said, “Any woman who loses three of her children, they will be a shield for her against the Fire.” A woman said, “And two?” He said, “And two.”\xa0(Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 99 and Muslim, 4786)\xa0\nAccording to a report narrated by Al-Bukhari (1292), Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no Muslim who loses three of his children before they reach the age of puberty, but Allah will admit him to Paradise by virtue of His Mercy towards them.”\xa0\nThese Hadiths explain that if two or more of a person’s children die and he bears that with patience, then he is promised Paradise and salvation from the Fire.\xa0\nOur Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught us a Du`a to say at times of calamity, in which there is virtue and great reward. Muslim (1525) narrated that Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say, “There is no Muslim who is afflicted with a calamity and says that which Allah has enjoined, Inna lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji’oon. Allahumma ajirni fi musibati wakhluf li khayran minha (Verily to Allah we belong and unto Him is our return. O Allah, reward me for my calamity and compensate me with something better than it), but Allah will compensate him with something better than it.” She said, When Abu Salamah died, I said, who among the Muslims is better than Abu Salamah, the first household to migrate to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)? Then I said these words, and Allah compensated me with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).\xa0\n\nWe ask Allah to bless you with patience in the face of your loss, and to compensate you with something better.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21434/reward-in-islam-for-one-who-loses-a-child
