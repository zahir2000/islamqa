194052,There is a factory that produces chicken and pork. What is the ruling on eating the chicken from this factory – is it halal?,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIn order for chicken and other meats to be halal, there are two conditions:\nThe first condition:\nThe slaughterer must be qualified, meaning that he should be a Muslim or one of the People of the Book, i.e., a Jew or a Christian). Meat slaughtered by an idol-worshipper, atheist or apostate is not permissible.\nThe second condition:\nThe chicken should be slaughtered in a place for slaughter, and it should not be killed by means of an electric shock, beating or drowning in water, because that is prohibited in the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Prohibited to you are dead animals,\xa0blood, the flesh of swine, and that which has been dedicated to other than Allah, and [those animals] killed by strangling or by a violent blow or by a head-long fall or by the goring of horns, and those from which a wild animal has eaten, except what you [are able to] slaughter [before its death], and those which are sacrificed on stone altars}\xa0[al-Ma’idah 5:3].\nAl-Hajjawi said in al-Iqna‘ (4/316): There are several conditions that are stipulated for slaughter:\n1.. The slaughterer should be qualified, which means that he should be of sound mind and intending to slaughter the animal in the proper manner. He should be a Muslim or one of the People of the Book (i.e., a Jew or a Christian), even if he is one whose people are in a state of war with the Muslims or one of the Christians of Banu Taghlib; male or female, free or slave, even if he or she is junub, menstruating, bleeding following childbirth or blind, of good character or otherwise.\nIt is more appropriate if the slaughterer is a Muslim rather than a Jew or a Christian.\nMeat is not permissible if it is slaughtered by a person one of whose parents is a disbeliever who is not one of the People of the Book. Meat is also not permissible if it is slaughtered by an apostate, even if he joined the religion of the People of the Book; or if it is slaughtered by a Zoroastrian, an idol worshipper or a heretic. The same applies to the Druze, the Isma‘ilis and the Nusayris of Syria…\n2.. The tool used for slaughter should be sharp, cutting and penetrating by virtue of its sharpness, not its weight, whether it is made of iron, stone, wood, reeds, bone or anything else, except teeth and nails…\n3.. The throat – meaning the windpipe – and the oesophagus – which is the passage for food and drink – must be cut, but if they are cut completely, that is better.\nThe more correct view is that it is not stipulated to cut the veins on both sides of the throat, but it is better to cut them. End quote.\nSecondly\nIf the factory produces pork products, and also produces chicken products, the matter is subject to further discussion:\n1.. If it produces whole chickens or parts such as legs and breasts, and the one in charge of slaughter is a Muslim, or a Jew or a Christian, then there is nothing wrong with buying chicken from them, because it is most likely that the chicken is not mixed with the pork, and the tools used for slaughter are kept separate.\n2.. But if it produces ground chicken meat or canned chicken meat, if it is known that the same equipment is used to produce pork products, then it is haram to eat this chicken, because it is impure as a result of using equipment that is contaminated with pork, unless it is possible to wash it and purify it, in which case the chicken is permissible.\nUndoubtedly it is better to completely avoid chicken that is produced in factories like this which also produce pork products, especially if we cannot find out what they really do in the factory, and the supervising authorities are not certain about their slaughtering procedures and the extent to which they adhere to Islamic rulings on slaughter.\nThe scholars of the Permanent Committee were asked:\nSome restaurants grill beef on the same hotplate as pork. Is it permissible to eat that meat? Similarly, they use the same knife to cut the meat.\nThey replied: It is not permissible to eat beef that is grilled on the same hotplate as pork. The same applies to the knife.""(Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah\xa0 22/285).\nThey were also asked:\nSometimes I eat in the student restaurant. Of course I avoid haram foods, but sometimes I order fried potato or fried eggs, and one time I saw the woman who cooks the food frying eggs in the same oil with meat. I do not know what the meat was, but I am almost certain that it was pork. Is it haram to eat the eggs and potatoes?\nThey replied: If you are certain that some food is fried in the same ghee or oil in which pork was fried before, then do not eat it, otherwise it is permissible for you to eat it.""(Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah\xa022/283).\nFor more information, please see the answers to questions no.\xa0148426 \xa0and\xa062839 \xa0.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/194052/is-it-permissible-to-buy-chicken-from-a-factory-that-produces-pork
76115,Does touching a non-mahram woman invalidate wudu? Please mention the different scholarly opinions on that.,"['Praise be to Allah.The scholars differed as to whether Wudu is invalidated by touching a woman . There are three views:\xa0\n\nThe first view is that touching a woman invalidates Wudu in all cases, whether the touching is with desire or not, and whether he intended to do that or it happened by mistake. This is the view of Imam Ash-Shafi`i (may Allah have mercy on him).\xa0\n\nHe quoted as evidence the verse (interpretation of the meaning): “or you have been in contact with [Lamastum] women” [An-Nisa’ 4:43].\xa0\nThe basic meaning of the word lamas (translated here as “been in contact with”) is touching with the hand.\xa0\nThe word “Lamas” appears in Hadiths with the meaning of touching with the hand, as in the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to Ma’iz (may Allah be pleased with him): “Perhaps you kissed her or touched (Lamasta) her.” (Narrated by Ahmad in Al-Musnad, 2130)\xa0\nAnd he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The Zina of the hand is touching (Al-lams).” (Narrated by Ahmad, 8392 and classed as authentic by Al-Albani in As-Silsilah As-Sahihah, 8204).\xa0\nBut these Hadiths indicate that what is meant by touching is that which is less than intercourse, and there is no dispute concerning this. Rather the dispute is whether the “touching” mentioned in the verse refers to intercourse or that which is less than it. These Hadiths do not refer to any such thing. \xa0\nThis opinion is the weakest of the scholarly views on this matter. Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said, as is mentioned in Al-Ikhtiyarat (p. 18): “If he touches a woman without desire, then it is well known that the Lawgiver does not require him to do Wudu and it is not recommended for him to do Wudu.”\xa0\n\nThe second view is that touching a woman does not invalidate Wudu  at all, whether it is with desire or without desire. This is the view of Imam Abu Hanifah (may Allah have mercy on him).\xa0\n\nThis view is indicated by a number of things:\xa0\n\nThe basic principle is that purity (Taharah) remains valid and is not invalidated unless there is sound evidence that this thing invalidates Wudu, and there is no such evidence in this case. As for the verse, `e shall see below that what it refers to is intercourse, not just touching.\nIt was narrated that `A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: I used to sleep in front of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and my legs would be in the direction of his Qiblah. When he prostrated, he would poke me and I would draw my legs up and when he stood up I would stretch them out again. (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 382). In An-Nasa’i (166) it says with an authentic chain of narrators: until, when he wanted to pray Witr, he touched me with his leg.\nIt was also narrated that she (may Allah be pleased with her) said: I noticed that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was not in the bed one night, so I looked for him, and my hand fell on the sole of his foot. He was in the mosque, with his feet held upright, and he was saying, “O Allah, I seek refuge in Your pleasure from Your wrath, in Your forgiveness from Your punishment.” (Narrated by Muslim, 486). According to a report narrated by Al-Bayhaqi with an authentic chain of narrators: I started to reach out for him with my hand and my hand fell on his feet, and they were held upright and he was prostrating… It is also narrated by An-Nasa’i (169).\xa0\n\nThe apparent meaning of these Hadiths is undoubtedly that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) touched `A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) when he was praying, and if touching a woman invalidates Wudu then his Wudu and prayer would have been invalidated. The Shafi’is responded to these Hadiths with a weak argument, and said that perhaps it was from behind a barrier!\xa0\nAl-Shawkani said: This argument is far-fetched and it goes against the apparent meaning.\xa0\n\nIt was also narrated from her (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) kissed one of his wives, then he went out to pray and he did not do Wudu. (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 179 and classed as authentic by Ibn Jarir, Ibn ‘Abd Al-Barr and Az-Zayla`i, and by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud).\n\nIt was also classed as inauthentic by many, including Sufyan Ath-Thawri, Yahya ibn Sa`id Al-Qattan, Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Ad-Daraqutni, Al-Bayhaqi and An-Nawawi.\xa0\nIf this Hadith is authentic, then it is very clear evidence for this opinion. If it is inauthentic, then there is no need for it as there are the authentic Hadiths quoted above, and the principle still stands that purification remains valid, and there is no evidence that Wudu is invalidated by touching a woman.\xa0\n\nThe third view is that it depends.\xa0If the touching was done with desire, then it invalidates Wudu, and if it was not done with desire then it does not invalidate it. This is the view of the Malikis and Hanbalis. They tried to reconcile between the texts, namely the verse “or you have been in contact with [Lamastum] women” which\xa0 indicates that Wudu is invalidated by touching a woman in their opinion, and the Hadiths which were quoted as evidence by those who think that it does not invalidate Wudu.\xa0\n\nThis argument may be valid if the verse indicates that Wudu is invalidated by touching in general – which is their opinion, but the correct view is that what is referred to in the verse is intercourse, as was explained by `Abdullah ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him), a view which was favoured by Ibn Jarir. His Tafsir takes precedence over the Tafsir of others, because of the Du`a’ of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when he prayed for him and said: “O Allah, grant him understanding of the deen and teach him understanding (of the Qur’an).” (Narrated by Ahmad; it is also narrated in Al-Bukhari. It was classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Tahqiq At-Tahhawiyyah.\xa0See also: Mahasin Al-Ta’wil by Al-Qasimi, 5/172).\xa0\nIntercourse is referred to by the word mass (touching) in more than one verse. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“There is no sin on you, if you divorce women while yet you have not touched (had sexual relation with) them, nor appointed unto them their Mahr (bridal-money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage).” [Al-Baqarah 2:236]\xa0\n“And if you divorce them before you have touched (had a sexual relation with) them, and you have appointed unto them the Mahr (bridal-money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage), then pay half of that (Mahr).” [Al-Baqarah 2:237]\xa0\n“O you who believe! When you marry believing women, and then divorce them before you have sexual intercourse with them, no `Iddah [divorce prescribed period] have you to count in respect of them. So give them a present, and set them free (i.e. divorce) in a handsome manner.” [Al-Ahzab 33:49]\xa0\nMoreover, upon deeper study the verse does indicate this view (that what is meant by touching here is intercourse). The reason for that is:\xa0\n“That Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \xa0\n“O you who believe! When you intend to offer As-Salah (the prayer), wash your faces and your hands (forearms) up to the elbows, rub (by passing wet hands over) your heads, and (wash) your feet up to the ankles.” [Al-Ma’idah 5:6]\nThis refers to purification with water from minor impurity. Then He says (interpretation of the meaning): “But if you are ill or on a journey, or any of you comes after answering the call of nature, or you have been in contact with [lamastum]women (i.e. sexual intercourse), and you find no water, then perform Tayammum with clean earth”. The word Fatayammamu (perform Tayammum) is an alternative. The words “or any of you comes after answering the call of nature” refer to the cause for minor impurity and the words “or you have been in contact with [lamastum]women” refer to the cause for major impurity. \xa0\nIf we interpret “touching” as referring to touching with the hand, then the verse would mean that Allah mentioned two reasons for doing minor purification, and did not state any reason for doing major purification, even though He says “If you are in a state of Janaba (i.e. after a sexual discharge), purify yourselves (bathe your whole body)”. This is incompatible with the eloquence of the Qur’an.\xa0\nBased on this, the verse indicates that what is meant by “or you have been in contact with [lamastum] women” is: if you have had intercourse, so Allah mentions the two reasons that make it obligatory to purify oneself.” (Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti`, 1/240)\xa0(See also: Al-Bada’i` was-Sana’i`, 1/132; Al-Fiqh Al-Maliki, 1/89; and Al-Majmu`, 2/21)\nThe most correct of these three views is the second one, that touching a woman does not invalidate Wudu at all, whether it is with desire or without desire.\xa0\nThis is the view favoured by Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (12/222), and among contemporary scholars by Shaykh Ibn Baz (10/134), Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (1/286) and the scholars of the Standing Committee (5/266).\nFor more, see these answers: 12801 , 82759 , 8531 , 21242 , and 191686 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/76115/does-touching-a-woman-invalidate-wudu
503221,What is the ruling on believing that the divine attributes – such as the Quran or other divine attributes – could benefit or harm?,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nDivine attributes that are isolated [in a person’s mind] from the divine Essence can neither bring benefit nor cause harm. Whoever believes that they can bring benefit or cause harm in and of themselves has gone against Islamic teachings and reason.\nWe have previously explained that in the case of a divine attribute that is isolated [in a person’s mind] from the divine Essence, we cannot call upon that attribute on its own, or seek refuge with it. Calling upon the attribute in isolation [of the divine Essence] constitutes shirk, according to the consensus of the Muslims.\nSecondly:\nThe attributes of Allah, may He be exalted, are part of His Essence and cannot be separated from it. Hence the one who seeks refuge in the might of Allah, may He be exalted, or in His words has sought refuge with Allah, Who possesses the attributes of might and speech. So there is a difference between calling upon the attribute and calling upon Allah by virtue of the attribute, and between seeking refuge with the attribute and seeking refuge with the One Who possesses this attribute.\nIf someone says: However, since the Quran benefits the one who reads it and will intercede for its companions, this is true and is proven in the religious texts. But that is not because the attribute can bring benefit by itself; rather it is because Allah, may He be exalted, has put benefit and blessing in His words. Therefore the one who reads His words will be rewarded, and the one who seeks healing from them will be healed, and so on, and that has been proven, such as the fact that the Quran will come on the Day of Resurrection to intercede for its companions.\nSo the Quran may bring benefit in two ways: because it is the word of Allah, and the benefit comes from Allah, Who uttered it; or because the Quran is a means which Allah has made to be beneficial, so the benefit in its entirety is from Him, may He be blessed and exalted.\nThe Quran is the word of Allah and is not created. In other words, Allah, may He be exalted, uttered it, so it is one of His attributes. But people may assume things that are not possible, and think that the words are something separate that Allah did not say. In that case, whoever believes that the words on their own may bring benefit or cause harm by themselves has disbelieved. He has said something that is impossible, because the attribute can only exist in the one to whom it is ascribed. There is no such thing as words that exist by themselves; rather they are the words of Allah or the words of Zayd or ‘Amr. There is no such thing as knowledge that stands by itself or mercy that stands by itself; rather the attributes exist in the one to whom they are ascribed.\nShaykh ‘Abd ar-Rahman al-Barrak (may Allah preserve him) said: Calling upon the attribute is not mentioned in the supplications that are narrated in the religious texts, and that cannot be something that is prescribed or permissible, because calling upon the attribute – such as saying “O mercy of Allah, O might of ALlah, O power of Allah” – implies that the attribute is something separate and independent of Allah, and that it can hear and respond. Whoever believes that is a disbeliever. Rather the attributes of Allah exist in Him, and none of them is a god that can be called upon. In fact, Allah with His attributes, is one God, and He is the one to be called upon and the one in Whom we should put our trust; He is the only one to be worshipped, and there is no god worthy of worship except Him.

219227,"The iqamah for `Asr prayer was given after I had finished the second circuit of Tawaf when I did `umrah, so I prayed `Asr, then after praying I was not able to continue Tawaf because of the crowds, so I left with my family, and I came back the next day and did seven circuits of Tawaf around the Ka`bah to replace the five circuits of Tawaf from the previous day.","['Praise be to Allah.Is doing the Tawaf\xa0 circuits consecutively Essential?\nDoing the Tawaf\xa0 circuits consecutively is a condition of it being valid, according to the most correct scholarly view. However, a brief interruption between them does not matter.\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“One of the conditions of Tawaf being valid is continuity between its circuits.” (Al-Liqa’ Ash-Shahri, 3/205)\xa0\nInterruption of Tawaaf for Prayer\nIf the Iqamah for prayer is given when you are doing Tawaf , then you should pray, then complete Tawaf from where you left off in order to pray.\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“If the Iqamah for prayer is given whilst you are doing Tawaf , whether it is Tawaf for `Umrah or for Hajj or a voluntary Tawaf, then you should interrupt your Tawaf and pray, then go back and complete your Tawaf. You do not have to start all over again; rather you may complete your Tawaf from where you left off, and there is no need to start the circuit over again, because what you did previously was based on a sound foundation, and it is allowed to interrupt it for the prayer, so it cannot be invalid.” (Fatawa Nur `ala Ad-Darb, 12/2)\xa0\nShaykh Salih Al-Fawzan (may Allah preserve him) said:\xa0\n“One of the conditions of Tawaf being valid is that there should be continuity between the circuits, and one should also persist in doing a single circuit until it is complete. However it is permissible, when there is a valid excuse, interrupting that continuity , such as if the Iqamah for prayer is given when a person is doing Tawaf. In that case he should pray, then when he has said the Taslim, he should do the remaining circuits of Tawaf, carrying on from where he left off. The same applies if he feels tired during a circuit, and he rests briefly, then continues. There is nothing wrong with that, in sha Allah, because it is for a valid reason. But if he interrupts that continuity when there is no need to do so – for example, if there is a lengthy interruption between circuits – then in that case it is essential to start Tawaf all over again, because he did not fulfill the condition of continuity between circuits , with no valid reason.” (Al-Muntaqa min Fatawa Al-Fawzan, 67/1)\xa0\nBased on the above, what you did of repeating Tawaf in full, with seven circuits, on the second day, was the right thing to do and was what was required of you, because you did not complete the first Tawaf within a reasonable time, and you left a lengthy interruption between the two Tawafs. So it would not have been correct to try to complete the first one by basing the circuits on the second day on it.\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\xa0\nA man did two circuits of Tawaf, but because of the crowds he came out of Tawaf and rested for an hour or two, then he went back to do Tawaf again. Should he start all over again or complete his Tawaf from where he left off?\xa0\nHe replied:\n“If the interruption was lengthy, such as one or two hours, then what he must do is repeat his Tawaf. But if the interruption was brief, it does not matter. That is because with regard to Tawaf and Sa`i, it is essential that there be continuity, which means doing the circuits (or laps) one after another. If there is a lengthy interruption between circuits, then the first circuits are rendered invalid, and he has to start Tawaf all over again. But if the interruption is not lengthy, such as if he sits down for two or three minutes, then gets up and completes it, that does not matter.” (Majmu` Fatawa wa Rasa’il Al-`Uthaymin, 22/293)\xa0\nRecommended books on Hajj and `Umrah\nSome useful books that explain the rulings on Hajj and `Umrah are the following:\xa0\n\nAt-Tahqiq wal-Idah li Kathir min Masa’il Al-Hajj wal-`Umrah waz-Ziyarah by Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him)\nManasik Al-Hajj wal-`Umrah by Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him)\nAl-Minhaj fi Yawmiyat Al-Hajj by Shaykh `Abdullah ibn Jibrin (may Allah have mercy on him)\nAwdah Al-Masalik ila Ahkam Al-Manasik by Shaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn Muhammad As-Salman (may Allah have mercy on him)\nTabsir An-Nasik bi Ahkam Al-Manasik by Shaykh `Abd Al-Muhsin Al-`Abbad\xa0\n\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/219227/is-doing-the-tawaf-circuits-consecutively-essential
