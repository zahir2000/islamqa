246650,"I have a business venture, and I want to find out whether the way I am doing this transaction is permissible, because I researched the issue of salam transaction (payment in advance for delivery later on) and istisna‘ (contract to have something made or done) and selling something that one does not possess, but I do not know which ruling my venture comes under. My business idea is as follows: 1/ I design something with the cooperation of more than one party, on the basis that the other parties will share the profits in return for working with me. 2/ I send the design to a company that prints designs on clothing. 3/ I get one sample of the product printed. 4/ I show a picture of the sample product on the Internet, with specifications and dimensions. 5/ The customer sees the product on the Internet. 6/ The customer sends an order to us, with full payment covering the cost of the product + profit and shipping costs, and we tell the customer how long it will take to make and send it: between 5-10 days, depending on the manufacturing and shipping companies. 7/ After that, I will send the order to the printing company and pay the costs of the product, after deducting the profit. 8/ After producing the item, the company will send it to the customer; in other words I do not own the item of clothing; rather I show one sample that was made, which came into my ownership, and the manufacturing company that I deal with is the one who supplies any additional orders. My question is: is my way of doing business acceptable according to Islam?","['Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with doing business in this way, as it is a contract to supply a manufactured product, so it comes under the rulings on istisna‘ (contract to have something made or done), and it is permissible for the customer to pay the price in full at the time of making the contract, or to pay in instalments.\nThe International Islamic Fiqh Council belonging to the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, during its twelfth session in Riyadh, in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, 25 Jumada al-Akhirah – 1 Rajab 1421 AH/23-28 September 2000 CE, issued a statement regarding supply contracts, in which they said:\n…\xa0 Secondly: if the product mentioned in the supply contract needs to be manufactured, then the contract is istisna‘ (contract to have something made or done) and subject to the relevant rulings. A statement no. 65 (3/7) has been issued regarding istisna‘.\nThirdly: if the product mentioned in the supply contract does not need to be manufactured, and its qualities and specifications are known, then it must be delivered at the agreed time. This may be done in one of two ways:\n1.. The customer requesting the product pays in full at the time of drawing up the contract. In that case, it is a contract that comes under the rulings on salam transaction (payment in advance), in which case it is permissible, subject to the conditions stipulated in Islamic teachings, which are explained in the Council’s statement no. 85 (2/9).\n2.. The customer requesting the product does not pay in full at the time of drawing up the contract. In that case, it is not permissible, because it is based on a mutual promise between both parties, and the council’s statements nos. 40 and 41 state that a mutual promise looks like a business contract but it is invalid, because it is like selling a debt for a debt.\nBut if the promise is not binding on one or both parties, then it is permissible, provided that the sale is done with a new contract or by delivery. End quote.\nPlease see the answers to questions no. 192623 and 179228 for two other ways that are Islamically acceptable, namely: acting as a proxy in return for a fee, or a profit sharing (mudarabah) contract with a promise to buy.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/246650/he-shows-a-sample-of-the-product-and-supplies-it-to-the-one-who-orders-it-after-having-it-made
72915,"Is it permissible to draw a face of a human without features? If it is permissible, can I draw a human’s face from all sides, without features, as in some programs?","['Praise be to Allah.The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stated that whose who make images – by drawing or engraving – will be punished on the Day of Resurrection, and these prohibited images are images of animate beings , such as humans, animals and birds, based on the fact that in the Hadith it says that they will be told: “Bring to life that which you have created.”\xa0\nIt was narrated from `Abdullah ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Those who make images will be punished on the Day of Resurrection, and it will be said to them: `Bring to life that which you have created.’” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 5607 and Muslim, 2108)\xa0\nIt seems that images which do not have complete features , which do not have a nose or eyes, are not included under the heading of prohibited images, and the ones who make them are not included in this warning, because they cannot truly be said to be images, and these images do not imply imitating the creation of Allah.\xa0\nIt was narrated that `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The people who will be most severely punished on the Day of Resurrection will be those who imitate the creation of Allah.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 5610 and Muslim, 2107)\xa0\nShaykh Muhammad ibn Salih Al-`Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“With regard to dolls made of cloth , where the image does not have clear features, even though it has limbs, a head and neck, but there are no eyes or nose, there is nothing wrong with that, because this is not imitating the creation of Allah.” (Majmu` Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin, 2/question no. 330)\xa0\nThe Shaykh (may Allah have mercy on him) also said:\xa0\n“Everyone who makes something that imitates the creation of Allah is included in this Hadith, which says that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed the image makers… and his words “The people who will be most severely punished on the Day of Resurrection will be the image-makers.” But as I said, if the image is not clear and if it does not have eyes or a nose or mouth or fingers, then it is not a complete image, and is not imitating the creation of Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted.”\xa0\nFor more details, please refet to the following answers: 365 , 20325 , and 7222 .\xa0\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/72915/is-drawing-faces-prohibited
166106,How can I differentiate between maniy (semen) and madhiy (prostatic fluid)? Is it by smell?,"['Praise be to Allah.There are three basic differences between semen and prostatic fluid. They are:\n1.. Semen is emitted forcefully, whereas prostatic fluid is not emitted forcefully, and the individual may not feel that it is emitted.\n2.. Semen is a white, thick fluid, which smells like palm tree pollen or dough, whereas prostatic fluid is a thin, clear, sticky fluid that has no smell.\n3.. Emission of semen is followed by loss of desire, whereas the emission of prostatic fluid is not followed by loss of desire.\nAn-Nawawi said in al-Majmu‘ (2/141):\nEach of these three is sufficient on its own to determine that it is semen, and it is not stipulated that all three characteristics be present. If none of these characteristics is present, then it is not semen. End quote.\nIt says in Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah (4/138):\nManiy (semen) is a thick white liquid that is emitted from the penis with feelings of pleasure. After it is emitted, the individual feels tired. Semen is pure (tahir) according to the correct scholarly view, but it is recommended (mustahabb) to clean it off one’s garment by washing or scratching it. Emitting semen makes ghusl obligatory, whether it happens as a result of intercourse or a wet dream. If it is emitted without feelings of pleasure, because of sickness or intense cold, then it does not make ghusl obligatory; rather it becomes obligatory to do wudu only.\nMadhiy (prostatic fluid) is thin, white and sticky. It is emitted from the penis during foreplay with one’s wife, or when thinking about sex, but it is not emitted forcefully and does not lead to tiredness. Prostatic fluid is impure (najis), and if it is emitted the individual must do wudu, wash the penis and testicles, and sprinkle water over where it got onto his body and clothes.\nWadiy is a thin, white fluid that may be emitted from the penis after urinating. It is impure (najis) and makes it obligatory to do wudu.

82907,My wife recently became pregnant for the second time and we want to announce it to everyone. Is it permissible to announce it right away or is there a waiting period of three months before announcing pregnancy? Could you please tell me what the ruling is on that.,"['Praise be to Allah.We ask Allah to bless you with righteous offspring and to bless this child.\xa0\nThere is nothing wrong with telling other people about the pregnancy after you find out about it, and it is not essential to wait until three months have passed. Rather it is permissible to tell others before then, but you should limit that to family and close friends only. This is a general principle which should be paid attention to when telling others of blessings. The news should be given only to those who wish good for you and will rejoice over it, so as to ward off the evil eye and destructive envy.\xa0\nThe evidence for that is the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Be discreet in order to achieve what you want, for everyone who is blessed is envied.” (Narrated by At-Tabarani and Abu Nu`aym; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Al-Jami`, no. 943)\xa0\nFor more details, please refer to the following answers: 82465 , 119767 , 12368 , 7889 , 12287 , and 88734 . \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/82907/when-to-announce-pregnancy-in-islam
