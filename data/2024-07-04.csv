464257,"I work via the Internet, and I keep my profits in dollars in my Pioneer online banking account. This online bank allows me to transfer cash in dollars from it to other, real bank accounts. My question is: is it permissible for me to sell dollars to my brother by transferring them from my online banking account to his account in a real bank, then he gives me the value in local currency? The problem that makes me ask whether this transaction is permissible is the fact that the amount that I am going to transfer to him will not enter his account immediately; it may take two days or even as long as ten days. Is it permissible if I wait and do not collect the equivalent of the dollars in local currency until the day when the money reaches my brother’s account? Or is it permissible for us to work out the value of the dollars at the exchange rate on the day on which I transferred the money from my account in the online bank to my brother’s account in the real bank, by sending him a copy of the transfer to prove that the transfer had been done? Please note that this is a matter of mutual consent between us, and I am not really bothered by fluctuations in the exchange rate. Rather my concern is whether this transaction is permissible or not according to Islam, and whether there is anything in it that is contrary to Islamic teachings.","['Praise be to Allah.Your selling the dollars in your account to your brother in return for local currency is called an exchange, and the condition of it being permissible is that the exchange should take place immediately.\nThe exchange can be either real, meaning that the money is exchanged hand-to-hand, or it may be virtual, meaning that the money goes into the account of each of you.\nThe basis for stipulating that the exchange take place immediately is the report narrated by Muslim (1587) from ‘Ubadah ibn as-Samit (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “: “Gold for gold, silver for silver, wheat for wheat, barley for barley, dates for dates, salt for salt, like for like, same for same, hand to hand. But if these commodities differ, then sell as you like, as long as it is hand to hand [that is, exchanged immediately].”\nPaper currencies come under the same rulings as gold and silver.\nIt said in a statement of the Islamic Fiqh Council belonging to the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC):\nWith regard to the rulings on paper currencies, they are legal tender by which prices are measured, and they come under the established Islamic rulings on gold and silver with regard to matters such as riba (usury), zakah, payment in advance (salam transaction) and so on.\nEnd quote from Majallat al-Majma‘ (issue no. 3, vol. 3, p. 1650; issue no. 5, vol. 3, p. 1609).\nBased on that, it is not permissible for you to take local currency from your brother when there is a delay in the dollars being deposited in his account.\nBut it is permissible for you to send the dollars to him to keep as a trust for you, then once the dollars have been deposited in his account, it is permissible to do this exchange, whereby he will take possession of the dollars and you will take local currency from him at the rate of exchange on that day.\nIt says in Kashshaf al-Qina‘ (3/269): If he gives him five dirhams for half a dinar, then he gives him a dinar for him to take half of it, the exchange is valid because it takes place immediately, even if he does not give him back half a dinar before they part.\nSo the half dinar is his, and the other half is like a trust in the hand of the recipient, because of what was noted above.\nAnd they may separate before he gives him back the other half of the dinar.\nThen if he wants to exchange the other half for what is left of the dinar with him, that is permissible.\nOr if he buys something from him with the remaining half dinar, that is permissible.\nOr if he wants to make the remaining half-dinar payment in advance for something, that is permissible, because it is his money and is not a loan that he gave to the other man.\nOr if he wants to give it as a gift to the other man, so he lets him keep the remaining half dinar, that is permissible, because he is the owner of the wealth and is disposing of it in an appropriate manner. End quote.\nThis indicates that it is permissible to leave wealth with someone else as a trust, then exchange it for a different currency.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/464257/is-it-permissible-to-transfer-dollars-to-the-account-of-someone-else-then-receive-from-him-the-equivalent-in-local-currency-even-though-the-transfer-takes-time-to-reach-his-account
409746,What will happen to the Dajjal? Will he go to hell?,"['Praise be to Allah.The false messiah the Dajjal is a human who will appear at the end of time. He is one of the major signs of the Hour. In the beginning, he will say that he is a prophet, then he will say that he is divine – exalted be Allah far above that.\nHe will call the people to believe in him, then it will become clear that he is not only a disbeliever; rather he is one of the worst of the disbelievers among the people of this earth, and there will be no doubt about that. Hence the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) told us that between his eyes will be written the word “kafir (disbeliever).” The false messiah the Dajjal will persist in his disbelief until the true Messiah, ‘Isa ibn Maryam (peace be upon him), kills him.\nThere follow some of the hadiths which were narrated about him:\nIbn Maajah (4215) narrated that Abu Umamah al-Bahili said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) addressed us, and most of his speech was talking about the Dajjaal and warning us against him. Among other things, he said: “There has never been any tribulation on earth since Allah created the progeny of Adam that will be greater than the tribulation of the Dajjal. Allah never sent any Prophet but he warned his nation about the Dajjal. I am the last of the prophets and you are the last of the nations, and he will inevitably emerge among you.\nIf he appears whilst I am among you, I will contend with him on your behalf, and if he appears when I am not among you, then each man must fend for himself and Allah will take care of every Muslim on my behalf. He will emerge from Khallah, between Syria and ‘Iraq, and will wreak havoc right and left. O slaves of Allah, remain steadfast.\nI will describe him to you in a manner in which none of the Prophets has described him before me. He will start by saying ‘I am a Prophet,’ but there is no Prophet after me. Then he will say, ‘I am your Lord.’ But you will not see your Lord until you die. He is one-eyed, but your Lord is not one-eyed, and written between his eyes is ‘kafir (disbeliever)’. Every believer will read it, whether he is literate or illiterate.\nPart of his fitnah will be that he will have with him a paradise and a hell, but his hell will be a paradise and his paradise a hell. Whoever is tested with his fire (hell), let him seek the help of Allah and recite the first verses of al-Kahf, then it will be cool and safe for him, as the fire was for Ibrahim.\nPart of his fitnah will be that he will say to a Bedouin, ‘What do you think, if I resurrect your father and mother for you, will you bear witness that I am your Lord?’ He will say, ‘Yes.’ Then two devils will appear to him in the form of his father and mother and will say, ‘O my son, follow him, for he is your Lord.’\nAnd part of his fitnah will be that he will overpower a single soul and kill him, then he will cut him with a saw until he falls in two pieces. Then he will say: ‘Look at this slave of mine; I will resurrect him now, then he will claim that he has a Lord other than me.’ Then Allah will resurrect him and the evil one will say to him: ‘Who is your Lord?’ and he will say, ‘Allah is my Lord, and you are the enemy of Allah, you are the Dajjaal. By Allah, I have never been more certain about you than I am today.’…”\nClassed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Jaami‘ (13833). See also: Qissat al-Masih ad-Dajjal by Shaykh al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him).\nMuslim (7560) narrated from an-Nawwas ibn Sam‘an that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) mentioned the Dajjal and he mentioned the son of Maryam, then he said: “He will pursue him until he catches up with him at the date of Ludd, then he will kill him.”\nAn-Nawawi said:\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) mentioned the gate of Ludd. Ludd (Lod) is a town close to Bayt al-Maqdis (Jerusalem). End quote.\nAhmad (3868) narrated from ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Those who will be most severely punished on the Day of Resurrection are: a man who was killed by a Prophet or who killed a Prophet, a leader who led people in the way of misguidance, and a maker of images.”\nShaykh Ahmad Shakir said: Its isnad is sahih.\nAl-Bukhari (4076) narrated with a mawquf isnad that Ibn ‘Abbaas said: “Allah’s wrath is severe against one who is killed by a prophet.”\nOnce this is established, we know that the false messiah the Dajjal will die as a disbeliever, persisting in his disbelief. He will be killed by the true Messiah ‘Isa ibn Maryam (peace be upon him) and he will be in the fire of hell, one of the most severely punished of people therein.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/409746/what-will-be-the-fate-of-the-false-messiah-the-dajjal-in-the-hereafter
