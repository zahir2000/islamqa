466518,"I had a question I think a lot of sisters might be wondering about, and I would like to help other sisters with the answer Aof these questions in shaa Allah. So I recently stopped using makeup as I learned that tabarrujj is a very big sin. However I wanted to ask if using eyebrow gel (that has no color, and is only used to keep eyebrows from being messy and stay in shape) is allowed to use? As well as curling ones eyelashes, as one is not applying any makeup on the eyelashes but only curling them to make them more visible? Also what’s the opinion regarding using lip oils and lip balms to keep lips from being chapped? They give no color but have some gloss, is these still considered tabarrujj? Lastly, as perfume is also tabarrujj, what can someone use as an alternative to perfume to feel more clean and feminine etc, is scented oils permissible?","['Praise be to Allah.Your question contains a number of issues:\n-1-\nEyebrow gel, which is a clear, sticky substance, is used to adjust the eyebrows and keep them in good shape. In other words, it is a kind of combing the eyebrows to make them look better.\nThe basic principle with regard to using this substance is that it is permissible, and it is regarded as a type of adornment. So for a woman who chooses to follow the juristic view that the face is not ‘awrah and may be uncovered – because the issue of a woman uncovering her face is a controversial matter, and on our website we think that it is more likely that it is obligatory to cover the face, as discussed in the answer to question no. 219722 – it is not permissible for her to apply this gel when going out, but it is permissible for her to use it in the presence of those in front of whom it is permissible for her to show her adornment.\nThe other issue here is that if this substance forms a layer over the eyebrows that prevents water from reaching them, then when doing wudu, the woman must make sure to remove it so that the water will wet her eyebrows.\nIf the condition of using this substance is that it should not be touched by water for one day, or for a longer or shorter period during which the times for prayer will come, then it is not permissible to use it in that case, if it means that the face will not be washed or that the eyes will not be washed when doing wudu because of that. Rather she may use it during her monthly period when she does not need to do wudu.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If there is some wax, dough, henna or the like on some part of the body which prevents water from reaching some spots on that limb, then the individual’s wudu is not valid, whether there is a lot of that substance or a little.\nBut if some trace or colour of henna is left on the hand, without the substance itself, or there is some trace of fluid oil, in such a way that the water can reach the skin and run over it but not remain, then his wudu is valid.""(Al-Majmu‘\xa0 1/467).\nIn al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah, it says: The Hanafis and Malikis stated that one of the conditions of wudu being valid is removing anything that prevents the water from reaching the skin because it forms a barrier, such as wax, fat, dough and mud. The Shafa‘is and Hanbalis regarded removing anything that prevents water from reaching the skin as one of the conditions of wudu.""(Al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah al-Kuwaitiyyah\xa0 43/329).\n-2-\nCurling eyelashes, which is done without adding any substance to them. This is also a kind of adornment. The basic principle is that it is permissible to do it, but for a woman who chooses to follow the juristic view that the face is not ‘awrah and may be uncovered, it is not permissible for her to do this when going out, but it is permissible for her to do it in the presence of those in front of whom it is permissible for her to show her adornment.\n-3-\nLip oils and lip balms are of many types, and most of them do not form a layer on the lips. Based on that, with regard to the ruling on wudu, they do not affect its validity.\nBut if they are the type that forms a layer on the lip and has substance, then this should be removed when doing wudu so that water will reach the skin.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If the fat does not have substance – rather a trace of it remains on the part of the body to be washed when doing wudu – then it does not matter, but in that case you should make sure to rub the limb whilst pouring water over it, because usually the fat does not dissolve in water, and perhaps water may not reach the entire limb.""(Majmu‘ Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymin\xa0 11/147).\nHowever, with regard to these things being adornment, they are of different types. If the lip balm is shiny in a manner that attracts attention like a cosmetic, then it is a type of adornment, and the basic principle is that wearing it is permissible. So for a woman who chooses to follow the juristic view that the face is not ‘awrah and may be uncovered, it is not permissible for her to apply lip balm when going out, but it is permissible for her to use it in the presence of those in front of whom it is permissible for her to show her adornment.\n-4-\nPerfumed oils and alternatives to perfume.\nThe basic principle is that in the case of perfume of which the smell is detectable by others, it is not permissible for a woman to use it when going out of the house and passing by non-mahrams. There is a stern warning concerning that. It was narrated that Abu Musa al-Ash‘ari said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Any woman who puts on perfume then passes by people so that they may smell her fragrance, is a zaniyah.” Narrated by an-Nasa’i (5126); classed as hasan by al-Albani.\nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Any woman who perfumes herself with bakhur (incense) should not attend ‘Isha’ prayer with us.” Narrated by Muslim (444).\nWith regard to perfumed oils and alternatives to perfume, there are different types available in the marketplace. The guideline on the ruling concerning them is:\nIf their fragrance is detectable by others when going out, then the ruling is as mentioned above; that is not allowed and is prohibited. But if their fragrance is not obvious to others, and they are only worn to make the body smell good and remove any bad odours from it, then there is nothing wrong with using this type when going out.\nIt was narrated from ‘Imran ibn Husayn that the Prophet of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “I do not ride on red saddle cloths and I do not wear clothes dyed with safflower or a shirt hemmed with silk.” He said: Al-Hasan pointed to the neck of his shirt. He said: And he said: “Perfume for men should have a scent and no colour, and perfume for women should have a colour and no scent.”\nNarrated by Abu Dawud (4048), at-Tirmidhi (2788) and others; classed as sahih by al-Albani.\nSa‘id ibn Abi ‘Arubah – the narrator of the hadith – said, after narrating it, as is recorded by Abu Dawud:\nI think he said: They understood his words concerning women’s perfume as applying if she goes out; if she is with her husband then she may wear whatever perfume she wants.\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The woman is enjoined to cover herself when she goes out of her house, and if perfume that has a strong fragrance were permitted, that would attract attention and cause more temptation.""(Fath al-Bari by Ibn Hajar 10/366).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/466518/what-is-the-ruling-on-eyebrow-gel-curling-eyelashes-lip-moisturiser-and-alternatives-for-perfumes
96589,How many hours is it permissible for a person to sleep?,"['Praise be to Allah.Sleep is one of the signs of Allah\xa0\nSleep is one of the signs of Allah in this universe, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And among His Signs is your sleep by night and by day, and your seeking of His Bounty. Verily, in that are indeed signs for a people who listen.”\xa0[Ar-Rum 30:23]\nIn principle, sleeping is to be at night, but sleeping during the day is also possible. Allah has created the day for work and going out seeking provision, and He has created the night for rest; so sleep takes place at night and work during the day. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And it is He Who makes the night a covering for you, and the sleep (as) a repose, and makes the day Nushur (i.e. getting up and going about here and there for daily work, after one’s sleep at night or like resurrection after one’s death)”\xa0[Al-Furqan 25:47]\xa0\n“See they not that We have made the night for them to rest therein, and the day sight-giving? Verily, in this are Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) for the people who believe”\xa0[An-Naml 27:86]\xa0\n“And We have made your sleep as a thing for rest. And We have made the night as a covering (through its darkness), And We have made the day for livelihood.”\xa0[An-Naba’ 78:9-11]\nImam Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“I.e., among the signs is that which has been created for you of sleep by night and by day, in which you get rest and stillness, and exhaustion and tiredness are taken away; and wakefulness and striving for one’s livelihood have been ordained during the day."" (Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 6/310)\xa0\nShaykh Muhammad ibn Salih Al-`Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \xa0\n“And We have made your sleep as a thing for rest” means: to put an end to tiredness, because sleep puts an end to that which comes before it of tiredness, and a person renews his energy thereby for what lies ahead. Hence you see that if a man becomes tired and sleeps, he is refreshed and his energy is renewed. This is a blessing and it is also one of the signs of Allah, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And among His Signs is your sleep by night and by day, and your seeking of His Bounty”\xa0[Ar-Rum 30:23]\n“And We have made the day for livelihood” i.e., living whereby people seek their provision according to their status and circumstances. This is the blessing of Allah upon His slaves."" (Tafsir Juz’ `Amma, p. 22, 23).\nHow many hours should we sleep according to Islam?\nThere is nothing in Shari`ah to suggest that a Muslim has to sleep at a certain time and wake up at a certain time, and Islam does not tell the Muslim to sleep a certain number of hours. That depends on people’s ages and natures, and how much rest their bodies need, and it also depends on the nature of their work. One who works at night will sleep more during the day and one who works during the day will sleep more at night. Sleep during the winter is different from sleep during the summer and so on.\xa0\nThe natural average length of sleep is between 5 and 8 hours every day. If someone sleeps less than that because he is able to put up with that, or someone sleeps more than that because his body needs that, there is nothing wrong with that. What matters is that Islam obliges the Muslim to observe the times of prayer, at which time he should be awake so that he can perform the act of worship in the proper manner and with energy. If his body needs rest and sleep, he should not resist that.\xa0\nShaykh Muhammad ibn Ahmad As-Safarini (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“It is not right to resist sleep a great deal and stay up late often. Resisting and avoiding sleep will lead to other problems such as bad moods, muddled thinking, and exhaustion that prevents one from understanding and working properly, and it can lead to many fatal illnesses. \xa0\nCreation is based on balance and whoever adheres to moderation has achieved all goodness. In Al-Adab Al-Kubra, one of the wise men said: Drowsiness takes away reason, but sleep increases it.\xa0\nSleep is one of the blessings that Allah bestows upon His slaves, hence He reminds them of it in His Book.” (Ghidha’ Al-Albab fi Sharh Manzumat Al-Adab, 2/359)\xa0\nIt should be noted that sleeping more than the body needs will make one lazy in worship and will make one slow in thinking. Hence there are some sayings of the Salaf which criticise sleeping too much.\xa0\nAl-Fudayl ibn `Iyad (may Allah have mercy on him) said: There are two qualities that harden the heart: sleeping too much and eating too much.\xa0\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“As for the five things that corrupt the heart, they are those that are referred to: mixing too much with people, wishful thinking, being attached to anything other than Allah, eating one’s fill, and sleeping. These five are the greatest corrupters of the heart."" (Madarij As-Salikin\xa0, 1/453).\nHe explained that which has to do with sleep and said:\xa0\n“The fifth corrupter is: sleeping too much, for it deadens the heart, makes the body heavy, wastes time, and generates a great deal of carelessness and laziness. Some of it is very disliked and some is harmful and brings no benefit to the body.\xa0\nThe most beneficial of sleep is that which comes when the need for it is greatest. Sleeping at the beginning of the night is better than at the end, and sleeping in the middle of the day is better than sleeping at the beginning or end of the day. The closer sleep is to either the beginning or end of the day, the less beneficial it is and the more harmful, especially sleeping at `Asr time, and sleeping at the beginning of the day, except in the case of one who has stayed up late. Among disliked kinds of sleep in their view is sleeping between Fajr prayer and sunrise, because that is a precious time. This time is of great benefit for those who are devoted to Allah; even if they had been worshipping all night, they would not allow themselves to stop at that time until the sun has risen, because it is the beginning of the day, when provision comes down and is divided, and blessings are bestowed. That is the beginning of the day and the whole day depends on what happens during that time, no one should sleep at that time unless he is compelled to.\xa0\nTo sum up, the best and most beneficial of sleep is sleep during the first half of the night, and the last sixth, which is equivalent to eight hours. This is the best sleep according to doctors. Anything more or less than that will have a proportionately detrimental effect on the body, in their view.\xa0\nAnother kind of sleep that is of no benefit is sleeping straight after sunset, until the twilight has disappeared. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) disliked that, therefore it is disliked according to Shari`ah and is naturally disliked. Just as sleeping too much leads to these problems, resisting and avoiding sleep will lead to other problems such as bad moods, muddled thinking, and exhaustion that prevents one from understanding and working properly, and it can lead to many fatal illnesses, whereby a person will not be able to think properly and will feel physically weak. Creation is based on balance and whoever adheres to moderation has achieved all goodness. \xa0\xa0And Allah is the One Whose help we seek.” (Madarij As-Salikin, 1/459, 460)\nFor more details, please refer to the following answers: 160880 , 75612 , 21388 , 36889 , 21216 , 14033 , 335223 , and 827 .\nAnd Allah is the Source of strength.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/96589/how-many-hours-should-we-sleep-according-to-islam
325575,"What is the ruling on resting on the knees in the prayer, when sitting for the tashahhud and between the two prostrations, for one who cannot bend his knees or finds it difficult to do so?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nKneeling or resting on the knees is one specific way of sitting, because the one who does that is in a state of alertness and in a hurry. Mostly that happens when one is arguing, or in a state of fear and suspense, and the like.\nAz-Zajjaj (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhat is meant by kneeling or being on one’s knees is resting on one’s knees and toes. Ma‘ani al-Quran wa I‘rabuhu by az-Zajjaaj (4/435).\nImam Ibn Sidah, in al-Mu‘jam al-‘Azim, wrote a section explaining different ways of sitting, in which he said: Kneeling means sitting resting on one’s knees when arguing and the like. End quote from al-Mukhassas (3/333); Lisan al-‘Arab (14/131).\nAsh-Shurayshi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Kneeling means sitting resting on the knees. Sharh Maqamat al-Hariri (2/371).\nTo sum up:\nKneeling is a specific way of sitting, but it is not usually resorted to in a calm situation; rather it is something that is rarely resorted to, or is resorted to when needed.\nSecondly:\nThe Sunnah way of sitting between the two prostrations is iftirash (sitting muftarishan, which means sitting with the right foot held upright on the toes, whilst sitting on the left foot), and this is also done in the tashahhud of a two-rak‘ah prayer; and tawarruk (sitting mutawarrikan, which means slipping the left foot under the right calf, with one’s buttocks on the ground) in the final tashahhud of a three- or four-rak‘ah prayer, as has been explained in the answer to question no. 13340 .\nBut if the worshipper cannot sit muftarishan, or that is extraordinarily difficult for him, for any reason, then he may sit in whatever way is easy for him, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {So fear Allah as much as you are able } [at-Taghabun 64:16], and because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If I instruct you to do something, then do as much of it as you are able.” Al-Bukhari (7288).\nAnd he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to ‘Imran ibn Husayn: “Pray standing; and if you cannot, then sitting; and if you cannot, then lying on your side.” Al-Bukhari (1066).\nThus he explained to him that standing, which is an essential and obligatory part of the prayer, is waived when one is unable to do it, so how about the manner of sitting, which is Sunnah (not obligatory)?\nSo if a person’s prayer is valid if he does not sit in the Sunnah manner without an excuse, then it is more appropriate that his prayer should still be valid when there is an excuse, as the reward for his intention that he would sit in the Sunnah manner if he were able to will be recorded for him.\nAbu Hamid al-Ghazali (may Allah have mercy on him) said: There is no specific way to sit, besides which nothing else could be valid; rather it is valid to sit in whatever way one can.\nEnd quote from Fath al-‘Aziz bi Sharh al-Wajiz (3/494).\nAl-Ansari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Whatever way a person sits in the prayer, it is valid. End quote from Asna al-Matalib (1/164).\nAl-Juwayni (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If he rests on his feet and knees, I do not think that there is anything wrong with it. End quote from Nihayat al-Matlab fi Dirayah al-Madhhab (2/215).\nShaykh Mar‘i al-Maqdisi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Sitting between the two prostrations in any manner is valid, but the Sunnah is to sit muftarishan, resting on the left foot and holding the right foot upright.\nEnd quote from Dalil at-Talib li Nayl al-Matalib (p. 34).\nBased on that, if someone is not able to sit in the Sunnah manner between the two prostrations or in the tashahhud, it is permissible for him to sit resting on his knees.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/325575/is-it-permissible-to-rest-on-the-knees-and-toes-when-sitting-for-the-tashahhud-and-between-the-two-prostrations
65924,What is the ruling on an imam who reads from the Mus-haf when leading prayers in congregation?,"['Praise be to Allah.Reading from the Mus-haf in Sunnah prayers\nThere is nothing wrong with reading Quran from the Mus-haf during an optional prayer, such as Qiyam Al-layl .\xa0\nBut in the case of obligatory prayers, it is disliked to do that, because in most cases there is no need for it. But if there is a need, then there is nothing wrong with reading from the Mus-haf in that case.\xa0\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Mughni, 1/335:\xa0\n“Ahmad said: There is nothing wrong with leading the people in Qiyam prayer whilst reading from the Mus-haf. It was said to him: What about obligatory prayers? He said: I have not heard anything concerning that. Al-Qadi said: It is disliked in obligatory prayers, but there is nothing wrong with it in voluntary prayers if one has not memorized (Quran), but if one has memorized Quran then it is also disliked. He said: Ahmad was asked about leading the prayers whilst reading from the Mus-haf in Ramadan. He said: If that is necessary (it may be done)… and it was narrated from Ibn Hamid that it is equally permissible in both optional and obligatory prayers.\xa0\nThe evidence for it being permissible is the report narrated by Abu Bakr Al-Athram and Ibn Abu Dawud (may Allah have mercy on them) from `A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), according to which she would be led in prayer by a slave of hers who read from the Mus-haf .\xa0\nAz-Zuhri was asked about a man who read from the Mus-haf in Ramadan. He said: The best ones among us used to read from the Mus-hafs …\xa0\nReading from the Mus-haf has been permitted because of the need to listen to the Quran and recite it in night prayers (Qiyam).\xa0\nThe ruling on it being disliked applies only to those who have memorized the Quran, because they will be needlessly distracted from proper submissiveness in prayer (Khushu`) by that, and from looking at the place of prostration. And it is disliked in obligatory prayers in general, because usually there is no need for it.”\xa0\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Majmu` (4/27):\xa0\n“If a person reads Quran from the Mus-haf, this does not invalidate his prayer, whether he has memorized the Quran or not; in fact that is obligatory if he has not memorized Al-Fatihah.\xa0\nDoes reading from the Mus-haf invalidate the prayer?\nWhat we have mentioned, that reading from the Mus-haf does not invalidate the prayer, is our view and the view of Malik, Abu Yusuf, Muhammad and Ahmad.\xa0\nReading from the Mus-haf in obligatory prayer\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Is it permissible for the imam to read from the Mus-haf during the five daily prayers, especially Fajr when lengthy reading is required and there is the fear of making mistakes or forgetting?\xa0\nHe replied:\xa0\n“That is permissible if there is a need for it, just as it is permissible to read from the Mus-haf in Tarawih for one who has not memorized the Quran. Dhakwan, the freed slave of `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) used to lead her in prayer in Ramadan, reading from the Mus-haf, as was narrated by Al-Bukhari in his Sahih in a Mu’allaq Majzum report. It is Sunnah to recite at length in Fajr prayer, so if the imam has not memorized Al-Mufassal or anything else from the rest of the Quran, it is permissible for him to recite from the Mus-haf. But it is prescribed for him to strive to memorize the Quran, or at least to memorize Al-Mufassal, so that he will not need to read from the Mus-haf. Al-Mufassal refers to the portion of the Quran that starts with Surat Qaf, up to the end of the Quran. Whoever strives to memorize, Allah will make it easy for him, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And whosoever fears Allah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty)” [Al-Talaq 65:2]\xa0\n“And We have indeed made the Quran easy to understand and remember; then is there any one who will remember (or receive admonition)?”\xa0[Al-Qamar 54:17]\nAnd Allah is the Source of strength.” (Majmu` Fatawa Ibn Baz, 11/117)\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/65924/can-i-read-from-the-mus-haf-while-praying
