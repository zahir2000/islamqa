21869,"I am a woman, I live in one city and I travel with my husband to another city for some purpose or to walk about and go shopping. Sometimes, the time for Maghrib or ‘Isha comes and we go and look for a mosque that has room for women to pray, but we cannot find such a place. So my husband prays but I cannot find a place to pray.","['Praise be to Allah.Is it permissible to pray in the car?\nWhat you did is not correct, because standing when one is able to do so is an essential part of the prayer. You could pray in the mosque, in the men’s room, after the men have left. If you cannot find a mosque then you can pray on the ground in any place.\xa0\nPraying in cars , planes, trains or other means of conveyance, where one cannot face the qiblah or pray standing, is not permissible in the case of obligatory prayers unless two conditions are met:\xa0\n\nThere should be the fear that the time for the obligatory prayer will end before reaching your destination. But if you will reach your destination before the time for prayer is over, you should wait until you get there to pray.\xa0\nIt should not be possible to get off and pray on the ground. If it is possible to do so then you must do that.\xa0\n\nIf these two conditions are met, then it is permissible to pray in the vehicle . The evidence for it being permissible to pray in this case is the general meaning of the verses in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope.” [Al-Baqarah 2:286]\xa0\n“So keep your duty to Allah and fear Him as much as you can.” [Al-Taghabun 64:16]\xa0\n“and [Allah] has not laid upon you in religion any hardship.” [Al-Hajj 22:78]\nCan you pray sitting in the car?\nIf it is said, if I am allowed to pray in these vehicles, should I face the qiblah and should I pray sitting even though I am able to stand?\xa0\nThe answer is:\xa0\nIf you are able to face the qiblah throughout the prayer, then you must do that, because it is a condition of an obligatory prayer being valid whether one is travelling or not.\xa0\nIf it is not possible to face the qiblah throughout the prayer , then fear Allah as much as you can and do your best, because of the evidence narrated above.\xa0\nThis has to do with obligatory prayers. With regard to supererogatory (nafl) prayers, the matter is more relaxed; it is permissible for the Muslim to pray in the vehicles mentioned no matter what direction they are facing, even if he could get down on the ground at some times, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to pray nafl prayers on his mount no matter what direction it was facing.\xa0\nJabir narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) “used to pray voluntary prayers when he was riding without facing the qiblah .” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1094).\xa0\nBut it is better to face the qiblah when starting to pray a nafl prayer, if that is possible when travelling.\xa0(See Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 8/124)\xa0\nIs offering obligatory prayers sitting down allowed?\nWith regard to offering obligatory prayers sitting down when one is able to stand, that is not permissible because of the general meaning of the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And stand before Allah with obedience.” [Al-Baqarah 2:238]\n\xa0‘Imran ibn Husayn narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to him: “Pray standing; if you cannot, then sitting ; and if you cannot then lying on your side.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1117)\xa0\nAnd Allah is the Source of strength.\xa0(Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 8/126)\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21869/can-you-pray-in-the-car
13406,My relative is suffering from a sickness that keeps him confined to bed. Is it permissible for him to pray at home?,"['Praise be to Allah.Patience in the face of calamities\nWe ask Allah to bless the sick Muslims with reward and healing. Undoubtedly the one who suffers sickness and bears it with patience, Allah will expiate his sins thereby and raise him in status. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is nothing that befalls a believer, not even a thorn that pricks him, but Allah will record for him thereby one hasanah (good deed) or will remove from him one sin.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2572)\xa0\nCan you pray at home if you are sick?\nThe sick person is excused from Jumu`ah prayer and from praying in congregation . What is meant by that is the kind of sickness which means that it is too difficult for the person to go and pray in the mosque. This is based on the following evidence:\xa0\n\nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0“So keep your duty to Allah and fear Him as much as you can.” [Al-Taghabun 64:16]\nAnd He says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0 “Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope.” [Al-Baqarah 2:286]\nAnd He says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0“No blame or sin is there upon the blind, nor is there blame or sin upon the lame, nor is there blame or sin upon the sick.” [Al-Fath 48:17]\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If I command you to do a thing then do as much of it as you can.” (Agreed upon)\xa0\nAnd when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) fell sick, he did not attend prayers in congregation, even though his house was beside the mosque.\xa0\nIbn Mas’ud said: “There was a time when no one stayed away from the prayer except a hypocrite who was known for his hypocrisy or one who was sick…” (Narrated by Muslim, 654)\xa0\n\nAll of this evidence indicates that the sick person is spared the obligation to pray Jumu`ah and prayers in congregation .\xa0(See al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 4/438)\xa0\nShaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“It is obligatory for Muslim men to pray in the mosque and increase the numbers of the Muslims, and to go out to the mosques (to pray), otherwise they will be resembling the hypocrites. Ibn Mas’ud said: “There was a time when no one stayed away from the prayer except a hypocrite who was known for his hypocrisy.”\xa0\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) thought of burning down the houses of those who stayed away from the prayer.\xa0\nSo you and every Muslim who is able to must pray in the mosque; the Muslim is not allowed to pray at home unless he has a valid shar’i excuse such as sickness or fear . May Allah help us all to follow His guidance.” (Majmu’ Fatawa, vol. 12)\nFor more, please see these answers: 151992 , 147381 , and 89774\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13406/can-you-pray-at-home-if-you-are-sick
