418542,"I underwent a procedure to retrieve eggs, but the doctor confirmed that the eggs had failed after retrieval, may my Lord compensate us. But I bled after the procedure; does this mean that I have to do ghusl, like ghusl for janabah?","['Praise be to Allah.The bleeding that makes ghusl obligatory for a woman is menstrual bleeding and postpartum bleeding (nifas) only.\nIn your case, it seems that the bleeding only resulted from the needle used for retrieving the eggs, because retrieval of the eggs from the woman’s ovaries is done by inserting a needle into the ovary, as has been discussed previously in the answer to question no. 234124 .\nWhat appears to be the case makes us think it most likely that this bleeding is not menses.\nThe rulings are to be based on what is most likely to be the case, when we cannot be certain.\nAl-Qarafi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIn principle according to Islamic teachings, nothing is to be taken into account except what we know for certain, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {And do not pursue that of which you have no knowledge} [al-Isra’ 17:36]. That is because there is no room for error in that case, but in most cases it is difficult to have certain knowledge. Therefore Islam permitted following what is most likely to be the case, because it rarely turns out to be wrong, and most of the time it turns out to be correct. When there is doubt, the matter should be regarded as remaining as it originally was. So whenever there is doubt, the thing is not to be taken into consideration, and we should refer to what was originally the case before we had doubts about what it is now …""(Adh-Dhakhirah\xa0 1/218-219).\nBased on that:\nThis blood is not menses, but it does invalidate wudu’. If it is ongoing, then it is istihadah (irregular bleeding).\nFor information on the rulings on istihadah, please see the answer to question no. 68810 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/418542/bleeding-that-occurs-after-an-egg-retrieval-procedure-does-it-necessitate-ghusl
140931,"A woman is asking, after having repented to Allah for wealth that she accumulated through begging: This wealth includes two dwellings for my children and some small businesses. Please note that she is a widow and has no income.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly: undoubtedly begging and asking of people when one is not in need is haram.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: There are mutawatir hadiths from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) which indicate that it is prohibited to ask of people except in the case of necessity.""(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa\xa0 8/538).\nWe have previously discussed the prohibition on begging and the circumstances in which it is permissible, and the evidence for that, in the answer to question no. 104781 .\nSecondly: the wealth that has been accumulated through begging and asking of people without being in need is unlawful wealth, because it was taken in a manner that is not permissible according to Islamic teachings, as the one who gave it in charity to the beggar only gave it to him because he thought that the one who was asking for it was in need and poor.\nBased on that, this woman must get rid of this wealth by spending it on charitable causes and giving it to the poor and needy on behalf of those who donated it.\nWhatever has been spent of this wealth, no action is required regarding it.\nIf the woman is in need, then she may take of it as much as she needs and will suffice her. That includes what she has bought with this money of dwellings and shops and the like. But she should limit it to as much as she and her children need, and get rid of the rest.\nPlease see the answer to question no. 78289 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/140931/she-accumulated-wealth-through-begging-and-built-her-house-with-it-how-can-she-repent
