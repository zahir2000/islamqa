Sometimes there is competition in this regard, whereby the representative will try to give additional free items to the pharmacist so that he will order from him. What is the ruling on that?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThere is nothing wrong with pharmaceutical companies offering discounts on the price of medicines to pharmacies, or offering free medicines when the pharmacy purchases a specific amount, by way of encouraging the pharmacies to buy from them.\nIbn Rushd said: Some scholars are of the view, based on their interpretation of this report of Ibn al-Qasim and similar reports, that one or two of the merchants in the marketplace do not have the right to sell goods more cheaply than the other merchants, because that harming them. Among those who hold this view are Abu Muhammad ‘Abd al-Wahhab ibn Nasr al-Baghdadi, but this view is clearly wrong, because no one should be blamed for being easy-going in selling and lowering prices; rather he is to be thanked for that, if he does it for the sake of people, and he will be rewarded for that if he does it for the sake of Allah.""(Al-Bayan wa’l-Tahsil\xa0\xa09/306).\nSecondly:\nFrom a juristic (fiqhi) perspective regarding the gifts that salesmen offer for marketing purposes, we have previously explained that the best of what has been said concerning that from a juristic perspective is one of two scenarios:\nThe first scenario is that it is a pure gift that the seller gives to encourage the purchaser to buy his product, and the buyer accepts it as such – that is, as a gift – and the price does not change as a result.\nThe second scenario is that it is part of the sales deal, and is subject to the general rulings on buying and selling.\nWe have previously mentioned these two ways of looking at it, and explained that the second one is the better way to look at this issue, in the answer to question no. 385767.\nFor more information, please see also the answer to question no. 194359 .\nThirdly:\nThe sales rep has no right to do that without the permission of his company, because he is in a position of trust regarding the pharmaceutical products that he has in his possession, and the way in which he handles them is subject to permission.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The proxy does not have the right to dispose of anything except in accordance with what is dictated by the permission given by the one who appointed him, either based on what he said to him or based on what is acceptable according to custom, because his handling of it is based on the permission of the owner, so it is limited to what he has permitted.

14250,"Why do we have to love, obey, follow and venerate our Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) the most (or more than any other person)?","[""Praise be to Allah.Muslims love Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) the most for the following reasons:\n\nAllah has commanded us to obey the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n\n“And obey Allah and the Messenger (Muhammad), and beware (of evil) and fear Allah. Then if you turn away, you should know that it is Our Messenger’s duty to convey (the Message) in the clearest way.”\xa0[Al-Ma'idah 5:92]\n\nAllah has told us that obedience to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is obedience to Allah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n\n“He who obeys the Messenger (Muhammad), has indeed obeyed Allah, but he who turns away, then we have not sent you (O Muhammad) as a watcher over them.”\xa0[An-Nisa’ 4:80]\xa0\n\nAllah has warned us against failing to obey him, and that this may lead a Muslim into a trial that is the trial of Shirk (associating partners with Allah). Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Do not make [your] calling of the Messenger among yourselves as the call of one of you to another. Already Allāh knows those of you who slip away, concealed by others. So let those who dissent from his [i.e., the Prophet's] order [way or sunnah] beware , lest fitnah [trials or affliction] strike them or a painful punishment..”\xa0[An-Nur 24:63]\xa0\xa0\xa0\n\nAllah has told us that the status of Prophethood which He gave to His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) requires the believers to respect and venerate the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Verily, We have sent you (O Muhammad) as a witness, as a bearer of glad tidings, and as a warner. In order that you (O mankind) may believe in Allah and His Messenger, and that you assist and honour him, and (that you) glorify (Allah’s) praises morning and afternoon.”\xa0[Al-Fath 48:8-9]\xa0\n\nThe Muslim’s faith cannot be complete unless he loves the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and until the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is dearer to him than his father, his son, his own self and all the people. It was narrated that Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No one of you will truly believe until I am dearer to him than his father, his son, his own self and all the people.”\xa0(Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 15; Muslim, 44).\xa0\n\n`Abdullah ibn Hisham (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “We were with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when he was holding the hand of `Umar ibn Al-Khattab. `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said to him: “O Messenger of Allah, you are dearer to me than everything except my own self.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No, by the One in Whose hand is my soul, (you will not have complete faith) not until I am dearer to you than your own self.” `Umar said to him: “Now, by Allah, you are dearer to me than my own self.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Now (you are a true believer), O `Umar.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 6257)\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“The reason why it is obligatory to love the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and venerate him more than any other person is that we cannot attain what is good in this world and in the Hereafter except through the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), by believing in him and following him. That is because no one can be saved from the punishment of Allah, and the mercy of Allah cannot reach him except by means of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), by believing in him, loving him, being loyal to him and following him. This is the means by which Allah will save him from punishment in this world and in the Hereafter. This is the means by which he will attain what is good in this world and in the Hereafter. The greatest blessing is the blessing of faith, which can only be attained through him, and which is more beneficial (to the person) than his own self and his wealth. He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the one by means of whom Allah brings people forth from darkness into light, and there is no other way to Allah. As for a person’s self and family, they will not avail him anything before Allah…” (Majmu’ Al-Fatawa, 27/246)\xa0\nOne of the scholars said:\n“If a person thinks of the benefits that he has been given through the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), through whom Allah brought him forth from the darkness of disbelief into the light of faith, he will realise that he is the cause of his soul will remain forever in eternal bliss, and he will understand that this benefit is greater than all others. So he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) deserves that his share of a person’s love should be greater than anyone else’s. However, people vary with regard to that, depending on the extent to which they bear that in mind or neglect it. Everyone who truly believes in the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) will inevitably have a strong love for him , but they differ in the extent and depth of their love for him. Some of them have a great deal of love for him and some have only a little, like those who are absorbed in their own whims and desires most of the time. But when mention of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is made, most of them long to see him, and prefer that over their own family, sons, wealth and fathers. But that feeling quickly fades because of other distractions. And Allah is the One Whose help we seek.”\xa0 (See Fath Al-Bari, 1/59)\xa0\nThis is what is referred to in the verse where Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“The Prophet is closer to the believers than their own selves.”\xa0[Al-Ahzab 33:6]\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“[Allah] knew how compassionate His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was towards his Ummah, and how sincere he was towards them, so He made him closer to them than their own selves, and decreed that his judgement among them should take precedence over their own preferences.” (Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 6/380)\xa0\nShaykh Ibn Sa’di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Allah tells the believers something by which they may understand the position and status of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), so that they might interact with him appropriately. So He said: “The Prophet is closer to the believers than their own selves”, the closest thing to a person and the most deserving of love is his own self. Yet, the Messenger is closer to him than his own self, because he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was so kind and sincere and compassionate towards the believers. He was the kindest and most merciful of mankind. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did the greatest of favours to all of mankind. Not the slightest good came to them and not the slightest harm was warded off from them except through him. Hence if there is a conflict between what a person himself wants or what other people want, and what the Messenger wants, then what the Messenger wants must take precedence. What the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) says cannot be overridden by what any person says, no matter who he is. They should sacrifice their selves, their wealth and their children, and put love for him before their love for all others.”\xa0\nWhat the scholars have said may be summed up by noting that the wrath of Allah and the Fire of Hell are the things that we fear the most, and we cannot be saved from them except through the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The pleasure of Allah and the garden of Paradise are the things that we want the most, but we cannot attain them except through the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).\xa0\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) referred to the former (i.e., being saved from Hell) when he said: “The likeness of me and you is that of a man who lit a fire and grasshoppers and moths started falling into it, and he tried to push them away. I am seizing your waistbands and trying to pull you away from the Fire but you are trying to get away from me.”\xa0(Muslim, 2285, from the Hadith of Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him); a similar Hadith was narrated by Al-Bukhari, 3427 from the Hadith of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him)).\xa0\nWhat is meant by this Hadith is that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) likened the way in which the ignorant and disobedient rush to fall into the Fire of the Hereafter by means of their sins and following their whims and desires, and their keenness to fall into that Fire, even though he is trying hard to prevent them from doing so, to the way in which moths and other insects are fatally attracted to the fire. Both of them are keen to destroy themselves because of their ignorance of the consequences.\xa0(Sharh Muslim by An-Nawawi)\xa0\nThe latter (i.e., entering Paradise) was referred to by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when he said: “All of my Ummah will enter Paradise except those who refuse.” They said: “O Messenger of Allah, who would refuse?” He said: “Whoever obeys me will enter Paradise and whoever disobeys me has refused.”\xa0(Al-Bukhari, 7280, from the Hadith of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him))""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/14250/why-must-we-love-the-prophet-muhammad
473749,"Hello. I would like to ask you, I am secretly Muslim and am hiding my faith from my Christian family. Is it regarded as disbelief (kufr) if I tell them “I am Christian”?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nWe congratulate you, our Muslim sister, for what Allah has honoured you with and blessed you with, and for His opening your heart to guidance and the religion of truth. This is the greatest blessing that has been bestowed upon you since your mother gave birth to you, so you should praise Allah greatly and ask your Lord to make you steadfast in adhering to guidance and the religion of truth so long as you remain in this world, and to grant you a good end, and thus grant you the best in both this world and the hereafter. We also give you the glad tidings that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) gave to anyone who believes in the religion of Islam and follows its Prophet, and was a believer in a previous Book, whether he was a Jew or a Christian.\nIt was narrated from Abu Musa al-Ash‘ari (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There are three who will be given a double reward: a man from among the people of the Book who believed in his Prophet, then lived to see the Prophet (S) and followed him and believed in him– he will have a double reward…”\nNarrated by al-Bukhari (3011) and Muslim (154).\nSecondly:\nUndoubtedly one of the greatest difficulties that the new Muslim may face is confronting his family and social circle who are following a religion other than Islam. This may be more difficult and more vicious in Arab countries and eastern countries in general, to the extent that it may lead to pressure to give up his religion and attempts to make him recant by any possible means. But these concerns about family opposition and social pressure should be analysed within a proper framework, which will help you to plan your next step and will help you to remain steadfast with strong resolve to persevere and do everything that is required of you.\nThis is akin to the traveller’s concerns about the risks of travel, and the troubles and difficulties he will face, but he has no choice but to start his journey. Therefore he takes appropriate measures, prepares his provisions and chooses his travel companion, then he sets out… Despite the fears, people still travel.\nAnd it is akin to the concerns of the sick person who is about to die, and faces surgeries and treatments in which there may be a great deal of pain and fear, but he has no choice but to bear that with patience, or else he is going to die.\nYour need to start your journey towards the Lord of the Worlds surpasses the need of all these people (travellers and sick people); it surpasses the need of one who is about to drown and die, then a lifebelt is thrown to him; it surpasses the need of the thirsty person for cool water on a hot day; it surpasses any need that any human could think of or imagine.\nThirdly:\nWhen we understand the pressure of the social environment, we will realise that this environment will, in many instances, force you to conceal your Islam and even make you pretend to others that you are still following their religion. So there is no blame on you if you tell them that you are a “Christian” and – in such cases – you will be regarded as one who had no choice and was compelled to do that. Allah, may He be exalted, says by way of giving a concession to His slaves (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Those who disbelieve in Allah after having believed – except one who is compelled while his heart remains steadfast in faith – and willingly open their hearts to disbelief, upon them will be the wrath of Allah, and theirs will be a grievous punishment}\xa0[Al-Nahl 16:106].\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Regarding the words {except one who is compelled while his heart remains steadfast in faith}, this is an exception from what is mentioned at the beginning of the verse, for the one who only utters words in order to go along with the polytheists verbally, under duress, because of what he has suffered of beatings and harm, but in his heart he rejects what he is saying and he remains steadfast in his belief in Allah and His Messenger.\nAl-‘Awfi narrated from Ibn ‘Abbas that this verse was revealed concerning ‘Ammar ibn Yasir, when the polytheists tortured him in order to make him disbelieve in Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and he went along with them in that unwillingly, \xa0because he was forced to do so. He came and apologised to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), then Allah revealed this verse. This was stated by al-Sha‘bi, Abu Malik and Qatadah.\nIbn Jarir said: Ibn ‘Abd al-A‘la told us: Muhammad ibn Thawr told us, from Ma‘mar, from ‘Abd al-Karim al-Jazari, from Abu ‘Ubaydah ibn Muhammad ibn ‘Ammar ibn Yasir, who said: The polytheists seized ‘Ammar ibn Yasir and tortured him until he gave them some of what they wanted. He complained about that to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “How do you find your heart?” He said: It is steadfast in faith. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If they do that again, then do the same thing again.”\nAl-Bayhaqi narrated a more detailed report, in which it says that he reviled the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and spoke well of their gods, and that he said: O Messenger of Allah, I was not left alone until I reviled you and spoke well of their gods. He said: \xa0“How do you find your heart?” He said: It is steadfast in faith. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If they do that again, then do the same thing again.” Concerning that, Allah revealed the words (interpretation of the meaning): {except one who is compelled while his heart remains steadfast in faith}.""(Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 4/605).\nThe best for you is to intend, every time you say that you are a “Christian”, that you are one of the followers of the Messiah ‘Isa ibn Maryam (Jesus son of Mary – peace be upon him), for the Messiah ‘Isa (peace be upon him) was a monotheist and a Muslim, and he did not bring the religion of the cross; he did not want the people to worship him instead of Allah.\nAllah may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{When Allah says: O ‘Isa son of Maryam, did you say to people: Take me and my mother as two gods besides Allah? He [‘Isa] will say: Glory be to You! It would not have been proper for me to say that which I had no right [to say]. If I had said it, You would surely have known it. You know all that I know, whereas I do not know what You know. Verily, You alone are the Knower of the unseen.\nI said nothing to them except that which You commanded me [to say]: Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord. I watched over them whilst I was amongst them, then when You took me up to You, You [alone] were the Watcher over them, and You are Witness over all things}\xa0[Al-Ma’idah 5:116-117].\nThe Messiah (peace be upon him) foretold the coming of the Prophet of Islam and his religion, and he took a covenant from his people that they would follow the Prophet of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nBut those among the Jews and Christians who associate others with Allah are the ones who concealed his prophecies and went against the covenant with him.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And [remember] when ‘Isaâ ibn Maryam said: O Children of Israel, verily I am the Messenger of Allah to you, confirming what came before me of the Torah, and bringing glad tidings of a Messenger to come after me, whose name will be Ahmad. But when he came to them with clear signs, they said: This is obviously magic!\nWho does greater wrong than he who fabricates lies against Allah when he is called to Islam? And Allah does not guide people who are given to wrongdoing.\nThey want to extinguish Allah’s light with their utterances, but Allah will perfect His light, even though the disbelievers hate it}\xa0[Al-Saff 61:6-9].\nWhatever the case, there is no blame on you if you say these words to your family or those from whom you fear trouble regarding your religion in your social circle.

10447,"I checked the Holy Quran in regards to how to make a will. It's kind of complicated for me, that's why I am hoping you can help me Insha Allah.","['Praise be to Allah.What is a gift in Islam?\nThere is a difference between a will and a gift. Property that is willingly given away while one is alive is considered to be a gift, which does not come under the same rulings as a will. However, it should be noted that it is not permissible for a person to give a gift to some of his children and not others, or to favour some of them over others in gift-giving . Rather they must be treated fairly, because of the hadith of An-Nu`man ibn Bashir, who said that his father brought him to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), when he gave him a gift, to ask the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to bear witness to it. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked, “Have you given something similar to all your children?” He said, “No.” He said, “Then take it back.” Then he said: “Fear Allah and treat your children fairly.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, Al-Hibah, 2398)\xa0\nWhat is a will in Islam?\nWith regard to the will , it is a set of instructions on how (one’s property) is to be disposed of after one’s death, or how it is to be given away after one’s death.\xa0\nThe evidence that this (writing a will) is prescribed in Islam is found in the Quran and Sunnah, and the consensus of the scholars. Allah says (interpretation of the meanings):\xa0\n“It is prescribed for you, when death approaches any of you, if he leaves wealth, that he makes a bequest to parents and next of kin, according to reasonable manners. (This is) a duty upon the pious.” [Al-Baqarah 2:180]\xa0\n“(The distribution in all cases is) after the payment of legacies he may have bequeathed or debts.” [An-Nisa’ 4:11]\xa0\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah was being generous to you when He allowed you to give one-third of your wealth (in charity) when you die, to increase your good deeds.” (Narrated by Ibn Majah, Al-Wasaya, 2700; classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih Sunan Ibn Majah, no. 2190)\xa0\nThe scholars unanimously agreed that writing a will is permissible.\xa0\nHow to write a will in Islam\nWriting a will may be obligatory with regard to the dues\xa0 one owes to others where there is no proof, lest they be lost or neglected. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “It is not permissible for any Muslim who has something concerning which a will should be made to stay for two nights without having his last will written and kept ready with him.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, Al-Wasaya 2533)\nIt is recommended for a man to write a will that some of his wealth be used for charitable purposes , so that the reward for that may reach him after his death. So Allah granted permission for a person to dispose of one third of his wealth for that purpose when death approaches.\xa0\nIt is permitted to write a will concerning one third or less. Some of the scholars said it is preferable for it to be less than one-third, and the will does not apply to any of the heirs . The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No bequest is to be made to an heir.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, Al-Wasaya, 2047; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Sunan At-Tirmidhi, 1722). If the will is intended to harm the heirs or make things difficult for them, then that is prohibited, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“…so that no loss is caused (to anyone).” [An-Nisa’ 4:12]\xa0\nThe will comes into effect when the person dies. It is permissible for the person who writes the will to revoke it or cancel it or revoke part of it. Carrying out the will is an important matter which was confirmed by Allah and mentioned before other things, and there is a stern warning issued to those who change it.\xa0\nWith regard to the distribution of personal belongings, he does not have the right to state how they should be distributed after he dies , because the share of each heir has been defined by Allah, and He has explained who inherits and who does not inherit. So it is not permitted for any person to transgress the limits set by Allah, because Allah has warned against doing that. Allah says in Surat An-Nisa’ (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Allah commands you as regards your children’s (inheritance): to the male, a portion equal to that of two females; if (there are) only daughters, two or more, their share is two-thirds of the inheritance; if only one, her share is a half. For parents, a sixth share of inheritance to each if the deceased left children; if no children, and the parents are the (only) heirs, the mother has a third; if the deceased left brothers or (sisters), the mother has a sixth. (The distribution in all cases is) after the payment of legacies he may have bequeathed or debts. You know not which of them, whether your parents or your children, are nearest to you in benefit; (these fixed shares) are ordained by Allah. And Allah is Ever All-Knower, All-Wise.\nIn that which your wives leave, your share is a half if they have no child; but if they leave a child, you get a fourth of that which they leave after payment of legacies that they may have bequeathed or debts. In that which you leave, their (your wives) share is a fourth if you leave no child; but if you leave a child, they get an eighth of that which you leave after payment of legacies that you may have bequeathed or debts. If the man or woman whose inheritance is in question has left neither ascendants nor descendants, but has left a brother or a sister, each one of the two gets a sixth; but if more than two, they share in a third, after payment of legacies he (or she) may have bequeathed or debts, so that no loss is caused (to anyone). This is a Commandment from Allah; and Allah is Ever All-Knowing, Most-Forbearing.\nThese are the limits (set by) Allah (or ordainments as regards laws of inheritance), and whosoever obeys Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad) will be admitted to Gardens under which rivers flow (in Paradise), to abide therein, and that will be the great success.\nAnd whosoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad), and transgresses His limits, He will cast him into the Fire, to abide therein; and he shall have a disgraceful torment.” [An-Nisa’ 4:11-14]\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.\xa0\nFor more information, please see Al-Mulakhkhas Al-Fiqhi by Salih Al-Fawzan, 2/172-182\xa0\nThere is no reason why you should not give your nephews and nieces whatever you want of your wealth while you are alive. As they are not your own children, you are not obliged to give to them all equally. You can give gifts to those whom you love and to whomever you wish, or to whoever among them is according to his or her need. Try to give to those who are religiously committed in ways that will help them to obey Allah. It is also permitted to bequeath to them one-third or less of your wealth so long as they are not your heirs.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10447/how-to-write-a-will-in-islam
