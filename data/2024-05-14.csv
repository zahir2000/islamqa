382372,What is the meaning of this part of a lengthy hadith,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe Sunnah indicates that people will see their Lord on the Day of Resurrection during the reckoning, and the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) will see Him when he intercedes for creation at the time of judgment. This is the first vision.\nThen, when the disbelievers are taken to the Fire, and this Ummah remains, including its hypocrites, Allah will come to them in a form different from the one they saw Him in the first time, and this is a test and trial for them. He will ask them what they are waiting for, and they will say they are waiting for their Lord. He will ask if there is a sign between them and Him, and they will say: the Shin. Then He will reveal His Shin, and the believers will prostrate. When they raise their heads, they will see Him in His first form.\nAs for the first vision: it is evidenced by the Hadith of `Adi ibn Hatim reported by Al-Bukhari (1413) which includes the Prophet\'s statement (peace and blessings be upon him): ""Then each one of you will stand before Allah without a veil or an interpreter to translate for him,"" and the Hadith of Abu Hurairah reported by Muslim (2968): ""Then the servant will meet [Allah], and He will say: \'O so-and-so, did I not honor you, and make you a leader, and marry you, and subjugate horses and camels for you, and allow you to be in charge and to have comfort?\' He will say: \'Yes.\' [Allah] will say: \'Did you think that you would meet Me?\' He will say: \'No.\' [Allah] will say: \'Then I will forget you as you forgot Me.\'"" The meeting includes seeing, then the veiling occurs for the disbelievers. See: Majmu` Al-Fatawa by Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (6/462-468).\nAnd in the Hadith of Anas regarding intercession reported by Al-Bukhari (7440) and Muslim (193): ""Then I will ask permission to approach my Lord, and permission will be granted to me. When I see Him, I will fall prostrate..."" This confirms the Prophet\'s (peace and blessings be upon him) vision of his Lord on the Day of Resurrection before Allah comes to the believers in a different form, and it reinforces the affirmation of the first vision.\nIt has been reported by Ahmad (15), Ibn Khuzaymah in At-Tawhid (2/735), and Ibn Hibban (6476) from the Hadith of Hudhayfah about Abu Bakr: ""...go to Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him), so he may intercede for you with your Lord, the Mighty and Majestic. He said: \'Then he will go, and Jibril (peace be upon him) will come to his Lord, and Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, will say: \'Grant him permission, and give him the glad tidings of Paradise.\' He said: \'Then Jibril will take him, and he will fall prostrate for the duration of a Friday, and Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, will say: \'Raise your head, O Muhammad, speak and you will be heard, and intercede and your intercession will be accepted.\' He said: \'Then he will raise his head, and when he looks at his Lord, the Mighty and Majestic, he will fall prostrate for the duration of another Friday, and Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, will say: \'Raise your head, speak and you will be heard, and intercede and your intercession will be accepted.\'"" And its chain of narration is sound as stated by Sheikh Shu`aib Al-Arnaut in his verification of Ibn Hibban.\nAnd Ibn Hibban (6480) reported from the Hadith of Anas: ""Then his Lord will manifest to him, and no prophet before him will have seen Him. He will fall prostrate to Allah, and praise Him with praises that no one before him has praised Him with, and no one after him will praise Him with."" And its chain of narration is sound.\nAs for the second and third visions: in the Hadith of Abu Sa`id reported by Muslim (183): ""...the Lord of the Worlds, Glorified and Exalted, will come to them in a form not recognisable to them. He will say: \'What are you waiting for? Every nation will follow what they used to worship.\' They will say: \'Our Lord, we parted with people in the world when we were most in need of them, and we did not accompany them.\' He will say: \'I am your Lord.\' They will say: \'We seek refuge with Allah from you; we do not associate anything with Allah.\' This will happen two or three times, until some of them are almost turned away. He will say: \'Is there a sign between you and Him by which you will recognize Him?\' They will say: \'Yes.\' Then the Shin will be revealed, and no one who used to prostrate to Allah of his own accord will remain except that Allah will permit him to prostrate, and no one who used to prostrate out of fear and showing off will remain except that Allah will make his back a single plate, every time he tries to prostrate, he will fall on his back. Then they will raise their heads, and He will have changed into the form they saw Him in the first time. He will say: \'I am your Lord.\' They will say: \'You are our Lord.\' Then the bridge will be set over Hell.""\nAnd in the Hadith of Abu Sa`id reported by Al-Bukhari: ""He said: \'Then the Compeller will come to them in a form other than the one they saw Him in the first time. He will say: \'I am your Lord.\' They will say: \'You are our Lord.\' And no one will speak to Him except the prophets. He will say: \'Is there a sign between you and Him that you recognize?\' They will say: \'The Shin.\' Then He will reveal His Shin, and every believer will prostrate to Him, and those who used to prostrate to Allah out of showing off and seeking reputation will remain, and when they go to prostrate, their backs will become one plate."" Meaning their backbones will become even, and they will not be able to bow for prostration.\nThe form in which Allah comes to His servants is unknown to us; it is part of the unseen that He has not informed us about. We believe in it and submit, and we do not indulge in our whims, nor do we imagine, nor do we liken, nor do we represent, for He, Glorified be He, ""cannot be grasped by the minds through contemplation, nor can the hearts imagine Him through picturing, {There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing} [Ash-Shura: 11]."" End quote from Lum`at Al-I`tiqad by Ibn Qudamah, p. 5.\nSecondly:\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) affirmed that this light is the light of the veil, saying: ""The light with which He veiled Himself is called light and fire, as there is hesitation in its expression in the authentic Hadith, the Hadith of Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari, which is his statement: \'His veil is light or fire.\' Indeed, this fire is light, and it is the one in which Allah spoke to His messenger Moses, and it is a pure fire that has brightness without burning."" End quote from Mukhtasar As-Sawa`iq, p. 423.\nAnd the fact that the light in the tree is the light of Allah the Almighty does not contradict His highness above His Throne, but it indicates closeness to what is below the heavens.\nShaykh Al-Islam (may Allah have mercy on him) said: ""And if the caller is Allah, Lord of the Worlds, and He called him from a specific place and brought him close; this indicates what the Salaf said: of His closeness and nearness to Musa (peace be upon him); even though this closeness is from what is below the heavens."" End quote from Majmu` Al-Fatawa (5/464).\nAnd what is well-known about the descent among the Salaf is that they say: He descends without the Throne being empty of Him, and this indicates that His descent is not like the descent of the created beings, Glorified and Exalted be He, and Sanctified. He descends to the lowest heaven and there is nothing above Him, and no one knows how He descends except Him, Glorified be He.\nAnd Shaykh Al-Islam (may Allah have mercy on him) said: ""And the basis of this: that His closeness - Glorified be He - and His nearness to some of His creatures, does not necessitate that His essence is empty from above the Throne. Rather, He is above the Throne, and He draws near to His creation as He wills, as those who said it from the Salaf said, and this is like His closeness to Musa when He spoke to him from the tree."" End quote from Sharh Hadith An-Nuzul, p. 99.\nAnd it does not entail any problematic issue such as something encompassing Him, but He, the Exalted, is high in His nearness, above everything.\nFor this reason, Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said in this context: ""And His statement (translation of the meaning): {And Glorified be Allah, Lord of the Worlds} means:\xa0 He who does what He wills and does not resemble any of His creatures, and nothing of His creations encompasses Him, and He is the Most High, the Great, distinct from all creatures, and the earth and the heavens do not contain Him, but He is the One, the Eternal Refuge, sanctified from resembling the created things."" End quote from Tafsir Ibn Kathir (6/180).\nThirdly:\nMusa (peace be upon him) did not see his Lord, and Allah is exalted above taking the form of fire or a human, for Allah, Glorified be He, is unlike anything.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/382372/the-hadith-about-allah-coming-in-a-form-muslims-do-not-recognize
127141,"Is this Hadith authentic: “At the time of sunset, we say Bismillah and close the windows so that the jinn will not enter”?","['Praise be to Allah.It is narrated in an authentic report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded us to close the doors and mention the name of Allah at night, when night begins, when going to sleep. That is so that the Muslim may protect his house and his family from any harmful devil coming in, whether from among mankind or the jinn, and from harmful animals or insects coming in.\nIt was narrated from Jabir ibn `Abd-Allah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:\xa0\n“When the wings of the night spread – or when evening comes – keep your children in, for the devils come out at that time. Then when part of the night has passed, let them go. And close the doors and mention the name of Allah, for the devil does not open a closed door. And tie up your waterskins and mention the name of Allah, and cover your vessels and mention the name of Allah, even if you only put something over them, and extinguish your lamps.”\xa0(Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 3280 and Muslim, 2012). A version narrated by Muslim says:\xa0“Cover vessels, tie up waterskins, close doors and extinguish lamps, for the devil does not undo waterskins or open doors or uncover vessels.”\xa0\nImam An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) included this in a chapter entitled:\xa0\n“Chapter of the command to cover vessels, tie up waterskins, close doors and mention the name of Allah over them, extinguish lamps and fires when going to sleep, and keep children and livestock in after sunset.”\xa0\nMuslim (2013) narrated in the same chapter that Jabir ibn `Abd-Allah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not let your animals and children go out when the sun has set, until the first part of the night is over, for the devils come out when the sun sets, until the first part of the night is over.”\xa0\nIbn Hibban narrated it in his Sahih (4/90) as follows:\xa0\n“Tie up your water skins and close your doors when you go to bed at night, and cover food and drink, for the devil comes, and if he does not find the door closed he will enter, and if he does not find the waterskin tied up he will drink from it, and if he finds the door closed and the waterskin tied up, he does not open any water skin and he does not open a closed door, and if one of you cannot find something to cover his vessel in which is his drink, let him a place a stick over it.”\xa0\nImam Ibn `Abd Al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“In this Hadith there is a command to close doors of houses at night. This is a Sunnah which is enjoined to protect people against the devils of mankind and the jinn. As for the words “the devil does not open a closed door and he does not untie a water skin” this is telling us of the blessing of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, to his human slaves, for he (the devil)\xa0 has not been given the power to open the door, or undo a water skin or uncover a vessel; these things have been forbidden to him, even though he has been given the power to do some things that are more difficult than that, such as going through and penetrating in ways that man cannot.” (Al-Istidhkar, 8/363)\xa0\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Ibn Daqiq Al-`Eid said: in the command to close doors there are both religious and worldly benefits which protect lives and wealth from evildoers, and especially the devils.\xa0\nAs for the words “the devil does not open a closed door,” this is an indication that the command to close doors serves the purpose of keeping the devil away from mixing with people. The reason given is something that can be known through Revelation. The definite article is referring to the type, it does not mean any specific individual.” (Fath Al-Bari, 11/87)\xa0\nHe also said (may Allah have mercy on him):\xa0\n“Al-Qurtubi said: All commands on this issue are aimed at serving an interest for man, and are to be understood as recommendations, especially with regard to the one who does that with the intention of following the command.\xa0\nIbn Al-`Arabi said: Some people think that the command to close doors is general and is applicable to all times, but that is not the case. Rather it is limited to the night. It is as if the night is singled out in this case because the day is usually the time when people are awake, unlike the night. The whole idea is connected to the devil, because he is the one who makes the mouse burn the house.” (Fath Al-Bari, 6/356 -357)\xa0\nAl-Khatib Al-Shirbini Ash-Shafi`i (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“When night comes, it is Sunnah to cover vessels even if only with a stick, to tie up water skins, and to close doors, mentioning the name of Allah in all three cases, and to keep children and livestock in during the first part of the night, and to extinguish lamps when going to sleep.” (Mughni Al-Muhtaj, 1/31)\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“When going to sleep, one should close the door.” (Sharh Riyadh As-Salihin)\xa0\nFor more details, please refer to the following answers: 10513 , 42073 , 97221 and 146797 .\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/127141/is-it-sunnah-to-close-the-doors-at-night
106563,Is it permissible for the pilgrim in Ihram to do ghusl for the sake of cleanliness? Is it permissible for him to change his Ihram garments?,"['Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\nIt is permissible for the pilgrim in Ihram to do Ghusl for the sake of cleanliness, because it is proven that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did Ghusl when he was in Ihram.\xa0\nIt is also permissible for the pilgrim in Ihram to change his Ihram garments for cleaner or newer ones.\xa0\nMoreover, it is permissible for him to enjoy using air conditioning and other means of comfort.” (Majmu` Fatawa Ibn `Uthaymin, 22/144)\nFor more details, please refer to the following links: 194704 , 112507 , 11356 , and 33738 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/106563/can-we-take-a-bath-after-wearing-ihram
363929,"can I be obedient to anyone or especially to my parents' request on something which I know will harm them? Let's say my mother asks me to bring her medicine that will stop her headache. But I know and anyone who studies these subjects a little bit knows that these products contain chemicals and other substances which are dangerous to the body. Similarly, if my mother asks me to bring her processed foods which contain sugar and other substances. How do I have to handle the situation? I feel like I know that these things that they ask me finally will cause them cancer, type 2 diabetes, high blood sugar, and other damages. What should I do?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nObedience to parents is obligatory in all permissible matters that are beneficial to them and do not cause harm to the child.\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: ""It is incumbent upon a person to obey his parents in matters other than sin, even if they (the parents) are sinful, and this is the apparent meaning of Ahmad\'s statement; this is in matters that are beneficial to them and not harmful. If it is difficult for him but does not harm him, it is obligatory, otherwise, it is not."" End quote from ""Al-Fatawa Al-Kubra"" (5/381).\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar stated regarding the definition of disobedience (`uquq): ""It refers to the occurrence of something that causes the parent to be hurt by their child, whether by word or deed, except in polytheism or sin, unless the parent is being unreasonable."" End quote from Fath Al-Bari (10/406).\nSecondly:\nManufactured medicines are not free from side effects that result from them. The principle of dealing with them is to weigh the benefits and harms. If their benefits and interests prevail, the harm is tolerated. If the harm prevails, they must be avoided; because one of the principles of Shari`ah is that ""harm is not removed by harm.""\nAnd if the benefit and harm are equal, this is a matter for consideration and Ijtihad.\nThe reference in this is to the doctors.\nMedicines – as is known – are not licensed for sale in pharmacies except after permission from the competent authorities, which means that they have undergone trials that prove their benefits are greater than the side effects they may cause, but these effects may increase for some individuals, so the doctor orders them to refrain from this medicine, and these are individual cases.\nTherefore, it is permissible to take medicines that contain chemical substances if the benefit is predominant, and this is the reality, as well as consuming manufactured foods that contain sugar or colors or preservatives, due to the predominance of their benefit, despite the presence of harm in them, but their harm is tolerable in light of their benefit.\nWe do not know of anyone from the scholars who has prohibited the consumption of what has been mentioned, so beware of prohibiting what Allah has permitted, and of speaking about Allah without knowledge. If medicines were to be completely abandoned due to their side effects, it would be necessary to eliminate most of them and leave people suffering from pain and the compounded effects resulting from the continuation and aggravation of the disease.\nIn conclusion:\nIf your parents order you to bring medicine prescribed for them by a doctor, then hasten to bring it, or if they order you to bring food containing sugar, then comply with their order; for they only command you with what is permissible, and they are hurt by your disobedience to them in that.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/363929/obedience-to-parents-in-bringing-them-medication
143056,Why do we recite Dhuhr and Asr prayer in low voice when it is clearly mentioned in the Quran the following?,"[""Praise be to Allah.Why are Dhuhr and `Asr prayers silent?\nIt was decreed that recitation in Dhuhr and `Asr should be done silently because the time of these prayers is during the day, and at that time a person's mind may be preoccupied with a lot of thoughts, as he is busy with his work or trade or manufacturing.\xa0\nIf the recitation were to be done out loud, his mind would be distracted and he would not listen attentively to the Imam’s recitation; he would not listen to it or devote his attention to it; rather other things would come to mind and distract him. So he was commanded to recite to himself so that his recitation will make him think and ponder.\xa0\nIt is well known that if people pray in congregation for Dhuhr or `Asr prayer, they should not recite out loud, because then they would distract one another. So both the Imam and those praying behind him are enjoined to recite silently.\xa0\nWhy are Fajr, Maghrib,\xa0 and `Isha prayers recited aloud?\nBut with regard to the prayers that are offered during the night , in most cases people are free from distractions so the Imam is enjoined to recite out loud, so that others may benefit from his recitation.\xa0\nRecitation in Qiyam Al-Layl and Tahajjud\nWith regard to the verse which reads: “Do not recite your prayers too loudly or silently, but seek a way between” (Al-Isra’ 17:110), it applies only to Qiyam Al-Layl and Tahajjud.\xa0\nIf a person is praying and there are people around him who are listening to his recitation and others who are asleep, then he should not recite so loudly as not to disturb those who are sleeping or so quietly as to cause those who are listening to him to miss out on any benefit; rather he should recite at a moderate volume, enough to be heard but not so loud as to disturb those who are asleep.\xa0\nIt also states in the verse that the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to recite out loud and the polytheists heard him and revealed the Quran and the one who had bought it, so he was forbidden to recite out loud and he began to recite silently, but then the members of his household and those who were listening to him missed out on the benefit, so he was enjoined to recite at a moderate volume.\xa0\nFor more details, please refer to the following answers: 26268 , 224152 , 197414 , 67618 , 114369 .\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/143056/why-are-dhuhr-and-asr-prayers-silent
