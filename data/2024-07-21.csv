130235,"During practical tests in medicine, we are asked to figure out the illness that the patient has. Sometimes the patient tells us what illness he has without the student asking. Is it permissible to write that down, or is that regarded as cheating, because he did not work it out himself? Likewise, if he hears it from any other person without asking him, can he write that down?","['Praise be to Allah.If the student knows the diagnosis and the patient tells him without him asking him, there is nothing wrong with the student writing down what he already knows. That is not regarded as cheating, because he knew the answer before the patient told him.\nBut if the student did not know the diagnosis, but the patient told him without him asking, or he found out the diagnosis from some of his colleagues without meaning to, such as if he overheard it, then in that case he must tell the doctor who is supervising the test what really happened. This is a precaution, and this is the best approach.\nHowever, if he benefitted from what he heard and wrote it in the test, then we hope that there is no blame on him, because he did not mean to do that. We heard our shaykh Muhammad ibn al-‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) being asked about a student in the exam hall who, without meaning to, heard the answer to a question that he did not know from other students nearby; is it permissible for him to write it or not?\nHe replied that it is permissible, because he did not deliberately commit a sin or infraction. He made an analogy with what the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said regarding one who is fasting: “Whoever forgets that he is fasting and eats or drinks, let him complete his fast, for Allah has fed him and given him to drink.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (1933) and Muslim (1155). According to the version narrated by ad-Daraqutni: “It is provision that Allah granted to him.” Ibn al-Qayyim said: This is a sahih isnad.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/130235/if-the-student-hears-the-answer-to-a-question-in-the-test-without-meaning-to-can-he-write-it
149336,"In the answer to question no. 60188 , it says: “If a person departs this world having won the pleasure of Allah, then he will have the glad tidings of all that is good after that… He will have all that he wishes for in the best ways. Everything that he asks for will be granted.","['Praise be to Allah.Are the delights of Paradise only for men?\nYou should understand that Paradise and its delights are not only for men, to the exclusion of women. Rather they are, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {prepared for the righteous} [Al `Imran 3:133] of both genders, as Allah, may He be exalted, tells us elsewhere (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And whoever does righteous deeds, whether male or female, while being a believer - those will enter Paradise and will not be wronged, [even as much as] the speck on a date seed.}\xa0[An-Nisa’ 4:124]\n{Whoever does righteousness, whether male or female, while he is a believer - We will surely cause him to live a good life, and We will surely give them their reward [in the Hereafter] according to the best of what they used to do.}\xa0[An-Nahl 16:97]\nWhen Allah mentions the delights that exist in paradise, namely different kinds of foods, beautiful scenery, dwellings and clothing, that includes both genders (male and female). Both will enjoy what is mentioned above.\nIt was narrated from Umm `Umarah Al-Ansariyyah that she came to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and said: I cannot see anything but it is for the men, and I do not see anything mentioned for women. Then this verse was revealed (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Indeed, the Muslim men and Muslim women, the believing men and believing women, the obedient men and obedient women, the truthful men and truthful women, the patient men and patient women, the humble men and humble women, the charitable men and charitable women, the fasting men and fasting women, the men who guard their private parts and the women who do so, and the men who remember Allah often and the women who do so - for them Allah has prepared forgiveness and a great reward.}\xa0[Al-Ahzab 33:35] (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi (3211); it is also in\xa0Sahih At-Tirmidhi\xa0(2565)\nBased on that, everything that is mentioned of the delights of Paradise is for both men and women equally.\nDescription of the women of Paradise\nAllah, may He be exalted, has described the women of Paradise as restraining or limiting their glances in three places in the Quran:\n\n{In them are women limiting [their] glances, untouched before them by man or jinni.}\xa0[Ar-Rahman 55:56]\n{And with them will be women limiting [their] glances, with large, [beautiful] eyes.}\xa0[As-Saffat 37:48]\n{And with them will be women limiting [their] glances and of equal age.}\xa0[Sad 38:52]\n\nThe commentators are of the view that what is meant is that they will restrain their glances, looking only at their husbands , and they will not want to look at anyone else; they will not see anyone in Paradise more handsome than their husbands. This was stated by Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah, `Ata’ Al-Khurasani, and Ibn Zayd.\nIt was narrated that one of them will say to her husband: By Allah I have not seen anything in Paradise more handsome than you, or anything in Paradise that is dearer to me than you. Praise be to Allah Who has made you for me and has made me for you. (Hadi Al-Arwah)\nThis sublime description and praise of the women of Paradise comes from Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, which indicates that the matter is not as you think, that a woman in Paradise will be longing for a man other than her husband, or that that will reduce her bliss in Paradise or spoil her joy therein. For Paradise is the abode of everlasting, eternal bliss, wherein there will be no worry, toil, distress or grief.\nThe fact that a man will have more than one wife in Paradise does not mean that there will be any shortcoming in the joy and pleasure of any of his wives, as is the case in this world, for the delights of Paradise are different from the delights of this world.\nThat includes what was narrated by Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), who said: “The believer in Paradise will be given such and such strength for sexual intercourse.” He was asked, “O Messenger of Allah, will he really be able to do that?” He said, “He will be given the strength of one hundred (men).” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi (2536). Al-Albani said: “It is authentic because of corroborating evidence.” (Mishkat Al-Masabih, 536)\nAccording to a Marfu` Hadith narrated by Zayd ibn Arqam: “By the One in Whose hand is my soul, one of them will be given the strength of a hundred men with regard to eating, drinking, desire and intercourse… (Narrated by Ahmad (18783); classed as authentic by Al-Albani in\xa0Sahih Al-Jami`, 1627)\nFor more details, please see the following answer:\xa011419 , 257509 , 8068 , 59896 , 173281 , and 160965 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/149336/how-many-husbands-will-a-woman-have-in-jannah
502471,"I started a partnership with a friend of mine, and after six months I wanted to introduce to the market a product that I had already started to develop myself without any contribution from my partner. But that was not very clear, even though in my own mind I thought that he understood from our conversation that I would sell to some of my own exclusive customers [and keep that profit for myself], and we would share the profit on what he sold, because I gave him the product. After one year, when we divided the assets of the company and dissolved the partnership, he asked me to pay him his share of what I had collected of profits. After referring the matter to an imam in our neighbourhood, I give him half of what I had collected from customers. Now there are outstanding debts still owed by customers whose accounts I was in charge of, and I intend to give him half of what they pay back to me. My question is about another type of customers; they are customers who were with me and I will continue to provide services to them. There are also other customers who spoke to me during that year [when the company was operating] but did not buy the product from me until after the partnership had been dissolved. Is he [my former partner] entitled to a share of the income from these customers on the grounds that I got to know them and they got in touch with me during the time of our partnership, or is it income in which he has no share, because we clearly changed the partnership, and those transactions were done after these changes were made to the partnership and it was dissolved?","['Praise be to Allah.Your question is not clear, and you should have explained what you meant by services and how they are connected to the products. If, for example, you sold a product during the lifetime of the company, and that product needs regular maintenance in return for fees, then a deal should have been made when dissolving the partnership to share these customers, or to agree on a specific way of dealing with those who bought these products, because these services are connected to the partnership, so neither partner should keep the customers and exclude the other partner.\nMoreover, if a product was offered to a customer during the lifetime of the company, and that took effort and time, but the sale was done after the dissolution of the partnership, then you must tell your former partner and reach an agreement with him to divide the profits, because the profits resulted from efforts made during the lifetime of the company.\nThis applies so long as the partners did not agree when dissolving the partnership that each partner would deal with whatever calls he received for maintenance, sales and so on, regardless of whether it was a continuation of the partner’s work during the lifetime of the company or not.\nBut generally speaking, if the partnership has ceased, there is nothing wrong with any of the partners dealing with former customers of the company, and there should be no restrictions on him. So no one should be told to end his connection with the customers or to get rid of customers’ phone numbers and the like. The partner has no right to stipulate that when dissolving the partnership.\nThe partner does not have to give away any of his profits to his former partner because he did business with some customers whom he came to know through the company. If it were to be suggested that that should be the case, this means that the partnership should still exist. But in principle partnership is not a permanently binding contract, and it has now been dissolved.\nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 417781 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/502471/doing-business-with-customers-of-the-company-after-the-partnership-has-been-dissolved
