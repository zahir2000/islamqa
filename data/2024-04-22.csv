257661,"I moved to the USA from Australia to be with my husband, I have been back and forth since 2014. I haven't been very unhappy lately in the marrige due to my rights not being fulfilled, I've seeked many counsilings with the Muslims in the community but my husband keeps violating my rights. I recently asked my husband for a divorce due to my rights constantly being violated in numerous ways but then I found out I am pregnant. My husband isn't able to provide for me or the child and depends on me and his mother to financially support him, we were recently homeless and staying in motels due to the fact that his mother didn't accept our marriage or respect our religious beliefes (she is not Muslim) and my parents had to send me $4000 just to get us off the street and put us in a place with funiture ect...because my husband wasn't able to do what he had to. in the USA I am not able to have any type of Financially easy healthcare which leaves me with very large bills and he expects me to pay all of this on my own. When My husband does have money he worries about himself first before me. I have the option to go back to my parents where myself and the child will be taking care of but that is back in Australia, I've given my husband the option to move to Australia but he doesn't want to leave the USA. Please can you provide any evidence and explanations to the evidence that it is ok for me to stay in Australia with the child due to the fact that he cannot provide for me?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe maintenance of the wife is mandatory upon the husband even if she is wealthy; due to the saying of Allah (translation of the meaning): Let a man of wealth spend from his wealth, and he whose provision is restricted - let him spend from what Allah has given him. Allah does not burden a soul beyond what He has given it. Allah will bring about, after hardship, ease. (At-Talaq 65:7), and His saying (translation of the meaning): But the father of the child shall bear the cost of the mother\'s food and clothing on a reasonable basis. (Al-Baqarah 2:233)\nAnd the saying of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) in his sermon during the Farewell Pilgrimage: “Fear Allah with regard to women, for you have taken them as a trust from Allah and intimacy with them has become permissible to you by the words of Allah. Your right over them is that they should not allow anyone to sit on your furniture whom you dislike; if they do that then hit them but not in a harsh manner. And their right over you is that you should provide for them and clothe them on a reasonable basis.”\xa0 Narrated by Muslim (1218).\nAnd his saying (peace and blessings be upon him) to Hind, the wife of Abu Sufyan: ""Take what is sufficient for you and your child on a reasonable basis."" Narrated by Al-Bukhari (5364).\nThe wife is not obliged to work, and if she does to assist her husband, she is doing good and volunteering.\nThe mandatory maintenance includes accommodation, food, drink, and clothing. It is estimated according to the condition of both spouses. If they are affluent, then she is entitled to the maintenance of the affluent; if they are in hardship, then she is entitled to the maintenance of those in hardship; if they are of moderate means, then she is entitled to the maintenance of those of moderate means; and if one of them is affluent and the other is in hardship, then she is entitled to the maintenance of those of moderate means, whether he is the affluent one or she is.\nThis is the opinion given by the Hanafis, the relied upon opinion among the Malikis, and the opinion of the Hanbalis, reconciling between the texts and considering the circumstances of both sides.\nSee: Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah (5/254).\nSecondly:\nIf the husband is unable to provide maintenance, the wife has the choice to be patient and stay with him, or to choose to leave him according to the majority of Jurists.\nIn Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah (41/66): ""They differed in the case where the husband is in hardship, and his wife is not pleased to stay with him, regarding her right to request separation between her and him, on two opinions:\nThe first opinion: She does not have the right to request separation, and the husband should not prevent her from earning to spend on herself. This was the opinion of Ibn Shubrumah, Hammad ibn Abi Sulayman, `Ata\', Az-Zuhri, Al-Hasan, Ibn Abi Layla, and others, and it is the opinion of the Hanafis...\nThe second opinion: The woman has the right to request separation from her husband due to his inability to provide maintenance, and if he refuses, the judge should separate them.\nThis is the opinion of the Malikis, the more apparent opinion among the Shafi`is, and the correct opinion among the Hanbalis.\nThis separation is considered dissolution (annulment) according to the Shafi`is and Hanbalis, and a revocable divorce according to the Malikis, and this is narrated from `Umar, Abu Hurairah, and Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with them), and it was the opinion of Sa`id ibn Al-Musayyib, Al-Hasan, Ishaq, Abu Thawr, and others.\nThey based this on the words of Allah (translation of the meaning): Then keep them in an acceptable manner or release them with good treatment.\xa0(Al-Baqarah 2:229), for Allah Almighty has commanded to keep the wife in a reasonable manner, or to release her with good treatment, and the husband\'s failure to provide for her negates keeping her in a reasonable manner, so the second option, which is releasing her with good treatment, becomes necessary.\nIt was narrated that `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) wrote to the commanders of the troops who were away from their wives in Madinah, ordering them to return to their wives. They could either divorce them or maintain the marriage, sending them maintenance. And whoever separated from their wives should send maintenance for what had passed.\nIt was narrated from Sa`id ibn Al-Musayyib that Abu Az-Zinad asked him about a man who does not find what to spend on his wife, he said: They should be separated. Abu Az-Zinad said: A Sunnah? He said: A Sunnah.\nAsh-Shafi`i said: And it seems that it is the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him).\nSince dissolution (annulment) is established due to inability to have intercourse, and the harm in it is less, then it is more fitting to be established due to inability to provide maintenance, which the body cannot do without"" End quote.\nThirdly:\nIf the wife chooses dissolution (annulment), then custody of her child is hers until the child reaches seven years of age, unless she travels or marries, then custody moves to the next in line, according to the difference among Jurists.\nThe majority of Jurists have gone to the opinion that the most entitled to custody after the mother is her mother - provided that she is also in the father\'s country. See: ""Al-Mughni"" (8/197), ""Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah"" (15/122).\nSomeome scholars have gone to the opinion that the father takes precedence over the mother\'s mother, and this is the preferred view of Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah and Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on them).The basis for this is the Hadith of `Abdullah ibn `Amr (may Allah be pleased with them) that a woman said: O Messenger of Allah, this son of mine was carried by my womb, suckled from my breast, and took refuge in my lap. His father has divorced me and wants to take him away from me?\nThe Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said to her: ""You are more entitled to him as long as you do not marry."" Narrated by Ahmad (6707) and Abu Dawud (2276), and Al-Albani graded it sound in Sahih Abu Dawud, and Ibn Kathir authenticated it in ""Irshad Al-Faqih"" (2/250).\nAs for the custodian\'s travel, it causes her to lose her right to custody; as it is in the child\'s best interest to be close to his father to see him and be cared for.\nIt is stated in ""Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah Al-Kuwaitiyyah"" (17/308-309):\n""The place of custody is the residence where the father of the custodian lives if the custodian is his mother\n\nand she is still married to him\n,or in her waiting period from a revocable or irrevocable divorce...\n\nIf the mother\'s waiting period is over, then the place of custody is the city where the father of the custodian or his guardian resides, and likewise if the custodian is not the mother, because the father has the right to see the custodian and supervise his upbringing, and this cannot be achieved unless the custodian resides in the city of the father or the guardian.\nThis is a shared view among the schools of thought, and it is what the Hanafis explicitly stated and what is indicated by the expressions of the other schools of thought"" End quote.\nFor benefit, please see the answer to question no. (8189 ).\nFourthly:\nIf the wife chooses to dissolve (annul) the marriage and separate from her husband, it is apparent that she has taken control of her affairs, and she may return to her country and reside where her family lives.\nHowever, if she does not choose dissolution (annulment), then it is not permissible for her to travel or leave the house without the permission of her husband, due to the general evidence indicating the necessity of her staying at home, the obligation of being with her husband, and seeking his permission to leave his house.\nHowever, with the husband\'s inability to provide, some Jurists said that he does not have the right to prevent her from working and earning.\nSee: Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti` (13/493).\nIn conclusion:\nIf the husband is unable to provide the mandatory maintenance, and you - the wife - are content with the continuation of the marriage: then you do not have the right to travel except with his permission and approval, so let there be understanding between you about what is best and most suitable.\nAnd the husband should take the means, seek permissible work, ask Allah Almighty for provision and help, and increase in righteous deeds, for they are among the means of provision, as Allah Almighty said (translation of the meaning): And whoever fears Allah - He will make for him a way out and will provide for him from where he does not expect. And whoever relies upon Allah - then He is sufficient for him. Indeed, Allah will accomplish His purpose. Allah has already set for everything a [decreed] extent.\xa0(At-Talaq 65:2-3).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/257661/moving-child-away-due-to-husbands-inability-to-maintain-them
45557,What is the ruling on shaving a man’s chest?,"['Praise be to Allah.Hair is of three types:\xa0\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 That which Shari`ah forbids us from removing any of it.\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 That which Shari`ah commands us to remove.\xa0\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 That concerning which Shari`ah says nothing; it does not tell us to remove it or forbids us to do so.\xa0\nThat which Shari`ah commands us to leave alone is the beard and eyebrows , from which nothing should be removed.\xa0\nThat which we are commanded to remove is armpit hair and pubic hair , and the moustache in the case of men.\xa0\nThat concerning which Shari`ah says nothing is forgivable (and is a matter of personal choice), because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “What is permitted is that which Allah has permitted in His Book, and what is forbidden is that which Allah has forbidden in His Book, and what He has remained silent about is forgivable.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 1726; classed as good by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Tirmidhi”\xa0\nThat includes hair in the nose, on the chest, and on the legs and arms.\xa0\nIt says in Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah (18/100):\xa0\n“With regard to shaving body hair in the case of a man, it is permissible according to the Malikis, and it was said that it is Sunnah.

481783,"If there is a woman that can not have children due any reason , would it be halal to use artificial womb to have children.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIf the wife is not able to get pregnant in the natural manner, there is nothing wrong with using artificial insemination or what is known as “test-tube babies”. This refers to fertilising the egg in a test tube, then implanting it in the wife’s uterus. That is subject to the condition that the sperm and egg come from the husband and wife respectively, and the fertilised egg is not implanted in the womb of another woman (surrogate pregnancy).\nIt says in a statement issued by the Islamic Fiqh Council during its seventh session in 1404 AH:\n“The third method is that in which the semen and egg from a man and woman who are married to one another are taken and fertilisation occurs externally, in a test tube, then the fertilised egg is implanted in the uterus of the wife, from whom the egg was taken. This method is acceptable in principle from an Islamic perspective, but it is not completely free of problems that could give rise to doubts concerning the procedure and the circumstances in which it is done. So it should not be resorted to except in cases of extreme necessity, after all the conditions referred to above are met.”\nThese conditions include:\n“C. In the case where uncovering the ‘awrah of the woman is permitted for a legitimate reason in front of someone with whom sexual intercourse is not permissible, the one who is providing treatment should be a Muslim woman, if possible. Otherwise, it should be a non-Muslim woman; if that is not possible then it should be a trustworthy male Muslim doctor; and if that is not possible, it may be a non-Muslim male. This is the order of preference.\nIt is not permissible for the treatment provider to be alone with the woman whom he is treating; rather her husband or another woman should also be present.\nThe Council has affirmed that the need of a married woman who cannot have children and the need of the husband to have children are regarded as legitimate needs that make it permissible to treat the woman in a permissible manner, using one of the methods of artificial insemination.""(Qararat al-Majma‘ al-Fiqhi bi Makkah al-Mukarramah, p. 149).\nSecondly:\nIf it is not possible to implant the fertilised egg in the uterus of the wife because she is suffering from uterine cancer, for example, then there comes to mind the idea of an artificial womb.\nDr. Muhammad ibn Ha’il al-Madhaji said: The idea [of the artificial womb] may be summed up as allowing the fertilised human egg to settle in an artificial womb by re-creating the natural environment of the woman’s uterus in a plastic incubator to enable the foetus to go through all the stages of development until it reaches the point of birth, whereby the foetus is placed in artificial fluid and its blood is supplied with oxygen. The foetus remains in that incubator, which guarantees all that is required for life and survival outside the uterus, until it is fully developed and the time comes for it to emerge.""(Ahkam an-Nawazil fi’l-Injab, p. 587).\nHe researched the ruling on this issue and mentioned different scholarly views, noting that most contemporary scholars who researched this issue were of the view that it is permissible. He quoted the evidence given by the two groups, and reached the following conclusions:\n1.. This idea is something that could never happen, because it is not possible to produce an environment that may be described as “a safe repository” (al-Mu’minun 23:13) like the natural womb, for the foetus to grow in. Even if science were able to produce such a thing, it is unlikely that the foetus would be safe and free from harm.\n2.. The view that it is haram is more likely to be correct, because it is contrary to the natural way that has been decreed by Allah, and there is great potential for harm.\nThe doctor mentioned that the goat foetuses that were subjected to experiments of this nature died a few days after birth, even though they grew in their mothers’ wombs except for the last three weeks before birth.\nSee: Ahkam an-Nawazil fi’l-Injab, p. 862.\nConclusion:\nThis method has not yet been proven to have been tried on humans as far as we know, let alone having been proven to be free of harm.\nWhat appears to be the case is that if it is proven to have been tried on humans, then in order for it to be permissible, the following conditions must be met:\n1.. It must meet the conditions of artificial insemination referred to above.\n2.. The tissues that are used to create the artificial womb must be permissible tissues and not haram; they should not be taken from anyone other than the husband and wife.\n3.. The procedure must be free of anything that could harm the foetus.\n4.. It should be not possible to implant the fertilised egg in the wife’s womb.\nWe re-affirm that surrogate pregnancy is haram, as stated previously in the answer to question no. 22126 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/481783/what-is-the-ruling-on-using-an-artificial-womb-to-have-children
224876,Who has the right to decide the amount of Mahr (dowry or gift given by groom to his bride during marriage or Nikah)? How much should it be? Is a marriage valid without Mahr?,"['Praise be to Allah.Who decides the amount of the Mahr?\nDeciding the amount of the Mahr is to be left to the woman and her guardian. If the woman disagrees with her guardian about the amount of the Mahr, then what appears to be the case from the words of the scholars is that they should take as a reference the Mahr of a woman of similar standing.\nIf she agrees to the Mahr of a woman of similar standing, but he (the guardian) wants more than that, then no attention should be paid to his wishes. If he is the one who wants a Mahr like that of a woman of similar standing, but she wants less than that, then what matters is his view.\xa0\nHow much should the Mahr be?\nWith regard to the amount of the Mahrf , there is no set limit. Rather it is whatever is agreed upon by the couple or by the husband and the woman’s guardian, whether it is small or great, but the Sunnah is to make the Mahr smaller and to be easy-going concerning this matter. This is the practice of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\xa0\nIs marriage valid without a Mahr?\nIt is essential to have a Mahr in the case of marriage. Once the amount of the Mahr has been agreed upon, at that point it becomes a right only for the woman, which the guardian must hand over to her, and not take anything from it except with her consent.\xa0\nAfter the marriage contract , it is permissible for her to give up to her husband all of the Mahr or part of it, on condition that she be of sound mind.\xa0\nIf marriage occurs without a Mahr , it is still valid, but the woman is still entitled to a Mahr like that of a woman of similar standing.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/224876/who-decides-mahr
