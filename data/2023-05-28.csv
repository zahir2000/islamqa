256427,"I have been confused about this issue for some time. I asked some people, but I am still not convinced. I understand that Allah has granted us and the jinn free will, and I actually feel that. But there are many hadiths in Bukhari which say that in reality, Allah has decreed whether a person will be pious or an evildoer, rich or poor, and so on. So everything is basically already decreed. Anas ibn Malik narrated that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah appoints an angel in the womb, who says, ‘O Lord, a nutfah (sperm-drop)? O Lord, an ‘alaqah (a clinging clot)? O Lord, a mudghah (lump of flesh)?’ When Allah decrees that it is to be created, (the angel) says, ‘O Lord, male or female? Doomed or blessed? What is his provision? What is his lifespan?’ And that is written in his mother’s womb.” Sahih al-Bukhari, hadith no. 6595. And in Surat an-Nahl, verse 93, Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {And if Allah had willed, He could have made you [of] one religion, but He causes to stray whom He wills and guides whom He wills. And you will surely be questioned about what you used to do}. The verses and hadiths mentioned above, and others, indicate that our deeds, both righteous and bad, are already decreed. I also know that we are constantly being tested, as Allah says in the opening verses of Surat al-‘Ankabut and elsewhere, whilst also having the freedom to choose to do righteous or evil deeds. But many verses and hadiths state that the Shaytan is responsible for misguiding us through his schemes and power, because he knows us inside out, but we do not know him at all.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe accountable individual has the ability and freedom to choose, whether he is a human or a jinni. Through this ability and free will he may believe or disbelieve, obey or disobey, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And say, “The truth is from your Lord, so whoever wills - let him believe; and whoever wills - let him disbelieve.” Indeed, We have prepared for the wrongdoers a fire whose walls will surround them}[al-Kahf 18:29].\nAnd He says:\n{Indeed, We created man from a sperm-drop mixture that We may try him; and We made him hearing and seeing.\nIndeed, We guided him to the way, be he grateful or be he ungrateful}[al-Insan 76:2-3].\nBecause the accountable individual is capable and has the freedom to choose, he will be requited for his deeds; if they are good then the outcome will be good, and if they are bad then the outcome will be bad, and your Lord is not ever unjust to His slaves.\n{So whoever does an atom’s weight of good will see it,\nAnd whoever does an atom’s weight of evil will see it}[az-Zalzalah 99:7-8].\nIf man had no free will and was forced to do what he does, then punishing him for these actions would be unjust, but Allah is far above being unjust.\nEvery person is aware that he has free will, so no one forces him to pray or go to the mosque, just as no one forces him to do haram deeds or go to places where such things are done.\nSecondly:\nBecause Allah, may He be exalted, is the Creator, it is no wonder that He knows His slave, what he is going to do and what his ultimate fate will be, whether he is blessed [destined for paradise] or doomed [destined for hell]. Allah, may He be glorified, knew that and wrote it with Him in al-Lawh al-Mahfuz, and He commands the angel to write that down when the foetus is still in his mother’s womb.\nBut this prior knowledge is hidden from man, and he is not aware of it. Allah does not force him to do anything or to refrain from anything. All the individual has to do is strive, and he will be requited for his efforts, like a student who is given a book to study and be tested on. If he works hard and strives he will succeed, but if he is heedless he will fail, even though his teacher already knows the expected outcome because he knows the student and is aware of his situation.\nThis is only an example, to make the matter easy to understand, and to Allah belong the most sublime attributes. Allah is the Creator of man and He knows the stealth of the eyes and all that the hearts conceal, and He has perfect knowledge of His slave, whom He created, and is aware of his situation. {How could He Who created not know His own creation, when He is the Knower of subtleties, the All-Aware?} [al-Mulk 67:14].\n\xa0As Allah, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{and Allah sends astray [thereby] whom He wills and guides whom He wills. And He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise}\xa0[Ibrahim 14:4]\n{And if Allah had willed, He could have made you [of] one religion, but He causes to stray whom He wills and guides whom He wills. And you will surely be questioned about what you used to do}\xa0[an-Nahl 16:93]\n{Whoever Allah guides - he is the [rightly] guided; and whoever He sends astray - it is those who are the losers}\xa0[al-A‘raf 7:178].\nAllah’s guidance is of two types, general and specific. As for the general type, that refers to guidance in the sense of showing the way and making the truth clear, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And as for Thamud, We guided them, but they preferred blindness over guidance, so the thunderbolt of humiliating punishment seized them for what they used to earn}\xa0[Fussilat 41:17]\n– that is, We showed them the path of truth.\nAnd Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Indeed, We guided him to the way, be he grateful or be he ungrateful}\xa0[al-Insan 76:2-3].\nAs for that which is specific, this guidance is for His believing slaves, meaning that He helps them to find and adhere to the path of guidance. For example, Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Those are the ones whom Allah has guided, so from their guidance take an example. Say, “I ask of you for this message no payment. It is not but a reminder for the worlds”}\xa0[al-An‘am 6:90]\n{And thus We have revealed to you an inspiration of Our command. You did not know what is the Book or [what is] faith, but We have made it a light by which We guide whom We will of Our servants. And indeed, [O Muhammad], you guide to a straight path}\xa0[ash-Shura 42:52]\n{And those who strive for Us - We will surely guide them to Our ways. And indeed, Allah is with the doers of good}\xa0[al-‘Ankabut 29:69]\n{But Allah has endeared to you the faith and has made it pleasing in your hearts and has made hateful to you disbelief, defiance and disobedience. Those are the [rightly] guided.\n[It is] as bounty from Allah and favor. And Allah is Knowing and Wise}\xa0[al-Hujurat 49:7-8].\nAs for misguidance, this refers to when Allah leaves a person to his own devices, and does not grant him the means of help and support.\nAt-Tahawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his famous book al-‘Aqidah: Allah guides whomever He wills, protecting him from sin and granting him well-being by His grace, and He leaves astray whomever He wills, forsaking him and putting him through trials by His justice. All of them are subject to His grace or justice, as He wills.\nGuidance, according to Ahl as-Sunnah wa’l-Jama‘ah, is when Allah grants a person His help and guidance, and makes things easy for him. Forsaking is when He leaves a person to his own devices, without any help or support.\nIt cannot be said: Why did He help this one and not that one?\nAllah’s help is based on His grace and His forsaking is based on His justice, and He, may He be glorified, {He cannot be questioned about what He does, but they will be questioned} [al-Anbiya’ 21:23].\nThat is not merely because He has might and control, but because He has perfect knowledge, power, mercy and wisdom. For He, may He be glorified and exalted, is the most just of those who judge and the most merciful of those who show mercy; He is more merciful towards His slaves than a mother towards her child, and He has perfected everything which He has created.""(Fatawa Shaykh al-Islam\xa0 79).\nAllah, may He be glorified, knows best who is deserving of grace and who is not, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{but Allah guides whom He wills. And He is most knowing of the [rightly] guided}\xa0[al-Qasas 28:56]\n{And thus We have tried some of them through others that the disbelievers might say, ""Is it these whom Allah has favored among us?"" Is not Allah most knowing of those who are grateful}\xa0[al-An‘am 6:53].\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said, explaining this important issue:\nIf it is said: If it is up to the will of Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, and all control is in His hand, then what power does man have, and what could he do if Allah has decreed that he is to be misguided and not guided?\nWe say: The answer to that is that Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, only guides those who deserve to be guided, and He leaves astray those who deserve to be left astray. Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And when they deviated, Allah caused their hearts to deviate}\xa0[as-Saff 61:5]\n{So for their breaking of the covenant We cursed them and made their hearts hard. They distort words from their [proper] usages and have forgotten a portion of that of which they were reminded}\xa0[al-Ma’idah 5:13].\nThus Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, has explained that the reason why He causes to go astray the who goes astray is only because of the person himself, and the person does not know what Allah, may He be exalted, has decreed for him, because he is unaware of the decree until after what was decreed has happened. Therefore he does not know what Allah has decreed for him, and whether he will be misguided or guided.\nWhy would he choose the path of misguidance, then argue that Allah, may He be exalted, wanted him to do that!\nIs it not more appropriate for him to choose the path of guidance, then say: Allah, may He be exalted, has guided me to the straight path.""(Risalah fi’l-Qada’ wa’l-Qadar, p.14).\nFor the rest of his words, please see the answer to question no. 220690 .\nThus we may conclude that:\n\nThe accountable person is free to choose whether to obey or disobey of his own free will, and he will be requited for that.\nAllah knows what His slave’s fate will be, and He has written that with Him.\nAllah supports and helps His believing slave, and He knows best who is deserving of support and help.\nAllah forsakes whomever He will, and does not grant him support or help him. His support is based on His grace and His forsaking is based on His justice.\nThe one who is helped is the one who asks Allah for support and help, because he cannot do without the grace of Allah for even the blink of an eye. Hence Allah, may He be exalted, says in Surat al-Fatihah: {It is You we worship and You we ask for help} [al-Fatihah 1:5]. So the religion is based on these two matters: worship and seeking help.\nThe believing slave affirms the grace of Allah, may He be exalted, acknowledges the blessings that He has bestowed upon him, and attributes all goodness and success to Him, as Allah tells us that the people of Paradise will say (interpretation of the meaning): { And We will have removed whatever is within their breasts of resentment, [while] flowing beneath them are rivers. And they will say, “Praise to Allah, who has guided us to this; and we would never have been guided if Allah had not guided us. Certainly the messengers of our Lord had come with the truth.” And they will be called, “This is Paradise, which you have been made to inherit for what you used to do”} [al-A‘raf 7:43].\n\nReflect on how this verse mentions together the grace and guidance of Allah, and the fact that paradise is earned through striving.\nIgnore these intrusive thoughts and focus on that which will benefit you, for this realm is the realm of striving and planting, and the hereafter is the realm of reward and harvesting. The people of Paradise will feel sad for wasting even a moment in which they did not remember Allah, so strive to attain virtues, do obligatory duties and compete for the highest levels in paradise. Ask Allah to accept your efforts, and to guide and help you.\nAs for the Shaytan, he tries to mislead people, but he has no power over the sincere slaves of Allah, as Allah, may He be exalted, tells us (interpretation of the meaning):\n{So when you recite the Qur’an, [first] seek refuge in Allah from Satan, the expelled [from His mercy].\nIndeed, there is for him no authority over those who have believed and rely upon their Lord.\nHis authority is only over those who take him as an ally and those who through him associate others with Allah }[an-Nahl 16:98-100].\nOn the Day of Resurrection, the Shaytan will disavow those who followed him and will tell them that he had no power over them; he only called them and they responded to him.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{ And Satan will say when the matter has been concluded, “Indeed, Allah had promised you the promise of truth. And I promised you, but I betrayed you. But I had no authority over you except that I invited you, and you responded to me. So do not blame me; but blame yourselves. I cannot be called to your aid, nor can you be called to my aid. Indeed, I deny your association of me [with Allah] before. Indeed, for the wrongdoers is a painful punishment”}[Ibrahim 14:22].\nWe ask Allah to help and guide us and you.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/256427/man-has-free-will-and-choice-and-allah-knows-whether-he-is-doomed-or-blessed
273675,"There is a juristic principle that was mentioned by the great scholar as-Sa‘di in his Manzumah, which states that the basic principle regarding meat is that it is prohibited. His student Ibn ‘Uthaymin commented on that by noting that this does not refer to live animals; rather the basic principle concerning live animals is that they are permissible. Rather this basic principle refers to meat, such as a game animal that fell into water or any slaughtered animal when the one who slaughtered it is unknown. The great scholar al-‘Alwan said something similar when he was refuting this principle, which was mentioned by the great scholar Ibn al-Qayyim, and he rejected it, but he affirmed something similar to the view of Ibn ‘Uthaymin, namely that if there is one reason to regard something as prohibited and another reason to regard it as permissible, then it is to be deemed prohibited. He mentioned the issue of a game animal if it falls into water, and he quoted as evidence to refute this principle the fact that the Sahabah ate the meat of tame donkeys before it was prohibited, when there was no specific evidence to suggest that it was permissible. He stated that there was no dispute among the Sahabah regarding the principle that the flesh of animals is permissible in general. As for the dispute, it arose among those who came after them. The jurists mentioned this principle. Could what is mentioned in their books be understood as meaning that it is general in application, in the sense that the basic principle regarding meat and animals is that they are prohibited? Some of the earlier jurists followed this principle and regarded it as general in application, and some of them put restrictions, as Ibn ‘Uthaymin mentioned that this is applicable to meat but not to the animals themselves.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe basic principle with regard to slaughtered animals and meats is that they are prohibited, so no slaughtered animal is permissible to eat unless we come to know that it was slaughtered in the manner prescribed in Islamic teachings.\nAmong the words of the scholars affirming this principle are the following:\n1.\xa0An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This highlights an important principle, which is that if there is any uncertainty that the animal was slaughtered in the proper manner which would make the meat of the animal permissible, then it is not permissible, because the basic principle is that it is prohibited. There is no dispute concerning this.""(Sharh Sahih Muslim\xa012/116).\n2.\xa0Ar-Rafi‘i (may Allah have mercy on him) said: In principle, meat is not permissible either. Do you not see that if a man slaughtered an animal that is about to die, and he was not sure whether its movement at the time of slaughter was the movement caused by slaughter or it was because it was still alive, in that case we give precedence to the ruling that it is prohibited.""(Fath al-‘Aziz Sharh al-Wajiz\xa01/280).\n3.\xa0Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The second type is that the original ruling is assumed to remain in effect unless there is evidence to the contrary and can be used as proof, such as assuming that the ruling of being in a state of purity is still in effect, or that the ruling of not being in a state of purity is still in effect, or assuming that marriage is still in effect, or assuming that someone is still the owner of something, or assuming that someone is still obliged to do religious duties, until there is evidence to the contrary. The Lawgiver has indicated that the ruling should be in accordance with the assumption when it was stated concerning the game animal: “If you find it drowned, then do not eat it, for you do not know whether it was killed by the water or by your arrow” and “If you find your [hunting] dog with another dog, do not eat [the game animal], for you only said Bismillah for your dog, and you did not say it for the other dog.” As the principle concerning slaughtered animals is that their meat is prohibited, if there is doubt as to whether the condition to make them permissible was met or not, then the game animal remains prohibited, in accordance with the general principle.""(I‘lam al-Muwaqqi‘in\xa0 1/339, 340).\nHe also said: As for the meat of slaughtered animals, it is prohibited except those which Allah and His Messenger have permitted. If it so happens that there are two reasons, one reason to say that it is prohibited and another to say that it is permissible, we should assume that it is prohibited. That is more appropriate, for three reasons:\n\nTo go along with the basic principle that it is prohibited.\nBecause that is more prudent.\nIf there are two contradictory reasons, they cancel one another out, so we must go back to the basic principle, which is that it is prohibited.""(Ahkam Ahl adh-Dhimmah\xa0 1/538, 539).\n\n4.\xa0Ibn Rajab al-Hanbali said: What is regarded in principle as being prohibited – such as sexual intercourse and the flesh of animals – does not become permissible except on the basis of certainty that it has become permissible through correct slaughter or the marriage contract. If there is any uncertainty regarding any of that, because there is cause for uncertainty, then we must go back to the original principle and base the ruling on it. So in the case of that which is regarded in principle as being prohibited, we deem it to be prohibited.\nHence the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade eating the game animal on which the hunter finds the mark of an arrow that is not his, or with which he finds a dog other than his dog, or he finds it after it has fallen into water, and he explained that the reason for that is that he does not know whether the animal died due to the cause which would make it permissible, or any other cause.""(Jami‘ al-‘Ulum wa’l-Hikam\xa0p. 93).\n5.\xa0Shaykh ‘Abd ar-Rahman as-Sa‘di\xa0 (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Manzumat al-Qawa‘id:\nThe basic principle regarding sexual intercourse and animal flesh, and lives and wealth that are protected by Islamic law is that they are prohibited unless there is a change which makes them permissible. So you should understand what I say, may Allah guide you.\nThen he (may Allah have mercy on him) said, explaining that:\nThat is, the general principle regarding these things is that they are prohibited, unless we are certain that a change has occurred which makes them permissible.\nThe basic principle regarding sexual intercourse is that it is prohibited. It is not permissible except when there is certainty that it has become permissible, either by means of a valid marriage contract or concubinage.\nThe same applies to animal flesh; the basic principle is that it is prohibited, except when there is certainty that it has become permissible.\nTherefore if two factors are found in an animal, one of which indicates that it has become permissible and the other indicates that it has become prohibited to eat it, the prohibition takes precedence, so the slaughtered animal or game animal is not permissible in that case.""(Al-Majmu‘ah al-Kamilah li Mu’allafat ash-Shaykh as-Sa‘di: al-Fiqh\xa0 1/142).\n6.\xa0Shaykh Muhammad ibn Salih al-‘Uthaymin said: The basic principle regarding the flesh of slaughtered animals is that it is prohibited, unless we know how it was slaughtered and whether it was slaughtered in the manner prescribed in Islamic teachings. That is because one of the conditions of it being permissible is that it should be slaughtered in the prescribed manner.""(Fatawa as-Sayd (p. 26-27), ed. ‘Abdullah at-Tayyar.\nSecondly:\nSome scholars may say that what the basic principle regarding animals – that they are prohibited – refers to is the flesh of slaughtered animals, and that it must be proven that the animal was slaughtered in the prescribed manner; it does not refer to the live animal.\nAn example of that is the words of al-Khattabi (may Allah have mercy on him): The animal in principle is prohibited, unless we are certain that it was slaughtered or hunted in the prescribed manner. Therefore it cannot become permissible if there is any doubt concerning that.""(Ma‘alim as-Sunan\xa0 4/282).\nAsh-Shatibi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The basic principle regarding sexual intercourse is that it is not allowed except by the prescribed means, and the basic principle regarding animals is that eating their meat is not allowed, unless they were slaughtered or hunted in the prescribed manner. And there are other similar issues that are prescribed in Islamic teachings.""(Al-Muwafaqat\xa0 1/401).\nThirdly:\nWith regard to live animals, the basic principle is that they are permissible, apart from those which are excluded, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{It is He who created for you all of that which is on the earth}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:29].\nThis indicates that the basic principle regarding things is that they are permissible – which includes animals, plants and other things – unless there is proof that they are prohibited, such as the prohibition on eating them, as it is prohibited to eat pigs and tame donkeys, and it is prohibited to eat any carnivore that has fangs or any bird that has talons; or it is prohibited to kill them, such as the prohibition on killing hoopoes and sparrowhawks; or there is a command to kill it, such as the command to kill snakes and rats; or it is proven to be harmful; or it is regarded as filthy, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{he makes good things lawful to them and bad things unlawful}\xa0[al-A‘raf 7:157].\nIn al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (18/336) it says:\nWhat is permissible to eat of animals is difficult to list. The basic principle is that they are all permissible in general, apart from those which are excluded below:\n\nPigs. They are prohibited according to the texts of the Qur’an and Sunnah, and scholarly consensus.\n\nThe scholars differed regarding other animals. The majority of jurists are of the view that it is not permissible to eat any carnivore that has fangs, such as lions, tigers, leopards, wolves, dogs and so on, or any bird that has talons, such as kestrels, falcons, vultures, eagles, gyrfalcons and so on, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade every carnivore that has fangs and every bird that has talons.\nThen the scholars differed as to whether some particular animals are permissible or prohibited, such as horses, hyenas, foxes, all types of crows, and so on. For more detail, please see the topic “Foods.”\nOne of the views of the Maliki madhhab is that all animals may be eaten, from elephants to ants and worms, and so on, except humans and pigs, which are prohibited according to scholarly consensus.\nSimilarly, in their view – according to one report – no kinds of birds are prohibited. This was the view of al-Layth, al-Awza‘i and Yahya ibn Sa‘id. They quoted as evidence the general meaning of the verses which permit eating animals, and the view of Abu’d-Darda’ and Ibn ‘Abbaas, which is that what Allah did not mention is pardoned.\n\nThat which we are commanded to kill,\n\nsuch as snakes, scorpions and rats, and all harmful carnivores such as lions and wolves, and other creatures mentioned above.\n\nThings that are regarded as filthy.\n\nOne of the guidelines on what is permissible and what is prohibited is that we should pay attention to what is regarded as good and wholesome, and what is regarded as bad and filthy. Ash-Shafa‘i (may Allah have mercy on him) thought that this was the greatest and most comprehensive of guidelines. The basic principle regarding that is the verses in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{he makes good things lawful to them and bad things unlawful}\xa0[al-A‘raf 7:157]\n{They ask you, [O Muhammad], what has been made lawful for them. Say, ""Lawful for you are [all] good foods…}\xa0[al-Ma’idah 5:4].\nSee: al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (5/132-147), in which there is a detailed discussion about land animals, which are of thirteen types, as well as the difference of scholarly opinion concerning them.\nConclusion:\nThe differentiation between live animals and the flesh of animals or slaughtered animals, is something that is well known and is clear. The basic principle regarding live animals is that they are permissible, in contrast to the flesh of animals or slaughtered animals, regarding which the basic principle is that they are prohibited.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Is the basic principle regarding the flesh of animals that it is permissible or prohibited?\nHe replied: The basic principle regarding the flesh of animals is that it is prohibited, not that animals are prohibited. The basic principle regarding live animals is that they are permissible, and the basic principle regarding the flesh of animals is that it is prohibited unless we know or think it most likely that they are permissible.\nWhat this means is: if we are uncertain as to whether this animal is permissible or prohibited, then it is permissible, and if we slaughter it in the prescribed manner we may eat it. But if we are uncertain as to whether this meat was slaughtered in the prescribed manner or died of other causes, then the basic principle is that it is prohibited, unless we think it most likely that it is halal and permissible…""(Liqa’ al-Bab al-Maftuh\xa0 234/9).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/273675/the-basic-principle-regarding-animals-is-that-they-are-permissible-but-in-the-case-of-slaughtered-animals-and-their-meat-the-basic-principle-is-that-they-are-prohibited
