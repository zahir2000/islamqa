109859,"A man rented his wife’s house for seventy thousand dirhams, to be paid by his work, and twenty-four thousand dirhams will be deducted from his salary. The question is: is the money that his wife will receive subject to zakah? Please note that the husband and wife are living in this house.","['Praise be to Allah.Yes, zakah must be given on the rent that the wife receives, if one full year has passed. The year is to be counted from the time when the rental contract is drawn up, and at the end of that year she must give zakah on it or on what remains of it, if it reaches the minimum threshold (nisab), at a rate of 2.5%. If she has spent it all and has not saved anything of it, then no zakah is due on it.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin was asked, as it says in Majmu‘ al-Fatawa (18/question no. 110):\nWhat is the ruling on zakah on money that a person receives for apartments that he rents out, as he does not receive the rent for one apartment all in one go; rather he receives it in two or three payments?\nHe replied:\nAll the rent that a person receives little by little, if he spends it when he receives it, no zakah is due on it, so long as one year has not passed since the rental contract was drawn up.\nOne example of that is a man who rents out an apartment for ten thousand, and at the end of the year he receives ten thousand. In this case he must give zakah on it, because one year has passed since the contract was drawn up.\nAnother man received the rent in full in advance – meaning that the landlord received it at the time of drawing up the contract, then he spent it. In this case no zakah is due on it, because one full year did not pass since it was received, and one of the conditions of zakah being obligatory is that one full year should have passed.\nAs for the apartment itself, it is not subject to zakah, because anything that is prepared for rental is not subject to zakah, such as real estate, cars,\xa0 equipment and so on, except jewellery made of gold or silver, which is subject to zakah every year in all cases if it reaches the minimum threshold (nisab).

276,"In a discussion among Muslims, we were trying to arrive at a definition of ""love"" in Islam. Though we are all well aware of the love of Allah and our obligation to love both Him and His Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him), we wondered if there is a clear outline of love between humans (similar to the Christian ""brotherly love""...NOT the romantic variety). Some posited that ""love"" lies only within the family, all else is but respect/friend- ship/etc. Others questioned whether love is limited to spouses and/or children. Still others questioned if love can be conditional or not. One idea is that ""love"" (as the term is commonly used) may even be an 'innovation' of sorts, based on fairy tales and Christian philosophy. Many of us have looked in various sources to seek out an ""answer"", but no one has found a definitive answer as of yet... Can you help?","[""Praise be to Allah.Types of love in Islam\nI was very happy to hear that you and your fellow Muslim sisters are studying Islamic issues and trying to find out about Islamic views of love. No doubt, you and your sisters understand the importance of the scholars’ views and referring to them in matters of dispute. I will quote here a number of views about love, so that you will understand the matter better, in sha Allah\nLove in Islam may be divided into specific love and general love.\nTypes of specific love\nSpecific love may be divided into types that are permissible and types that are prohibited.\n\nPermissible love:\n\n\nLove of Allah : This is the most important obligation, as it is the basis of Islam. By perfecting one’s love of Allah, one perfects their faith. If one’s love of Allah is lacking, then one’s Tawhid is also lacking. The evidence for this is the verses (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n“But those who believe, love Allah more (than anything else)” [Al-Baqarah 2:165]\n“Say: If your fathers, your sons, your brothers, your wives, your kindred, the wealth that you have gained, the commerce in which you fear a decline, and the dwellings in which you delight are dearer to you than Allah and His Messenger, and striving hard and fighting in His cause, then wait until Allah brings about His Decision (torment). And Allah guides not the people who are Fasiqun (rebellious, disobedient).” [Al-Tawbah 9:24]\nThere are also other similar proofs in the Quran and Sunnah.\nThe love of Allah may also take the form of preferring what Allah loves and wants of His slave over what the slave himself might love and want. So he loves what Allah loves, hates what He hates, takes as friends or regards as enemies for His sake, and adheres to His laws. There are many ways to strengthen this type of love.\n\nLove of Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him): This is also one of the most important duties of Islam. Indeed, faith is not complete until a person loves the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) more than he loves himself, as in the Hadiths:\n\nThe Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: “None of you truly believes until I am more beloved to him than his child, his father and all the people.” (Reported by Muslim, no. 44)\n‘Abdullah ibn Hisham (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “We were with the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him), and he was holding the hand of ‘Umar ibn Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him); ‘Umar said to him: O Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him), you are dearer to me than everything except my own self. The Prophet (peace be and blessings upon him) said: No (that is not right), by the One in Whose Hand is my soul, (not) until I am dearer to you than your own self. ‘Umar said to him, now, by Allah, you are dearer to me than my own self. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: Now (you are right), O Umar.” (Reported by Al-Bukhari, no. 6632).\nThis love is part of loving Allah and is manifested by following the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) and giving precedence to his opinion over that of others.\n\nLove of the Prophets and the believers: This is obligatory because loving Allah dictates that one should love the people who obey Him, namely, the Prophets and righteous people. The evidence for this is the Hadith: “Whoever loves for the sake of Allah (i.e., loves the people of faith for the sake of Allah ) … has perfected faith”\xa0\n\nObedience to Allah is based on the love of Allah. Faith cannot be perfected except in this way, even if one has a lot of prayers and fasting to their credit. ‘Umar ibn Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I have witnessed at the time of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him), none of us would think that he had more right to his own money than his Muslim brother.”\n\nForbidden love :\n\n\nThis includes love that constitutes Shirk (ascribing rivals to\xa0 Allah), which is when a person loves something instead of Allah or as much as Him. In such a case he has taken that thing as a rival to Allah. This is the Shirk of love, and most people have taken things as rivals to Allah in love and glorification.\nThere are also types of forbidden love which do not go to the extent of Shirk, such as loving one's family, wealth, tribe, business or house, and preferring those things, in whole or in part, over doing the duties that Allah requires of him, such as Hijrah (migration for His sake), Jihad, etc. The evidence for this is the verse quoted above “Say: If your fathers, your sons, your brothers, your wives, your kindred, the wealth that you have gained, the commerce in which you fear a decline, and the dwellings in which you delight . . . are dearer to you than Allah and His Messenger, and striving hard and fighting in His cause, then wait until Allah brings about His Decision (torment).” [Al-Tawbah 9:24])\n\nTypes of general love\nGeneral love is of three types:\n\nNatural love, such as the love of a hungry person for food, or a thirsty person for water. This does not involve any kind of glorification, so it is permissible.\nLove based on mercy and pity, such as the love of a father for his small child. This also involves no kind of glorification, so there is nothing wrong with it.\nLove based on acquaintance and friendship, such as that between those who share a common profession, or scholars in the same field, or people one meets on a daily basis (such as fellow-commuters), or people one does business with, or travelling-companions. This type of appropriate love between people or between fellow Muslim brothers does not imply Shirk or associating anyone else in one's love for Allah.\n\nFor more information, please see Kitab Taysir al-Aziz, Bab wa min al-nas man yattakhidhu min dun-Allahi andadan.\nWe hope that this explanation makes the matter clearer.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/276/types-of-love-and-their-ruling
311585,I had been married to my husband for two years and we have one child together. I am now 4 months pregnant and about 2 months ago I was granted a Khulah. Now me and my ex regret this choice and I feel as though I could have been more patient with him in our marriage. do I have to wait until I give birth and clean from my bleeding before I can remarry him or can I do it while I am pregnant,"['Praise be to Allah.Khul‘ means that the wife is completely divorced from the husband in the sense of minor divorce, and she is not permissible for the one who divorced her by khul‘ except with a new marriage contract.\nWhat is required of the woman who has been divorced by khul‘ is to observe ‘iddah for one menstrual cycle, according to the correct scholarly view, unless she is pregnant, in which case her ‘iddah ends when she gives birth.\nIt is permissible for her former husband to do a new marriage contract with her and consummate the marriage with her during her ‘iddah; what is prohibited is for someone else to marry her during her ‘iddah.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If a man divorces his wife by khul‘ or annuls the marriage, he may remarry her during her ‘iddah according to the view of the majority of jurists. This is the view of Sa‘id ibn al-Musayyab, ‘Ata’, Tawus, az-Zuhri, al-Hasan, Qatadah, Malik, ash-Shafa‘i and ashab ar-ra’y.\nSome of the later scholars had an odd view and said: it is not permissible for him to marry her or propose to her, because she is observing ‘iddah.\nOur view is that the purpose of the ‘iddah is to preserve his lineage and protect his semen [from being mixed with that of another man, if she were to marry someone else during her ‘iddah] and there is no point in protecting his own semen from his semen, if their initial marriage was valid.""(Al-Mughni\xa0 8/127).\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his Tafsir (1/620): All scholars are agreed that the one who divorced his wife by khul‘ may remarry her during her ‘iddah. Shaykh Abu ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-Barr narrated from a group that it is not permissible for him to do that, just as it is not permissible for anyone else, but this is an odd view and is to be rejected.

5511,Is it obligatory for men to get married?,"['Praise be to Allah.The ruling on marriage for men differs according to their situations and circumstances. Marriage is obligatory on the man who is (financially and physically) able to marry and longs to get married, and fears “hardship” otherwise, because it is obligatory for him to protect himself from committing forbidden deeds and to keep himself chaste – and this can only be achieved through marriage.\nAl-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“If a person is able to marry and fears that he may be harmed or his religious commitment may be adversely affected if he remains single, the only way to prevent this harm is through marriage, and there is no difference of opinion among the scholars – they agree that marriage is obligatory on such a person.\nAl-Mardawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his book Al-Insaf: Part Three: the one who fears “hardship”. In the case of such a person, marriage is obligatory, and this is the unanimous opinion of the scholars… “Hardship” here means zina (fornication), according to the correct opinion. Or it was said that it means being doomed by committing zina … What is meant by “Unless he fears that he may fall into committing forbidden actions” means, if he knows or thinks that he will do that. In Al-Furu’ it says: (marriage) becomes obligatory only when he is sure that he will do that.” (Al-Insaf, part 8; Kitab Al-Nikah, Ahkam Al-Nikah)\nIf he wants to get married but is unable to spend on a wife, then he should adhere to the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And let those who find not the financial means for marriage keep themselves chaste, until Allah enriches them of His Bounty.” [Al-Nur 24:33]\nSo he should fast a lot, because of the Hadith narrated from Ibn Mas’ud who said that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “O young people, whoever among you can afford to get married, let him do so, for it helps one to lower the gaze and protect the private parts (i.e., remain chaste). Whoever cannot afford it, let him fast, for it is a protection for him.”\n‘Umar said to Abu’l-Zawaid: “Nothing is stopping you from getting married except incapacity or immorality.” (See Fiqh Al-Sunnah, 2/15-17)\nMarriage is obligatory on anyone who is single and committing sins such as looking (at women) or kissing. If a man or a woman knows or thinks it most likely that if he does not get married he will commit zina – or whatever comes under the same rulings or is similar to it, such as masturbation , then marriage is obligatory.\xa0\nIt is still obligatory even if a person knows that he will still sin after marriage, because once he is married he will be less likely to sin, because he will be distracted from it at least part of the time, whereas if he remains single he will sin all the time.\nAnyone who looks at the state of things in our times, how there is so much immorality and so much temptation, will be convinced that the obligation to marry is even more important now than at any time in the past. We ask Allah to purify our hearts, keep us away from haram things and help us to be chaste.\xa0\nFor more, please see this category: Ruling on Marriage.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/5511/is-it-compulsory-for-men-to-get-married
