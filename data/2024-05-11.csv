327313,recently the Bank is asking for the house.,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIf you wish to keep the house, there is no harm in retaining it even with the payment of usurious interest to the bank. As you clarified in your first question, you purchased it through a mortgage, and we answered that you must repent from usury, and there is no harm in staying in the house.\nThe principle is that whoever buys something with a usurious loan, they own it along with the sin of usury, and if a person cannot avoid paying the usurious interest: it is permissible for them to pay it, along with repentance from the original prohibited transaction.\nSecondly:\nIf you do not wish to keep the house, and you do not have the money to pay off what you owe after the bank sells the house at a loss, it is permissible for you to approach the National Debt Assistance Center to take on the debt for you, and you pay them in installments, provided that they do not take any extra amount over what they will pay to the bank, otherwise, this is prohibited usury, and you must then keep the house and pay the bank to avoid entering into a new usurious transaction.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/327313/resorting-to-the-national-debt-assistance-center-on-defaulted-mortgage
81994,"There is a man who is religiously committed and regularly offers Nafl prayers, and he fears Allah as much as he can. But since he was small he has had the sickness of fulfilling his desire by imitating women and wearing their clothes. Is there any sin on him?","['Praise be to Allah.Ruling on men imitating women\nIslam forbids men to imitate women and women to imitate men , and in fact it emphatically forbids that, to such an extent that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed those who go against the human nature with which Allah created them.\xa0\nIt was narrated from Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed men who imitate women and women who imitate men, and he said: “Throw them out of your houses.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 5885)\xa0\nUndoubtedly one of the most obvious signs of an effeminate man is that he wears women’s clothing and imitates their ways.\xa0\nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed the man who wears women’s clothing and the woman who wears men’s clothing. (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 4098 and classed as authentic by An-Nawawi in Al-Majmu`, 4/469 and by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud)\xa0\n`Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed masculinized women. “Narrated by Abu Dawud, 4099; classed as good by An-Nawawi in Al-Majmu`, 4/469 and as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud)\xa0\nAl-Munawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \xa0\n“As An-Nawawi said, this indicates that it is prohibited for men to imitate women and vice versa, because if it is prohibited with regard to clothing then imitating them in one’s movements and tone of voice is even more abhorrent. So it is prohibited for men to imitate women and vice versa with regard to clothing that is unique to one’s sex, and the one who does that is subject to the threat of being cursed.” (Fayd Al-Qadir, 5/343)\xa0\nOnce this is established, we will know that the Islamic ruling on this kind of sexual perversion is that it is prohibited, and it is a major sin. So it is not permissible to do that whether alone or with one’s wife, because going against the sound human nature (Fitrah) that Allah has created in us can only result in corruption and evil. Allah has created man with masculine qualities that cannot go with wearing women’s clothing or imitating women’s mannerisms.\xa0\nUndoubtedly the one who seeks to be effeminate and derives pleasure from that and thinks that it fulfils his desire is sick with a disease that the doctors describe as a “fetish”. They have behavioural programs to treat such cases that are presented to them, so anyone who is faced with this problem should not hesitate to go to a psychologist to supervise his treatment for this sickness.\xa0\nRemedy to issue of men imitating women\nAll we can do is remind him of Allah and make his religious commitment a positive and effective factor in ridding him of this Waswas . He should remember the wrath of Allah towards effeminate men, and he should remember that He can see everything they do, and that this life is a few short days that will quickly cease to be, and a man will be left with his deeds in the Hereafter.\xa0\nWe remind him to seek the help of Allah, for He is the best of helpers and the best One to ask for help. If a person is sincere in his du’a’ and seeking help and turning to Him, Allah will answer his prayer and relieve him of his problem. But part of praying sincerely is sincerely applying the means and striving hard and being patient until full healing comes and he gives up these evil haram practices. And for his efforts and patience he will be rewarded by Allah, may He be glorified and exalted.\xa0\nThe best thing that will help him to give up this inclination is marriage, because it opens the door to satisfying sexual desires in good and permissible ways. Whilst he is waiting for that, he should distract himself from desires by filling his time with acts of worship and beneficial habits, and he should try to fast, because it is very helpful in controlling desires. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said concerning it: “Whoever cannot afford (to get married) should fast, for it will diminish his desire.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 1905 and Muslim, 1400)\xa0\nOne of the most important things that will help him is: respecting the sacred limits set by Allah, by refraining from looking at people’s `Awrahs and refraining from thinking of desires, because looking at prohibited things is the basis of every calamity, and that is what leads one to these bad, perverted habits that he sees among some perverts. \xa0\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \xa0\n“Looking generates thoughts, then thoughts generate ideas, then ideas generate desire, then desires generate will, then the will grows strong and resolves to do the deed, and then the deed will inevitably take place unless there is something to prevent it. Concerning this it was said that patience in lowering the gaze is easier than patience in bearing the pain that comes afterwards.” (Al-Jawab Al-Kafi, p. 106)\xa0\nIt should be noted that thinking about such perversions will inevitably lead to doing them, so it is essential to divert oneself from such thinking, and to distract oneself with permissible kinds of pleasure with one’s wife. He should not try to connect fulfilment of desire with those bad practices. That is the whispers of the Shaytan.\nUndoubtedly the best kind of pleasure is that which is achieved in accordance with the sound human nature with which Allah has created people.\xa0\nWe ask Allah to guide you to the straight path.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/81994/ruling-on-men-imitating-women
365477,"Some people analyze the Qurans language in an interesting way. For example, they say that some parts of verses are palindromes (can be read forwards and backward the same way) and they link this to the meaning of the verse. Or they claim that in the phrase ""kun fayakun"" the k is a ""cutting sound"" and the n is a ""vivid sound"" and so the transition from k (cut) to n (vivid) in""kun"" symbolizes something coming into existence, which is linked to the meaning of the phrase ""kun fayakun"".","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe Noble Quran is a sign from Allah, the Exalted and Praised, and Allah has placed within it many signs of truth. Among the signs of its truthfulness and proofs that it is from Allah, the Exalted, are the unique phonetic properties not found in any other text. Indeed, the Quran contains phonetic styles that are unmatched elsewhere.\nDr. Muhammad Daraz says, ""Let the proficient reciter read the Quran; recite it properly, descending upon the inclination of the Quran, and not imposing his own inclinations upon it. Then distance yourself from him to a remote place where you do not hear the ringing of its letters, but you hear its movements and stillness, its elongations and melodies, its connections and pauses, then lend your ear to this phonetic collection, made exclusive and released plainly into the air. You will find yourself facing a strange and wonderful melody; you will not find it in any other speech even if it were rendered exclusive and refined in this manner.\nYou will find a harmony and unity that captivates your hearing as music and poetry do, yet it is not the tunes of music, nor the patterns of rhythm of poetry, and you will find something else that you do not find in music or poetry. That is because you listen to a poem and find its rhythm unified line by line, and part by part, and you listen to a piece of music and find its moods similar and going in a close direction; so your hearing soon rejects it, and your nature tires of it, if it is repeated and recited to you with one signature.\nWhereas with the Quran, you are always in a varied and renewed melody, moving between causes and pegs and pauses in different positions, each string of your heart\'s chords taking an equal share, so that no matter how often it is repeated, it does not bring you boredom or weariness, but you constantly seek more of it,"" End quote.\n""An-Naba\' Al-Adhim"" (p. 133 - 134).\nHe also mentioned the beauty of the articulation points of the letters, saying, ""If you bring your ear a little closer, the jewels of its letters coming out from their correct articulation points will strike your hearing, surprising you with another pleasure in the arrangement of those letters and their lining up, and the ordering of their positions among themselves; this one taps and that one whistles, a third whispers and a fourth declares loudly, another lets the breath slide over it, and another holds the breath. And so on, you see the linguistic beauty manifest before you in a different yet harmonious collection, without rattling or babbling, without softness or harshness, without discord or repulsion.\nThus, you see speech that is neither the bland urban nor the rough Bedouin, but you see it having blended within it the robustness and grandeur of the desert with the delicacy and fluidity of the city, and the matter is measured in such a way that neither exceeds the other. It is as if it is the essence of the two languages, and their progeny, or as if it is the point of contact between the tribes, where their tastes meet, and upon it their hearts agree,"" End quote.\n""An-Naba\' Al-Adhim"" (p. 135).\nSecondly:\nThere is a correlation between the parts of the Noble Quran, which scholars refer to as the coherence between the verses and Surahs. This coherence may be between one Surah and another, between the beginning of a Surah and the one following it, between the verses of a single Surah, and between the beginning and end of a Surah.\n""And there is not a Surah except that it has its own (landmarks) that distinguish it, whether they are short or long Surahs, and the shorter the Surahs, the greater this characteristic becomes. This is clear from the fact that Allah, the Exalted, did not make the short Surahs a single independent Surah except for a great wisdom, which is the independence of each one of them with what distinguishes it from others.""\nSee: ""Misbah Ad-Durar fi Tanasub Ayat Al-Quran Al-Karim wa As-Suwar"" (p. 93).\nThere is also a close proximity between the topics of the Surahs and their objectives, as each Surah of the Quran has a purpose and goal, that is, a significance to which the meanings of the Surah and its content return, and represents its spirit that flows through all its parts.\nThe objective may be the same as the topic of the Surah, or the objective may differ from the topic, in that a single Surah may have a number of topics, and these topics return to one objective.\nKnowing the topics of the Surah and its objective is one of the most important aids to contemplating the Surah and realizing its miraculous nature, because you find that despite the different topics of the Surah, it leads to one goal in a harmony that compels the observer to deem it impossible for this speech to be of human origin.\nThe search for the topics of the Surah and its objective requires certain matters:\nThe most important of which are: understanding the meanings of the Surah, realizing the appropriateness between the verses, and realizing the appropriateness between the Surah and what precedes and follows it. All this makes the reader of the Quran more attentive to what he recites and more present in understanding it.\nAmong the important books in this field are:\n1- Asma\' Suwar Al-Quran wa Fada\'iliha, Dr. Munirah Al-Dosari, Dar Ibn Al-Jawzi, it is an important book in its field.\n2- An-Naba\' Al-Adhim, Dr. Muhammad Daraz, Tafakkur Center.\n3- Muhtawayah Suwar Al-Quran Al-Karim, Sheikh Ahmad Al-Taweel, Dar Al-Watan.\n4- Dalail An-Nizam, by the teacher Abdul Hamid Al-Farahi.\n5- Al-Burhan fi Tanasub Surah Al-Quran, by Imam Ibn Zubair Al-Gharnati, Dar Ibn Al-Jawzi.\n6- At-Tanasub bayna As-Suwar fi Al-Muftatah wa Al-Khawatim, Dr. Fadil Al-Samarrai, Dar Ibn Kathir.\nAnd among the Tafsirs that have taken care of highlighting these aspects are:\n1- Nazm Al-Durar fi Tanasub Al-Ayat wa As-Suwar, by Imam Al-Biqa`i.\n2- At-Tahrir wa At-Tanwir, by Imam Al-Tahir Ibn Ashur.\n3- Masu`at At-Tafsir Al-Mawdu`i, University of Sharjah.\nAnd see: ""Ad-Dalil ila Al-Quran,"" Amr Al-Sharqawi (p. 78).\nThirdly:\nWe have not been able to personally examine the details of the attempts mentioned in the question, nor have we seen anything of them.\nHowever, we mention here some general methodological alerts, which we summarize as follows:\n1- One should not force oneself to research the characteristics of letters and their connection to the word and then the position of this word in the sentence, because this may obscure the main purpose of the Quran, which is to be a book of guidance.\n2- It must be known that this is merely one of the delicacies of the Quran, and its seasoning, and not from the solid knowledge, nor from the general objectives of the Noble Quran, nor the central meanings it brought; rather, it is closer to being, if correct, from the superficial layer as the scholar (Daraz) expresses.\n3- Writing in such a field, and the possibility of contributing one\'s own insights, requires special knowledge and tools; the most important of which are specialization in phonetic studies and related sciences, then proficiency in the sciences of Arabic morphology and rhetoric; and such is not attainable by everyone, so the matter should be put in its proper place, and one should not undertake what one has no knowledge of, nor should one pretend to be an expert in a field for which the tools of research and examination are not complete, even if one\'s tools of research and examination were complete.\n4- If something of this is established for a person, there is no harm in speaking of it, but as his own ijtihad, which should be presented to the solid knowledge, its essence, and its core; and one should not exaggerate in this so that it is said to be from the ""miraculous nature,"" lest the Word of Allah and its miraculous nature be exposed to speculation and debate, as has happened with those concerned with examining aspects of the ""scientific miracles"" of the Noble Quran; and indeed, both extremes in intending matters are reprehensible!!\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/365477/miraculous-language-of-the-quran
12567,"Why is playing cards – I mean only playing, without gambling – counted as haram? We are not playing for money.","['Praise be to Allah.Is playing cards prohibited in Islam?\nThe Standing Committee was asked about playing cards if that does not distract people from prayer and there is no money involved. They answered:\xa0\n“Playing cards is not permitted , even if there is no money involved, because the problem with that is that it distracts people from remembering Allah (Dhikr) and from prayer. Even if they claim that this is not the case, then it is still a means that may lead to gambling which is expressly forbidden in the Quran . Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Intoxicants (all kinds of alcoholic drinks), and gambling, and Al-Ansab (stone altars for sacrifices to false gods) and Al-Azlam (arrows for seeking luck or decision) are an abomination of Shaytan’s (Satan’s) handiwork. So avoid (strictly all) that (abomination) in order that you may be successful.” [Al-Ma’idah 5:90]\nThese cards have an effect on society, for the bonds of a strong society are achieved by means of two things: following the commands of Allah and heeding His prohibitions. A society disintegrates when it neglects any of those duties or does any of those things that are forbidden. These cards form one of the factors which have an effect on society. They cause people to neglect prayer in congregation, and they generate alienation, breaking of ties, hatred and negligence through the committing of haram actions, and they make people too lazy to earn a living.” (Fatawa Islamiyyah, 4/436)\nHistory of playing cards\nWith regard to the history of these playing cards: No one really knows who invented playing cards or when or where they were invented. It has been said that they are of Chinese or Indian origin, or otherwise. But historians agree that they came to Europe from the Middle East in the latter part of the Middle Ages. Experts also say that there is agreement that playing cards have clearly evolved from that time until now.\xa0\nPlaying cards made their first appearance in Europe in Andalusia, and were brought to northern Spain in the eleventh century CE.\xa0\nThe traditional deck of cards in Spain consisted of 40 cards, including the numbers 1 to 7, plus three characters, the highest of which was the “ruler”, followed by the “deputy”, then the “scribe” or “knight.”\xa0\nIn the sixteenth century, the French changed the cards, replacing the “ruler” with the king, the “deputy” with the queen, and the “knight” with the jack. They also added three new numbers, so that the deck now consisted of 52 cards. In the seventeenth century, the Germans added a fourth character, the joker.\xa0\nWe have quoted above the fatwa on playing with these cards. It may also be added that playing cards is devoid of any of the goals of recreational activities as required in Islam; it does not teach any skill that is needed for Jihad or any useful knowledge or bring any social benefit or relaxation that will calm the nerves. Rather it is a game that has nothing good in it; it causes arguments and simply kills time. It is based on speculation and chance, and it is like playing with dice, in that it leads to disputes and fighting, and it is like alcohol and gambling.\xa0\nBased on the above, it would not be farfetched to suggest that it is prohibited rather than disliked, by analogy with dice, because both are based on chance and both lead to arguments.\xa0\nThe same view was favoured by Shaykh Ibn Hajar Al-Haythami (may Allah have mercy on him), and it is the view of our contemporary scholars, and of Shaykh Muhammad ibn Salih Al-`Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) among the jurists of Al-Najd, who transmitted it from his shaykhs. This is based on the fact that it leads to enmity and hatred, and because it is a great waste of time and it distracts people from remembering Allah (Dhikr) and keeps them from worshipping and obeying Him.\xa0\nThis view is further supported by the fact that one of the French kings issued orders banning people from playing cards during the day, and stating that everyone who went against this order was to be arrested and punished. That was because the French people loved playing cards too much, to such an extent that they were neglecting their work in order to play cards. The punishment dictated by this French king was not just a brief imprisonment, he also added a severe beating as a deterrent to others.\xa0\nYet despite these decrees and others, he did not succeed in uprooting the habit of playing cards; the only result was that the people started to play in secret rather than openly.\xa0(From Qadaya Al-Lahw wat Tarfih by Madun Rashid, p. 185-187)\nFor more details, please refer to the following answers: 120806 , 335520 , 95409 , and 181642 .\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12567/is-playing-cards-prohibited
