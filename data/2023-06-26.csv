409850,"In the hadith of ‘A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), she said to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): O Messenger of Allah, do women have to do jihad? He said: “Yes, they have to do a jihad in which there is no fighting: Hajj and ‘umrah.” If a woman’s jihad is Hajj, does this mean that if a woman dies during her Hajj she is a martyr who died in Allah’s cause?","['Praise be to Allah.It is proven that Hajj is the jihad of women.\nAl-Bukhari (1520) narrated from ‘Aishah, the Mother of the Believers (may Allah be pleased with her), that she said: O Messenger of Allah, we see that jihad is the best of deeds; shouldn’t we (women) engage in jihad? He said: “No, but the best of jihad is an accepted Hajj.”\nIbn Majah (2901) narrated that ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: O Messenger of Allah, is jihad obligatory for women? He said: “Yes, they have to do a jihad in which there is no fighting: Hajj and ‘Umrah.”\nIt is not mentioned in the hadith that if a woman dies [during Hajj] she will attain the reward of martyrdom, for the reward of jihad does not necessarily imply the reward of martyrdom. But if the woman hopes for the status of martyrdom and seeks to attain it, and wants to do Hajj because it is the jihad that she is able to do, then in this case if she dies, there is the hope that she will attain the reward of martyrdom, because of her intention, not because merely dying during Hajj means that one has automatically attained martyrdom. That is because of the general meaning of the hadith narrated by Sahl ibn Abi Umamah ibn Sahl ibn Hunayf, from his father, from his grandfather, that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever sincerely asks Allah for martyrdom, Allah will cause him to attain the status of the martyrs, even if he dies in his bed.” Narrated by Muslim (1909).\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWith regard to the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), “Whoever sincerely seeks martyrdom will be granted it, even if he does not die as a martyr”\xa0 – And according to another report, “Whoever sincerely asks Allah for martyrdom, Allah will cause him to attain the status of the martyrs, even if he dies in his bed” – what is meant by the former report is explained by the latter. When taken together, what they mean is that if he sincerely asks for martyrdom, he will be granted some of the reward of the martyrs, even if he dies in his bed. This indicates that it is recommended to ask for martyrdom and to always aspire for what is good.

109347,"When slaughtering the sacrifice, the blood got onto the ihram garments. Is it permissible to wear them, and does the pilgrim have to offer a compensatory sacrifice in this case?","['Praise be to Allah.If the blood is pure (tahir), it does not matter if it gets on to one’s ihram garments or other clothes. Pure (tahir) blood of an animal is that which remains in the flesh and veins after it is slaughtered, such as blood in the heart, legs and so on. But if the blood is impure (najis), it must be washed off, whether it got onto ihram garments or anything else. This refers to the blood that is poured forth. So if someone slaughtered a sheep, for example, and some of its blood gets onto him, then he must wash off the blood that got onto him, regardless of whether it got onto his clothes or his ihram garments or his body. However, the scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) said that a small amount of blood is overlooked, because it is difficult to avoid it.
