20017,"If I want to travel by plane and the time of take-off is before `Asr begins, and the take-off of the second flight is immediately after the first plane lands, is it permissible to combine `Asr with Zuhr and shorten them in my home city? What is the ruling if I do that? What is the correct thing to do?","[""Praise be to Allah.It is permissible for the person who is not travelling to combine two prayers if it will be too difficult for him to perform the second prayer on time. Permission to join prayers is broader than permission to shorten them, because shortening them is allowed only to travelers , but both travelers and non-travellers are permitted to join prayers when it will be difficult to perform the second prayer, whether on time or in congregation.\nBased on this, it is permissible for you to bring `Asr forward and pray it with Zuhr in your home city, if you think it most likely that you will not be able to pray it on time because of travelling.\xa0\nIf the airport is outside your city, you can pray in the airport and shorten your prayers. If you live near the airport, then you can join the prayers but you cannot shorten them .\xa0\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymهn (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\nQuestion:\xa0\nIf a person is in Qasهm and goes out to the airport, can he shorten his prayers in the airport?\xa0\nAnswer:\xa0\n“Yes, he may shorten his prayers, because he has left the built-up area of his town, and all the villages that are around the airport are separate from the town. But if a person lives near the airport, he should not shorten his prayer, because he has not yet left the built-up area of his town.” (Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 4/514)\xa0\nIbn ‘Abbas said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prayed Zuhr and `Asr together in Madinah, at a time when there was no fear and he was not travelling. Abu’l-Zubayr said: I asked Sa’id [i.e., ibn Jubayr], Why did he do that? He said, I asked Ibn 'Abbas the same question, and he said, He did not want anyone among his ummah to suffer hardship. (Narrated by Muslim, 705)\xa0\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said:\xa0\n“The specific reason for shortening the prayers is travelling, and it is not permissible to shorten prayers when not travelling. With regard to joining prayers , the reason for it is if there is a need or an excuse. So if a person needs to do so, he may join prayers whilst travelling , whether he is travelling a long distance or a short one, and he may join prayers because of rain etc., or because of sickness etc., or for any other reason, because the point is to spare the Muslims any difficulty or hardship.” (Majmu’ al-Fatawa, 22/293; published by King Fahd Complex)\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20017/can-you-combine-prayers-before-travelling
418618,"I have a question about the immediate exchange when trading in the forex. For example, I have $1000 in an account with a broker, and I got involved in trading in some type of currency. After that, I concluded that deal and I made $20 straight away. When I closed the deal on the Meta Trader platform – which is a platform that is only for trading currencies and is connected to the broker – I checked my account with the broker, and I found the $20 that I had earned from the deal. Can this be regarded as being like the immediate exchange?","['Praise be to Allah.When dealing with the forex and trading in currencies, two conditions are stipulated:\n1.\xa0The deal should be done with currency that is actually in your possession, and it is not permissible to take margins or leverages from the broker, because that is a loan, and it is not permissible to combine a loan with the brokerage that is charged by the website. That is because of the report narrated by at-Tirmidhi (1234), Abu Dawud (3504) and an-Nasa’i (4611) from ‘Amr ibn Shu‘ayb, from his father, from his grandfather, who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “It is not permissible to arrange a loan combined with a sale.” Classed as sahih by at-Tirmidhi and al-Albani.\nThis includes all contracts in which a fee is paid, such as brokerage or acting as an agent in return for a fee.\nA statement to that effect was issued by the Islamic Fiqh Council, in which it says:\nSecondly: For the broker to stipulate to the customer that his business should be done through him will lead to combining a loan and the fee (brokerage). This comes under the heading of combining a loan and a sale, which is prohibited according to Islamic teachings, as the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “It is not permissible to arrange a loan combined with a sale...” Narrated by Abu Dawud (3/384) and by at-Tirmidhi (3/526), who said: It is a hasan sahih hadith.\nIn this case, he will have benefitted from his loan, and the jurists are agreed that any loan that brings a benefit comes under the heading of riba, which is prohibited. End quote.\nPlease see the answer to question no. 125758 .\n2.\xa0It is stipulated that the exchange must take place on the spot, in the meeting in which the deal was drawn up, even if that is done in a way that may be deemed as such, such as when money enters the accounts of both parties instantaneously.\nIf the money has entered your account and you are able to withdraw it, transfer it and dispose of it, and the other party is able to do likewise, then the required exchange has been accomplished.\nBut if the money enters the broker’s account, or your account with the broker, and you are not able to withdraw it until after leaving the meeting in which the deal was drawn up, then the exchange has not taken place.\nIt is not sufficient for the amount to appear in the account, without the ability to withdraw it.\nPlease see the answers to questions no. 344444 and 327070 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/418618/dealing-in-forex-and-what-may-be-regarded-as-being-like-the-immediate-exchange
