324533,"What is the ruling on wearing socks that are somewhat short if they were put on after doing wudu’, then when doing wudu’ again, I pull them up so that they cover the ankles and wipe over them?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nWhat is stipulated in order for it to be permissible to wipe over the socks\nIt is permissible to wipe over the khuffs and socks subject to certain conditions, one of which is that the socks must cover the place that must be washed when doing wudu. In other words, the socks must cover the feet and ankles, and it is not permissible to wipe over socks which come below the ankles.\nThe majority of scholars disallowed wiping over socks, but the Hanbalis permitted it if the conditions regarding the khuffs are met, one of which is that they must cover the ankles.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Mughni (1/214): It is not permissible to wipe over anything except the khuffs and anything that takes their place that is cut down, and the like, that comes above the ankles.\nWhat this means – and Allah knows best – is that the ruling on the khuffs also applies to that which takes the place of the khuffs and covers what must be washed when doing wudu, if it is possible to walk in it and it stays put by itself. That which has been cut down is the short khuff; it is only permissible to wipe over it if it covers the place that must be washed and the ankles cannot be seen, because it is tight or wrapped. This is the view of al-Shafa‘i and Abu Thawr.\nBut if it is cut so short that it comes below the ankles, it is not permissible to wipe over it. This is the correct view, narrated from Malik. It was narrated from him and from al-Awza‘i that it is permissible to wipe over it. End quote.\nIt says in Kashshaf al-Qina‘ (1/115): It is not valid to wipe over anything except that which covers the area that must be washed, which is the entire foot, otherwise it would mean that what is covered is to be wiped and what is not covered is to be washed, and there is no way to do both; therefore the entire foot [including the ankles] must be washed, because that is the basic principle. End quote.\nIbn Hazm disagreed, and said that it is permissible to wipe over [the khuff] that comes below the ankles.\nPlease see the answer to question no. 176866 .\nSecondly:\nThe ruling on socks that slip below the ankles after being wiped over\nIf you wiped over the socks when they were covering the ankles, it is valid to wipe over them. But if they slipped down below the ankles after that, doing wudu by wiping over them is not valid and your current wudu is invalidated according to the Hanbalis, who say that it is permissible to wipe over the socks.\nWhat is meant by it not being valid to do wudu by wiping over them is that it is not permissible for you to wipe over them again, until after you have done wudu in full, which includes washing your feet.\nSome of the scholars are of the view that you cannot do wudu again by wiping over the socks, but the current wudu that you did before the socks slipped down below the ankles is still valid.\nIt says in Zad al-Ma‘ad: If any part of the place that must be washed becomes exposed after wudu was invalidated or the period during which wiping over the socks is allowed expires, then the individual must do wudu all over again [which includes washing the feet].\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) favoured the view that wudu is not invalidated [if the khuffs or socks slip below the ankle), and this was regarded as more likely to be correct by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin. See: ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘ (1/264).\nIf you can no longer wipe over your socks when you do wudu because the socks have slipped below the ankles, then you will not be able to avail yourself of this concession which allows wiping over the socks. Based on that, if you want to avail yourself of this concession, then you should choose long socks that cover the ankles and will stay up, and will not drop down to the part that must be washed when doing wudu.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/324533/ruling-on-wiping-over-short-socks-if-he-pulled-them-up-above-the-ankles-and-wiped-over-them-then-they-slipped-below-the-ankles
240518,"I want to know how I can distinguish between makeup that prevents water from reaching the skin when doing Wudu and that which does not have that effect. I know that anything which forms a layer, such as nail polish for example, prevents water from reaching the skin, but there are cosmetic preparations that do not form a layer; rather they are oily to a large extent, such as lipstick and foundation cream. Do these prevent water from reaching the skin? Does everything that is waterproof – and these types cannot be removed by water only except with difficulty – prevent water reaching the skin when doing Wudu, as I have read in some chat rooms? Do powders not prevent water from reaching the skin, such as powders used on the cheeks and eyeshadow? Is there a practical way to distinguish between the two types?","['Praise be to Allah.Water must reach the skin in Wudu\nIt is essential that the water reaches all the parts of the body that are to be washed when doing Wudu . The evidence for that from the Sunnah includes the following:\nIt was narrated from Khalid ibn Ma`dan (may Allah have mercy on him), from one of the Companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) saw a man praying, and on the back of his foot there was a spot the size of a Dirham that the water had not reached, so the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed him to repeat his Wudu and his prayer. (Narrated by Abu Dawud (175); classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Irwa’ Al-Ghalil (1/127)\nThe four Schools of Fiqh agreed that in order for Wudu to be valid , it is essential to remove anything that may prevent the water from reaching the parts of the body that must be washed. (See: Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah, 43/329)\nWhat are the substances that prevent water from reaching the skin?\xa0\nThe definition of the substances that prevent water from reaching the skin is based on real-life observation. The scholars pondered this matter, and concluded that substances are of two types:\n\nSubstances that have “mass”, i.e., they remain in the form of a layer, so when they are placed on the body they remain as they are, forming an integral mass, and can be removed by peeling or wiping.\n\nExamples of that include waxy substances and paint. With regard to substances that have mass:\n\nEither they are not waterproof, such as some types of makeup and powder . In this case, when doing Wudu, it is sufficient to rub the skin well, until it is thought most likely that the water has reached the skin.\n\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“With regard to rubbing the body when doing Ghusl or rubbing the parts of the body that must be washed when doing Wudu, that is obligatory if it is not known for certain whether the water will reach where it should without rubbing it, as in the case of inner layers of thick hair. But if water may reach where it should without rubbing it, rubbing it is encouraged […] By means of rubbing, proper cleansing is achieved, and one may be certain of having made the water reach everywhere it should, which is obligatory. Hence it is prescribed, as in the case of rubbing between the fingers when doing Wudu."" (Sharh `Umdat Al-Fiqh\xa0 1/367-368)\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“What is required when doing Wudu and Ghusl is to make sure water reaches every part of the body that must be purified. As for rubbing it, that is not obligatory, but it may be essential when there is a need for it, such as if the water is very cold, or if there are traces of oil, paint and the like on that part of the body. In that case, it is essential to rub it, so as to be certain that the water has reached all the parts of the body that are to be purified."" (Fatawa Nur `Ala Ad-Darb\xa0 3/94)\n\nOr that substance may be waterproof, as in the case of some kinds of makeup. In that case it must be removed before doing Wudu, so as to ensure that the water will reach the skin when doing Wudu.\n\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Our companions said: If he puts fat or wax or dough on the cracks of his feet, or puts henna on them, and the “mass” or substance of that remains there, he must remove it, because it prevents the water from reaching the skin."" (Al-Majmu`\xa0 1/426)\n2. Substances that have no “mass”, i.e., they do not form a layer; rather when they are placed on the body, they are\xa0absorbed by the skin. Nothing is left of them; rather they may leave a trace such as colour, for example.\nExamples include most creams and oils, traces of kohl and henna, and so on. The presence of the substance does not invalidate Wudu, but if the substance is fatty or oily, then the one who is purifying himself must rub the skin well, until he thinks it most likely that the water has reached it.\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“But if the oil does not have any “mass”, and only leaves a trace on the parts of the body that are to be washed, then that does not matter. But in this case, it is essential for the individual to pass his hand over that area, because usually the oil repels water, so perhaps it may not reach all of the part that he is washing.""

247586,I have a health social worker who helps with the family's health and other needs.,"['Praise be to Allah.Is it forbidden to help others in sin?\xa0\nIt is forbidden to help others in sin, because Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Help you one another in virtue, righteousness and piety; but do not help one another in sin and transgression. And fear Allah. Verily, Allah is Severe in punishment”\xa0[Al-Ma’idah 5:2]\nAdditionally, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever calls people to guidance will have a reward like that of those who follow him, without that detracting from their reward in the slightest, and whoever calls people to misguidance will have a burden of sin like that of those who follow him, without that detracting from their burden of sin in the slightest.” (Narrated by Muslim, 4831)\nThere are other texts which prove that the one who helps someone else in sin is also sinning , such as the text which curses the one who records Riba and the two who witness it, and the curse on the one who carries alcohol (to someone who will drink it) and on the one who presses (the grapes etc with which it is made), and so on.\nNonetheless, not every kind of help is prohibited; rather what is prohibited is deliberate help in which the one who offers it intends to help the person in his sin, or direct help such as carrying alcohol or writing down contracts involving Riba.\nWith regard to indirect help, when one does not deliberately intend to help in sin, this is not prohibited; if it were to be prohibited, it would cause a great deal of hardship to people.\nFor example, it is confirmed that it is permissible to interact with the disbelievers in terms of buying, selling, lending, borrowing, and holding items in pledge, as is indicated by the authentic Sunnah, even though this involves indirectly helping them (in sin), because it is benefitting the disbeliever in financial terms, and enabling him to use that wealth in prohibited things such as Riba and the like, yet despite that Islamic teaching overlooks this kind of helping.\nCategories of helping in sin and transgression\nDr Walid Al-Minisi, a member of the Council of Islamic Jurists in America, said:\n“The issue of guidelines on helping in sin and transgression was the subject of a lengthy discussion and debate among the members of the Council of Islamic Jurists in America, in its fifth session held in Bahrain in 1428 AH.\nTo sum up the conclusion they reached: helping in sin and transgression falls into four categories:\n\nDirect and intentional help, such as someone who gives alcohol to another person with the intention of helping him to drink it.\nUnintentional, such as selling prohibited things that have a permissible use, if there is no intention to help them in using them in prohibited ways.\nIntentional but indirect, such as someone who gives another person money with which to buy alcohol. Indirect manslaughter is also included in this category .\nIndirect and unintentional, such as someone who sells things that may be used for lawful or unlawful purposes, and does not intend to help those who use them for unlawful purposes, such as someone who gives another person money not for the purpose of buying alcohol. If he buys alcohol with it and drinks it, there is no sin on the one who gave him the money, so long as he did not intend to help him with something unlawful.\n\nThis fourth category also includes buying and selling and renting from polytheists and Muslims who are evildoers, and giving money to them in charity.\nThe decision of the council was that the first three types are prohibited and the fourth type is permissible, which is the one that is not direct and not intentional.”\nAn exception is made from the fourth category in cases where it is known or thought most likely that the person who is helped will use it for sinful purposes. For this reason many of the jurists prohibited the sale of grapes to someone who will press them for wine, and the sale of weapons during times of turmoil, even though grapes and weapons may be used for both lawful and unlawful purposes.\nTherefore Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Every garment that he thinks will most likely be used for sinful purposes, it is not permissible to sell it to or sew it for one who will use it for sinful and wrong purposes. … The same applies to everything that is basically permissible, when it is known that it will be used for sinful purposes.” (Sharh Al-‘Umdah, 4/386)\nGoing back to your question, it seems that offering direct help to this employee would mean someone taking him there in his car, or buying him a ticket of admittance, and the like.\nAs for simply allowing him to park his car, this is indirect help, and there is not necessarily any connection between that and the sin; he may not go to the match, or he may go but not commit any unlawful action, such as looking at ‘Awrahs or mixing (with women) in a prohibited way. In principle, it is essential to differentiate between going to commit sin and going to do something permissible that may be accompanied by something sinful, as the jurists differentiated between someone who rents out his house to be used for sinful purposes, such as making it into a tavern, and someone who rents out his house for permissible accommodation, but alcohol is drunk in it. The former kind of renting is prohibited but not the latter.\nUndoubtedly, differentiating between direct and indirect help will vary from one issue to another. So the scholar should try to examine the case, with reference to what the jurists have mentioned about similar cases.\nTo sum up: letting this employee park his car in your driveway is not directly helping him in sinful actions such as looking at ‘Awrahs or listening to music, and other evils that are present in the stadium; rather it is helping him and comes under the same heading as helping him by selling food, drink and clothing to him. That is not prohibited on the grounds that it may help him to remain strong and healthy and enable him to commit unlawful actions, because that is indirect and unintentional help, therefore Islamic teaching overlooks it and permits us to buy and sell and engage in commercial transactions with the disbelievers, as mentioned above.\nAssisting someone take an admission exam using your laptop for loan-financed studies\nThere is nothing wrong with allowing your relative to take the acceptance test for admission to his studies using your laptop, even if he is going to pay for his studies with an interest-based loan . That is because studying is permissible, and you are only helping him with that, not with the loan.\nRather it is forbidden for him to use your computer to get this unlawful loan , because that comes under the heading of helping him with that sin.\nYou should understand that whoever takes out an interest-based loan, despite the fact that it is sinful, takes possession of the money that he borrows and it is permissible for him to make use of it with regard to his food, drink, accommodation, studies and other things, and he does not have to get rid of any of these things. So there is nothing wrong with you helping this relative and others with regard to permissible studies.\nCan you stipulate late payment fees in case of interest-free loans?\nInterest-free loans are prohibited if it is stipulated that a penalty be paid in the event of late repayment , because this comes under the heading of approving of Riba, along with the possibility of actually falling into Riba.\nIt says in a statement of the Islamic Fiqh Council belonging to the Muslim World League in Makkah, issued during its eleventh session, statement no 8:\n“If the lender stipulates that the borrower has to pay a sum of money as a financial penalty of a fixed amount or a specific percentage, if there is any delay in repayment beyond the time agreed upon by both, then this is an invalid condition, and he is not required to fulfil it; indeed it is not permissible, regardless of whether the one who stipulated it was the bank or anyone else, because this in and of itself is the Riba of the pre-Islamic era that the Quran forbids.”\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/247586/is-assisting-in-sin-a-sin

93031,"My father bought machines from a non-Muslim, knowing that they were stolen. What is the Islamic point of view concerning that? And what is the ruling on the money that I took from him and used for business?","['Praise be to Allah.Is it permissible to buy stolen goods?\nIt is not permissible to buy stolen goods – even if they were stolen from non-Muslims. This is property that is prohibited in and of itself, because it is not permissible for anyone to take possession of it, even if that is by a legitimate means such as buying it, being given it as a gift or inheriting it.\nThe person who is aware that the item they intend to purchase is stolen should denounce the thief and encourage them to repent from stealing, and to return the goods to their owner. He should try to return the goods to their owner if possible and if he knows who they are, or he should tell them where the stolen goods are, or tell the authorities about that.\xa0\nThe one who buys something knowing that it is stolen is sinning, and part of his repentance is returning it to its owner and returning its price to the one to whom he sold it.\xa0\nBuying from the thief is helping him in sin and transgression, and is encouraging the thief to carry on with what he is doing as well as failing to denounce evil. One of the conditions of a sale being valid is that the seller should be the owner of what he is selling. If he is a thief then he is not the owner, which implies that the transaction is not valid.\nScholars’ Fatwa on the prohibition of buying stolen goods\nThere follow some fatwas of scholars on what we have stated above:\xa0\n\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n\n“With regard to property that has been stolen or seized by illegitimate means and then sold in a proper manner, it does not become permissible for the one who bought it. If the Muslim knows about it then he should avoid it. If I know that a person stole some property, or he betrayed a trust or usurped it and took it from someone by force and unlawfully, then it is not permissible for me to take it from him, whether as a gift or in payment when buying or as payment of wages or as payment of a debt. This wealth is the property of the one who has been wronged ."" (Majmu` Al-Fatawa\xa0 29/323)\xa0\n\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) also said:\xa0 \xa0\n\n“If the one who is with them – the Tatars – or with anyone else has property that he knows they seized unlawfully from one whose wealth is protected in Shari`ah, then it is not permissible to buy it, but if it is bought in order to salvage it from them, then it should be returned to its owners if possible, otherwise it should be spent in the Muslims’ interests, and that is permissible."" (Majmu` Al-Fatawa\xa0 29/276)\n\nThe scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas said:\n\n“If a person is certain that a product offered for sale is stolen or seized by force, or that the one who is offering it for sale is not the legitimate owner, and is not authorized to sell it, then it is prohibited for him to buy it, because buying it is cooperating in sin and transgression. And that is also wronging people and approving of evil, and taking part in the sin. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \xa0\n“Help you one another in virtue, righteousness and piety; but do not help one another in sin and transgression.”\xa0[Al-Ma’idah 5:2]\nBased on that, the one who knows that this product is stolen or seized by force should advise the one who stole it , kindly and gently and with wisdom, to stop stealing. If he does not give it up and he persists in his crimes, then he should inform the authorities about that so that the wrongdoer may be punished and the property restored to its owners. That is cooperating in righteousness and piety, as well as deterring wrongdoers from doing wrong, and being sincere to him by stopping him and being supportive to those who have been wronged.\nHence it is proven in the Hadith which Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Support your brother whether he is a wrongdoer or the one who is wronged.” They said: O Messenger of Allah, we can support him if he is wronged, but how can we support him if he is the wrongdoer? He said: “By stopping him.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari)\nA similar report was narrated by Imam Ahmad in his Musnad. According to another report a man said: O Messenger of Allah, I can support him if he is wronged, but if he is a wrongdoer, how can I support him? He said: “Deter him from doing wrong, for that is supporting him.”\nIn light of that, supporting the wrongdoer means deterring him from his wrong deeds and transgressions, and supporting the one who has been wronged means striving to restore his rights. Preventing the wrongdoer from being able to do harm is a communal obligation. If there is no one who can do that in an official capacity or who is stronger than him and can stop the wrongdoers and sinners and deter them from their wrongdoing and crimes, then it becomes an individual responsibility, depending on one’s strength and ability, to be done with kindness and gentleness, and one will be rewarded for that in Sha Allah.” (Shaykh ‘Abd Al-‘Aziz ibn Baz, Shaykh ‘Abd Al-‘Aziz Al Ash-Shaykh, Shaykh Salih Al-Fawzan, Shaykh Bakr Abu Zayd, Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 13/82, 83)\xa0\n\nShaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\xa0\n\nI was offered something for sale and it was clear to me that it was stolen, but the one who offered it to me was not the thief, rather he had bought it from someone else who had bought it from the thief. If I bought it even though I knew that, would I be sinning, even though I do not know who the owner is from whom it was stolen?\xa0\nHe replied:\xa0\n“It seems from the Shar`i evidence that it is not permissible for you to buy it if it is clear to you or you think that most likely it is stolen, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \xa0\xa0\n“but do not help one another in sin and transgression”\xa0[Al-Ma’idah 5:2] and because you know or think that most likely the seller is not the legitimate owner and does not have permission to sell it. So how can you help him in his wrongdoing and take the property of someone else unlawfully? Yes, if you can buy it in order to save it and return it to its owner , there is nothing wrong with that, if it is not possible to seize it by force and punish the wrongdoer. However, if it is possible to take it by force and punish the wrongdoer in accordance with Shari’ah, this is what must be done, because of the well known evidence in the Hadith: “Support your brother whether he is a wrongdoer or has been wronged…” (Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 19/91-92)\xa0\nRuling on taking wealth from the father who used to buy stolen goods\nAs for you taking wealth from your father , there is nothing wrong with that, because if a person’s wealth is mixed and includes both prohibited and permissible wealth, there is nothing wrong with interacting with him by buying, selling, exchanging gifts, loans and so on. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) dealt with the Jews who consumed Riba and prohibited wealth.\xa0\nBut if the wealth that you take from your father is the actual stolen property , then it is not permissible for your father or for you.\xa0\nFinally, you should advise your father to seek that which is permissible and avoid that which is prohibited, for every body that is nourished with something prohibited, the Fire is more befitting for it.\xa0\nWe ask Allah to make you independent of means by that which He has permitted so that you will have no need of that which He has forbidden, by His bounty.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/93031/is-it-prohibited-in-islam-to-buy-stolen-goods
