397034,"I have sworn an oath about this sin I have been addicted to and I am trying desperately to rid myself of it. In my oath, I stated that if I do this sin, for a week I will have to perform ghusl every day and pray 8 rakah nawafil as expiation. And If I repeat the sin, another week will be added, and so on. I have been stuck in this loop and keep doing the sin and now I owe over 6 months of prayers, this has become extremely burdensome for me to carry out and I am now struggling mentally and externally to cope with my addiction. I have stated in my oath that if I do this sin, and do not do the expiation of ghusl and 8 rakah for even a day, I will have committed kufr, I am wasting huge amounts of water and time performing this every day, and my family is fed up. Is there any way for me to break free from this loop and expiate the oath?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIf someone swears that if they commit a sin, they will perform ghusl\xa0(a full-body ritual wash)\xa0every day and pray eight optional Rak`ahs for a week, and if they repeat the sin, they will add another week, then if they fall into sin and do not perform the ghusl and do not pray, they have broken their oath, and they must perform the expiation for breaking an oath. This will release them from their oath.\nThe expiation for breaking an oath is: freeing a slave, or feeding ten needy people, or clothing them. If one cannot do these, then fasting for three days is required, as Allah the Exalted says (translation of the meaning):\n{Allah will not impose blame upon you for what is meaningless in your oaths, but He will impose blame upon you for [breaking] what you intended of oaths. So its expiation is the feeding of ten needy people from the average of that which you feed your [own] families or clothing them or the freeing of a slave. But whoever cannot find [or afford it] - then a fast of three days [is required]. That is the expiation for oaths when you have sworn. But guard your oaths.} This verse is from Surat Al-Ma\'idah/89.\nIt is sufficient to give each needy person a meal, or one and a half kilograms of rice.\nSecondly:\nIf someone swears that if they commit a sin and do not perform the ghusl and pray eight Rak`ahs, even for just one day, they will become a disbeliever, they have sinned by making this prohibited oath, but they do not become a disbeliever by doing so; because they detest disbelief and want to prevent themselves from something, so they make it severe by mentioning something they hate and are repelled by, which is disbelief.\nHowever, if they break the oath: they must perform the expiation for breaking an oath.\nAt-Tirmidhi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his Sunan (4/115): ""The scholars have differed concerning this matter when a man swears by a religion other than Islam, saying: \'He is a Jew or a Christian if he does such and such,\' and then he does that thing. Some of them said: \'He has done something grave and there is no expiation upon him,\' and this is the view of the people of Madinah, and it is the view of Malik ibn Anas. Abu `Ubaid also held this view.\nSome of the scholars among the Companions (may Allah be pleased with him) and the Successors and others said: \'He must perform expiation,\' and this is the view of Sufyan, Ahmad, and Ishaq."" End quote.\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n""If he says: \'He is a Jew or a Christian if he does such and such,\' or \'He is a disbeliever if he does such and such,\' then the Imams are agreed that if the condition is met, he does not become a disbeliever, but he must perform the expiation for breaking an oath according to Abu Hanifah and Ahmad in the well-known view from him. According to Malik and Ash-Shafi`i, there is nothing upon him.\nUnlike if he says: \'If you give me the dirhams, I will disbelieve,\' then he does become a disbeliever by that; his disbelief is enacted immediately [i.e., he disbelieves right away just by saying these words]; because he intended the occurrence of disbelief when the condition is met."" End quote from ""Majmu` al-Fatawa"" (33/199).\nIn conclusion:\nYou are required to perform two expiations, one for swearing by Allah and another for swearing on disbelief. With this, you will be released from this predicament you have put yourself in. Then you should strive to abandon the sin and treat the addiction to it, and we ask Allah to accept from you and to help you.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/397034/swearing-to-pray-if-she-breaks-an-oath-or-she-is-not-a-muslim
39408,What is the ruling on putting nutmeg in food? Is it permissible to sell it?,"['Praise be to Allah.What is nutmeg?\nThe nutmeg tree is used as a kind of spice which gives food a fragrant smell and delicious taste. The ancient Egyptians used it as a medicine for stomach disease and to expel wind.\xa0\nIts effects are like those of hashish. If it is consumed in large quantities, a person ringing in his ears, severe constipation, difficulty urinating, anxiety, stress, suppression of the central nervous system and possibly death.\xa0\nIs nutmeg prohibited?\nWith regard to the rulings on it, the scholars differed and there are two opinions.\xa0\nThe majority of scholars are of the view that it is prohibited to use it in small and large quantities. Others are of the view that it is permissible to use a little of it if it is mixed with other substances. \xa0\nIbn Hajar Al-Haytami (d. 974 AH) (may Allah have mercy on him) said concerning nutmeg:\xa0\n“When there was a dispute concerning it between the scholars of the Haramayn and Egypt, and there were differences of opinion as to whether it is permissible or prohibited, this question arose: Did any of the imams or their followers state that it is prohibited to eat nutmeg?\xa0\nTo sum up the answer – as was stated clearly by Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Daqeeq Al-Eid – it is an intoxicant. Ibn Al-`Imad went further and regarded hashish as comparable to it. The Malikis, Shafa’is and Hanbalis agreed that it is an intoxicant and comes under the general text: “Every intoxicant is Khamr and all Khamr is prohibited.” The Hanafis are of the view that it is either an intoxicant or a drug, either of which affects the mind, so it is prohibitedin either case.” (See: Az-Zawajir `an Iqtirab Al-Kaba’ir (1/212) and Al-Mukhaddirat by Muhammad `Abd Al-Maqsud (p. 90)\nDuring the eighth conference of medical Fiqh – “The Islamic View on Some Health Problems – prohibited and Impure Substances in Food and Medicine” – which was held in Kuwait between 22-24 Dhul-Hijjah 1415 AH (22-24 May 1995), they said:\xa0\n“Narcotic substances are prohibited, and it is not permissible to consume them unless that is for a specific medical purpose, and in the amount specified by doctors, but they are pure in and of themselves.\xa0\nThere is nothing wrong with using nutmeg to improve the flavour of food, in small amounts that do not cause listlessness or intoxication.”\nShaykh Dr. Wahbah Az-Zuhayli (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“There is no reason why a small amount of nutmeg should not be used to improve the flavour of food, cakes and the like, but a large amount is prohibited, because it is a narcotic.”\xa0\nBut to be on the safe side we should say that it is not allowed even if it is mixed with other things and there is only a small amount of it, because “that which intoxicates in large amounts, a small amount of it is prohibited.”\xa0\nIt should be noted that it is prohibited to import nutmeg – both seed and powder – into the Land of the Two Holy Mosques (i.e., Saudi Arabia) and it is permitted only to import it when it is mixed with other spices in permitted proportions, which is no more than 20%.\xa0\nFor more details, please refer to the following answers: 82116 , 227982 , 125974 , 107381 , 114855 , and 111827 .\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/39408/is-nutmeg-prohibited
393085,My sister swore that she would recite Tabarak every night. but she could not do this for 10 years. because she was feeling very tired. what should my sister do?,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIf a Muslim swears to perform an act of obedience, it is recommended for them to fulfill their oath and not to break it.\nAl-Mardawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said, ""Fulfilling an oath regarding a recommended act is preferable."" End quote from ""Al-Insaf"" (27/497).\nMeaning: If the subject of the oath is a recommended act, then fulfilling the oath is preferable to breaking it.\nIf one breaks the oath and does not do what they swore to do, then they must offer expiation for the oath, by consensus of the Jurists.\nAl-Wazir Ibn Hubayrah (may Allah have mercy on him) said, ""They have unanimously agreed that a deliberate and binding oath is when one swears by Allah to do something in the future, whether to do it or not to do it, and if one breaks the oath, expiation becomes obligatory on them."" End quote from ""Hashiyah Ibn Al-Qasim `Ala Ar-Rawd Al-Murbi`"" (7/469).\nSecondly:\nAllah the Almighty mentioned the expiation for an oath in the Quran: {Allah will not impose blame upon you for what is meaningless\xa0in your oaths, but He will impose blame upon you for [breaking] what you intended of oaths. So its expiation\xa0is the feeding of ten needy people from the average of that which you feed your [own] families or clothing them or the freeing of a slave. But whoever cannot find [or afford it] - then a fast of three days [is required]. That is the expiation for oaths when you have sworn. But guard your oaths.\xa0Thus does Allāh make clear to you His verses [i.e., revealed law] that you may be grateful.}\xa0Surat Al-Ma\'idah (5:89).\nThis has been explained in detail in the answer to question number (45676 ).\nThirdly:\nIf a Muslim offers expiation for their oath, then this expiation cancels out the oath, making it as if it never existed.\nAl-Qurtubi said in his Tafsir (18/185), ""Allah\' saying (translation of the meaning): {Allah has already ordained for you [Muslims] the dissolution of your oaths}\xa0means the expiation of the oath is its dissolution.""\nMeaning: If you wish to make lawful what you have sworn upon."" End quote.\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said, ""{Allah has already ordained for you [Muslims] the dissolution of your oaths}... The meaning is: Allah has prescribed for you the dissolution of the oath, which is its annulment, the opposite of binding. And for this reason, those among our companions and others, like Abu Bakr `Abd Al-`Aziz, have used this verse as evidence for expiation before breaking the oath, because the dissolution does not occur after breaking the oath; for by breaking the oath, it is dissolved; and the dissolution only occurs if the expiation is given before breaking the oath, so that the oath may be dissolved, and after breaking the oath, it is only an expiation; because it expiates what is in the breaking of the oath from the cause of sin due to breaking Allah\'s covenant."" End quote from Majmu` Al-Fatawa (35/253).\nFrom this, it is understood that the dissolution of an oath occurs by one of two things: either by breaking the oath or by offering the expiation before breaking it.\nBased on this, what is obligatory upon your sister is to offer the expiation for the oath, and by this, her oath will be dissolved, and nothing else is required of her.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/393085/breaking-an-oath-for-several-years
21756,What is the ruling on praying Witr at the time of `Isha’ when travelling and shortening the obligatory prayers?,"['Praise be to Allah.Shortening prayers while travelling\xa0\n“Travelling is a reason which permits the four-Rak`ah prayers to be shortened to two Rak`ahs , rather it – i.e. travel – is the reason which dictates shortening four Rak`ah prayers to two Rak`ahs , and this is either obligatory or recommended, depending on the differences in scholarly opinion.\xa0\nThe correct view is that shortening prayers is recommended and is not obligatory; although there are some texts which apparently indicate that it is obligatory, there are other texts which indicate that it is not obligatory.”\xa0\nThe four-Rak`ah prayers are Dhuhr, `Asr and `Isha, and the evidence for that is the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and the consensus of the ummah.\xa0\nIn the Quran, Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And when you (Muslims) travel in the land, there is no sin on you if you shorten the prayer if you fear that the disbelievers may put you in trial (attack you).” [An-Nisa’ 4:101]\nAnd evidence is to be found in the actions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) travelled, he would pray two Rak`ahs. It was not narrated from him that he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) ever prayed four Rak`ahs whilst travelling, rather during all of his journeys, long and short, he would pray two Rak`ahs .”\xa0\nWith regard to the consensus of the Muslims, this is something which is a well-known and well-established part of the religion, as Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I prayed behind the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and Abu Bakr, ‘Umar and `Uthmaan, and they never prayed more than two Rak`ahs when travelling.” And the Muslims are agreed upon that.\xa0\nPraying Witr when combining ‘Isha with Maghrib\xa0\nThe traveller may pray Witr after praying `Isha with Maghrib and praying them at the time of Maghrib.”\xa0(See Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, vol. 1, p. 412; al-Sharh al-Mumti’, vol. 4, p. 502; Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, vol. 8, p. 144)\nFor more details about Witr, please refer to these answers: 46544 , 36793 , 32577 , 216236 , and 65692 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21756/how-to-pray-witr-if-you-combine-maghrib-with-isha
