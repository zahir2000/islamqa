438124,"I live in France, and my son has become gay, unfortunately. I have two questions, which I hope you will answer and for which I thank you in advance. Am I responsible before Allah for what he does? I have cut off all ties with him; is this permissible, or is it regarded as coming under the heading of severing ties of kinship?","['Praise be to Allah.We have read your message, and we understand your suffering and share your grief. We ask Almighty Allah to grant your son well-being and to guide him back to the straight path and make him one of His righteous slaves, and to make the day come when you will have the joy of seeing him return to the right path.\nYour question refers to two issues:\nThe first issue has to do with whether you are responsible before Allah for your son’s deviation.\nIt is no secret that Allah has put parents in charge of raising their children, and He has commanded them to do that. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{O you who believe, guard yourselves and your families against a fire whose fuel is men and stones, over which are [appointed] angels harsh and stern, who do not disobey Allah in whatever He commands them, and they do whatever they are commanded to do}\xa0[at-Tahrim 66:6].\nAnd the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Each of you is in a position of responsibility and each of you is answerable for those under his care. The ruler of the people is in a position of responsibility and is answerable for those under his care. A man is in a position of responsibility over his household and is answerable for those under his care. A woman is in a position of responsibility over her husband’s house and children and is answerable for those under her care. The servant is in a position of responsibility over his master’s wealth and is answerable for it.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (853).\nWe cannot evaluate the extent to which you fulfilled this responsibility in a country where you are confronted with forces that have a deep impact on children in schools, the media and elsewhere. The responsibility is greater for one who chose to live in a non-Muslim country with his children, as Muslim families pay a high moral price for this choice.\nHence the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) emphatically forbade the Muslim to settle in the lands of non-Muslims. He only did that because of the great evils that result from settling in such lands, from which no one except Allah can save him.\nIf there was any shortcoming or neglect, then you must repent and seek Allah’s forgiveness.\nWhatever the case, what must be done is to seek a solution to the current problem, deal with what has happened, and strive to prevent what has not happened, lest this happen again – Allah forbid – with his younger siblings.\nPlease see the answer to question no. 52893 .\nThe second part of your question has to do with your cutting off ties with your son.\nYou did not state your son’s age in the question, or when the signs of deviant behaviour began to appear in him. Whatever the case, before cutting off ties with him, there are steps and effectives measures that could be taken to bring him back to the straight path and rid him of this deviation, especially if he is below the age of twenty. In that case, cutting off ties with him may make him go even further astray, because you are living in a society which embraces such cases and makes them deviate further. What we advise you to do is the following:\n1. Do not cut off ties with him or kick him out of the house. His remaining with you will give you more chances to try to set him straight by direct and indirect means.\nYou can take him with you to Islamic centres or places which you think will help to expedite his repentance and rid him of this problem.\nSo long as a person’s soul is still in his body, there should be no despair.\nLut continued to communicate with his people until the last moment, despite their persisting in committing evil actions, individually and in groups.\nOne of the greatest remedies for one who is tested with this calamity is to remind him of Allah and warn him of His punishment, and remind him of what happened to the people of Lut and the divine wrath that befell them. If he fears Allah and hopes for that which is with Him, that will enable him to start resisting this urge and will prompt him to deal with it, and give up his whims and desires, and even his sickness and deviance.\n2. You should be close to him and take him with you whenever you can. You should organize some Islamic activities with him and the rest of the family, such as reading Qur’an or some of the Prophet’s biography (Sirah). Perhaps you could take him on a trip for ‘umrah, and that may be a step along the way to change him.\n3. You should try to move from the neighbourhood where you are living, to a neighbourhood in which there are more opportunities to help expedite his recovery and rid him of this deviance, even if that causes you some trouble or means returning to your Muslim homeland.\n4. Remember that the door of hope is always open, so stay close to it and try to influence him indirectly by showing him some examples of heroic and manly behaviour, such as documentaries and moving clips which convey messages of dignity and heroism. All of these are messages that will go to the subconscious and address part of the problem, in sha Allah, and help in bringing him back to the right path.\n5.. Keeping busy with some work that will occupy his time and benefit him physically and financially, such as strenuous physical exercises, or part-time work that does not leave him with free time, but will benefit him financially.\nHowever, before all of that, strive hard in constantly calling upon Allah and asking Him to grant him well-being and bring him back to the truth and the straight path, and to grant him wisdom and enable him to repent sincerely.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/438124/advice-for-dealing-with-a-gay-son
224152,"What is the evidence from the Quran and Sunnah for reciting quietly in Dhuhr and `Asr, when the recitation in Fajr, Maghrib and `Isha’ is done out loud?","['Praise be to Allah.Which prayers are prayed loudly?\nWe thank you for this concern and appreciate your interest in finding out the evidence from the Quran and Sunnah at such a young age, and we ask Allah to make you of benefit to others.\nAllah, may He be glorified and exalted, has commanded us to follow the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and emulate him, as He, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“There has certainly been for you in the Messenger of Allah an excellent pattern for anyone whose hope is in Allah and the Last Day and [who] remembers Allah often.” [Al-Ahzab 33:21]\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Pray as you have seen me praying .” The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to recite out loud in Fajr prayer and the first two Rak`ahs of Maghrib and `Isha’, and he would recite quietly in all other cases.\xa0\nEvidence for reciting out loud and quietly in the five daily prayers\nTexts which refer to reciting out loud include the following:\n\nThe report narrated by Al-Bukhari (735) and Muslim (463) from Jubayr ibn Mut`im (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) reciting [Surat] At-Tur in Maghrib.\nThe report narrated by Al-Bukhari (733) and Muslim (464) from Al-Bara` (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: I heard the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) reciting “Wat-tini waz-zaytun” [i.e., Surat At-Tin] in `Isha’ prayer, and I never heard anyone with a more beautiful voice than him.\xa0\nThe report narrated by Al-Bukhari (739) and Muslim (449) from Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) about the jinn coming and listening to the Quran from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), in which it says that he was leading his companions in Fajr prayer, and when they heard the Quran they listened attentively to it.\n\nThese Hadiths indicate that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to recite out loud in such a way that those who were present could hear it.\nEvidence that the recitation is to be done quietly in Dhuhr and `Asr prayers includes the following:\n\nThe report narrated by Al-Bukhari (713) from Khabbab (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which someone asked him: Did the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) recite Quran in Dhuhr and `Asr? He said: Yes. We said: How did you know that? He said: From the movement of his beard [as he recited quietly].\n\nThus it becomes clear that reciting out loud in the prayers where that is to be done and reciting quietly in the prayers where that is to be done is the Sunnah of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and the Muslims unanimously agreed on these rulings.\nAl-Bukhari (738) and Muslim (396) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: In every prayer you should recite. What the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) made us hear we make you hear, and what he recited quietly we recite quietly.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“The Sunnah is to recite out loud in the (first) two Rak`ahs of Fajr, Maghrib and `Isha’, and in Jumu`ah, and to recite quietly in Dhuhr and `Asr, and the third Rak`ah of Maghrib, and the third and fourth rak`ahs of `Isha’. All of this is according to the consensus of the Muslims, in addition to the authentic Hadiths that all indicate that.” (Al-Majmu` Sharh Al-Muhadhdhab, 3/389)\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Recitation should be done quietly in Dhuhr and `Asr, and out loud in the first two Rak`ahs of Maghrib and `Isha’, and in all of Fajr prayer. … The basis for that is the action of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), as is proven by the narration of later generations from earlier generations. If a person recites out loud in a place where the recitation should be done quietly, or recites quietly in a place where recitation should be done out loud, he has neglected the Sunnah, although his prayer is valid.” (Al-Mughni, 2/270)\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 67618 , 26268 , 197414 , 91325 , and\xa0 114369 .\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/224152/which-prayers-are-prayed-loudly
489220,"I am divorced and I have two daughters. I take some of my daughters’ maintenance money every month for my medical treatment, because I am sick. With regard to my daughters’ food and drink, it is my father who is sponsoring that. What is the ruling on my taking some of my daughters’ money every month? Please note that I have no other option except to do that.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe basic principle is that the mother who has custody of her children does not have the right to take anything from her children’s maintenance money in return for taking care of them; rather she is entrusted with the money that is sent for her children’s maintenance and is expected to dispose of it according to what is in their best interests.\nAd-Dardir al-Maliki (may Allah have mercy on him) said: She does not have the right to spend any of her child’s maintenance money on herself in return for taking care of the child. End quote from Bulghat as-Salik li Aqrab al-Masalik (2/765).\nSecondly:\nIt is permissible for the father and mother to take from their children’s wealth for their needs, so long as it does not harm the children.\nIt was narrated from ‘A’ishah, from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), that he said: “A man’s son is part of his earnings, among the best of his earnings, so you may take from their wealth.” Narrated by Abu Dawud (3529); classed as sahih by al-Albani.\nIbn al-Amir as-San‘ani (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is soundly narrated from Abu’z-Zubayr that he heard Jabir ibn ‘Abdillah say: The father and mother may take from their child’s wealth without his permission.\nEnd quote from Risalah Latifah fi Sharh Hadith Anta wa Maluka li Abik (p. 24). The report was narrated by Ibn Hazm in al-Muhalla with his isnad (6/385).\nIt was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Your children are a gift from Allah to you, {He gives to whom He wills female [children], and He gives to whom He wills males} [al-Shoora 42:49]. They and their wealth are yours if you need it.” Narrated by al-Hakim in al-Mustadrak (3123), who said: It is sahih according to the conditions of al-Bukhari and Muslim. Also narrated by al-Bayhaqi in al-Kubra (15745). Classed as sahih by al-Albani in as-Silsilah as-Sahihah (2564). See the commentary of Shu‘ayb al-Arna’ut et al. on Sunan Ibn Majah, hadith no. 2137.\nAs-Sawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said, explaining that it is permissible for the mother to take from her child’s wealth, if she is in difficulty, and she does not regard it as being in return for looking after the child:\nShe does not have the right to spend on herself in return for looking after the child.\nBut if it is for another reason – meaning that she takes it for a reason other than looking after the child – and is in difficulty, then she may spend on herself from the child’s wealth, whether what she takes is less than the going rate for looking after the child or more than that, because she is entitled to maintenance even if she does not look after the child.\nEnd quote from Hashiyat as-Sawi ‘ala ash-Sharh as-Saghir (2/765).\nShaykh Salih al-Fawzan (may Allah preserve him) said: The father has the right to take from his child’s wealth so long as it will not harm the child or take what the child needs, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The best of what you consume is your earnings, and your children are among your earnings.” And he said: “You and your wealth belong to your father.” This undoubtedly refers to the father’s rights, but it also includes the mother’s rights, because she is like the father according to the correct view. So she may take from her child’s wealth that which will benefit her and meet her needs, so long as that will not be detrimental to the child and what she takes is not needed by him.\nEnd quote from al-Muntaqa min Fatawa al-Fawzan.\nBased on the above:\nIt is permissible for you to take from your children’s wealth to pay for medical treatment, on condition that that will not harm the children. In other words, that should only be after ensuring that the children have enough.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/489220/is-it-permissible-for-the-mother-to-take-some-of-the-wealth-of-her-children-who-are-in-her-custody
