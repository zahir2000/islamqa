307202,"In one of my physics classes, I had a discussion with my professor about the five necessities, as he said that preserving life is more important than preserving faith, and I told him that preserving faith is more important. But he was not convinced of what I said, and he quoted as evidence the fact that Islam permits patients with chronic diseases (diabetes and so on) [to break the fast in Ramadan if fasting is dangerous for them]. He asked for evidence from the Qur’an and Sunnah, and for the views of senior jurists (such as Ibn Taymiyah, ash-Shafa‘i and other jurists) in order to be convinced. I would like you to give me these views, with commentary and sources.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe five necessities are: faith, life, reason, lineage and wealth. Some scholars also add: honour.\nAz-Zarkashi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: What is regarded as interest (maslahah) may be divided on the basis of how strong the interest is in and of itself, or in relation to the individual’s need for that interest, into the following categories: essential, needed or embellishment.\nFirstly, that which is essential is that which is needed and cannot be done without in the upholding of spiritual or worldly well-being, in the sense that if it is lacking, worldly affairs will not be sound and there will be corruption, turmoil and loss of life; and in the hereafter there will be no salvation or eternal bliss, and there will be clear loss.\nThat which is essential is that which helps to preserve one of the five objectives of sharia, which are:\nPreservation of faith, by legislating execution and fighting; execution for apostasy and other crimes that incur capital punishment serves the interest of Islamic faith, as does fighting in jihad those disbelievers who are at war with the Muslims.\nPreservation of life, by legislating legal retribution (qisas).\nPreservation of reason, by legislating the hadd punishment for consuming intoxicants.\nPreservation of lineage by prohibiting zina and legislating punishments for it.\nPreservation of wealth by imposing liability on the one who transgresses against it, and by cutting off the hand of the thief.\nThese objectives are summed up in the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{O Prophet, when the believing women come to you pledging to you that they will not associate anything with Allāh, nor will they steal, nor will they commit unlawful sexual intercourse, nor will they kill their children, nor will they fabricate any lie concerning that which is between their arms and legs [namely a child]}\xa0[Al-Mumtahanah 60:12].\nAt-Tufi al-Hanbali added a sixth objective, in which at-Taj as-Subki followed him, namely the preservation of honour (or reputation). People of reason usually offer their life and wealth to protect their honour and reputation, and the thing that is protected by sacrificing something that is a necessity is more likely to be a necessity itself. (End quote from Tashnif al-Masami‘ Sharh Jam‘ al-Jawami‘, 3/15)\nSecondly:\nThe well-known scholarly view is that preservation of faith takes precedence over preservation of life, hence jihad in Allah’s cause – which aims to preserve faith – is prescribed, even though it is possible that it will lead to loss of lives and wealth.\nAl-Jalal al-Mahalli said in Sharh Jam‘ al-Jawami‘ (3/322): That which is a necessity is that for which the need may reach such a level that makes it a necessity, such as preservation of faith. In that case, what is prescribed is to fight the disbelievers and punish those who promote innovations (bid‘ah). Then comes preservation of life, for which retaliatory punishment (qisas) is prescribed. Then comes preservation of reason, for which the hadd punishment for consumption of intoxicants is prescribed. Then comes preservation of lineage, for which the hadd punishment for zina is prescribed. Then comes preservation of wealth, for which the hadd punishments for theft and banditry is prescribed. Then comes preservation of honour, for which the hadd punishment for slander is prescribed. The author added this last point, as at-Tufi did, and he added it with the conjunction wa (“and”) so as to indicate that it is as important as wealth, whereas the four necessities mentioned before it are connected by the conjunction fa (translated here as “then comes”), which indicates that they appear in decreasing order of importance.\nHowever, this order of importance is subject to differences of scholarly opinion, and the order may differ when these ideas are implemented.\nIbn Amir al-Haj (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Preservation of faith, which is one of the necessities, is given precedence over all others when there is a conflict, because it is the greatest objective. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me}\xa0[Adh-Dhariyat 51:56].\nMoreover, the other objectives are sought for the sake of preserving faith, because the outcome of preserving faith is the most perfect of outcomes, for it has to do with attaining eternal bliss with the Lord of the Worlds.\nNext, precedence should be given to preserving life over preserving lineage, reason and wealth, because it is connected to the interest of faith, which can only be attained through acts of worship, and acts of worship are dependent upon the survival of the individual.\nNext, precedence should be given to preservation of lineage over the remaining objectives, because it is essential to the survival of the child. By prohibiting zina, there will be no mixing of lineages, so the child will be attributed to one person, who will take care of raising him and preserving his life, otherwise the child may be neglected and die, because he is not able to look after himself.\nNext, precedence should be given to preservation of reason over the preservation of wealth, because loss of reason may lead to loss of life, to the extent that when a person loses his reason, he begins to behave like an animal and becomes no longer accountable. If someone causes another person to lose his reason, a complete penalty is due, like the penalty incurred when a person’s life is lost, namely blood money (diyah).\nNext comes preservation of wealth. And it was said that preservation of wealth may be given precedence over preservation of faith, let alone preservation of life, reason and lineage, as more than one of the scholars narrated. It is more appropriate to give precedence to these four over preservation of faith, because they are rights that belong to the human being, and the human being is intolerant and stingy with regard to his rights, and he may be harmed if he misses out on these things, whereas faith and religious commitment are rights that belong to Allah, may He be exalted, and the rights of Allah are based on tolerance and forgiveness. Moreover, Allah is independent of means and is sublime, so He will not be harmed if some people fall short in their duties towards Him. One example of giving precedence to these things over preservation of faith is not attending Jumu‘ah and prayers in congregation, which are both religious matters, in order to preserve wealth, which is a worldly matter. Abu Yusuf said: Prayer may be interrupted for the sake of a dirham that you fear may be stolen from you. In the wording of the book al-Khulasah: If a dirham is stolen from a person or from someone else, he may interrupt his prayer, whether it is obligatory or supererogatory. (End quote from at-Taqrir wa’t-Tahbir, 3/231).\nThus you will realize that the view which gives precedence to preserving life is a sound view, and there is a great deal of proof to support it, such as the fact that it is permissible to utter words of disbelief when one is compelled to do so for the purpose of preserving one’s life, and that it is permissible to eat meat that was not slaughtered in the prescribed manner and to drink alcohol, when forced by necessity for the purpose of preserving one’s life. This is in addition to the fact that it is permissible not to attend Jumu‘ah and prayers in congregation if one fears for one’s life because of an enemy or a wild animal, and the like.\nAl-Amidi spoke at length in support of the view that precedence is to be given to preserving what is fundamental to faith, and he refuted the argument that suggests otherwise.\nAmong other things, he (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Their argument is that what is essential to preserving life takes precedence, on the grounds that the purpose of faith and belief is to fulfil the rights of Allah and the purpose of the other necessities is to preserve the rights of the human being. The rights of the human being may take precedence over the rights of Allah, may He be exalted, because they are based on stinginess and intolerance, whereas the rights of Allah are based on tolerance and ease. Allah, may He be exalted, will not be harmed if His rights are not fulfilled, therefore preserving the rights of the human being takes precedence over preserving the rights of the One Who will not be harmed if His rights are not fulfilled. Hence we give precedence to the rights of the human being over the rights of Allah, may He be exalted, on the grounds that if there is a conflict between the rights of Allah, may He be exalted, and the rights of the human being in a particular situation, and it is difficult to fulfil\xa0 both, as in the case of one who apostatised and killed someone deliberately and with malice aforethought, then we execute him in retribution (qisas) for murder, not for his disbelief (apostasy).\nMoreover, we give precedence to preserving life over preserving faith and religious duties, as we reduce the burden of the traveller by waiving two rak‘ahs [from the four-rak‘ah prayer] and excusing him from fasting, and we reduce the burden of the one who is sick by allowing him not to pray standing and not to fast. We also give precedence to preserving life over upholding the prayer in the case of having to save a drowning person. Even clearer than that is the fact that we give precedence to preserving wealth over preserving faith when we allow a person not to attend Jumu‘ah and prayer in congregation when there is the necessity to preserve the least amount of wealth, and we give precedence to the interests of the Muslims which have to do with allowing ahl adh-dhimmah to live among them over the preservation of faith, to the extent that we protect the life and wealth of the dhimmi, even though in other circumstances it is permissible to fight disbelievers.\nIn refutation of the above, we say: with regard to preservation of life, although it is connected to the rights of the human being with regard to some rulings, it is also connected to the rights of Allah, may He be exalted, with regard to other rulings. Therefore it is prohibited to kill oneself or to behave in ways that could lead to loss of one’s life. So giving precedence to either of them is to be determined by examining the rights of both, and there is nothing to prevent giving precedence to the rights of Allah or the rights of the human being in issues that have to do purely with the rights of Allah.\nWith regard to reducing the burden for the traveller and the one who is sick, it is not to be understood as giving precedence to preserving life over preserving one of the fundamentals of faith; rather it is giving precedence to preservation of life over one of the minor issues of faith, and the minor issues of a fundamental matter are not the same as the fundamental matter itself.\nMoreover, it is worth noting that the difficulty involved in praying two rak‘ahs when travelling is equal to the difficulty involved in praying four rak‘ahs when not travelling. Similarly, the difficulty involved in the sick person praying sitting is the same as the difficulty involved in his praying standing when he is in good health. So in principle, there is no difference.\nWith regard to fasting, the individual does not miss out on fasting completely; rather the fast is deferred until he is able to make it up.\nThe arguments mentioned above refute what they said regarding the scenario of saving a drowning person, not attending Jumu‘ah or prayers in congregation in order to preserve wealth, and allowing ahl adh-dhimmah to remain among the Muslims and protecting their lives and wealth. That is not because it serves the interests of the Muslims; rather it is so that the dhimmi may see the beauties of Islam and learn about the fundamentals of the faith, so that his heart will be softened towards it, in the hope that he will be guided. That is in the interests of faith and is not in the interest of anything else. (End quote from al-Ihkam fi Usul al-Ahkam, 4/275).\nTherefore, the difference of scholarly opinion regarding the order of importance of these objectives is valid, and each view has its proof and evidence.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/307202/the-five-necessities-and-the-difference-of-opinion-as-to-whether-preservation-of-faith-should-be-given-precedence-over-preservation-of-life
126692,Can you kindly tell me what kind of dress did Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to wear? Kindly quote the Hadith and the reference number with your answer?,"['Praise be to Allah.In the Sunnah, there are reports which describe several types of clothing that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to wear.\nTo sum up, the reports say that he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to wear whatever garments were readily available and were customary among his people. So he did not reject that which was available, he did not go to great lengths to obtain that which was not available, he did not wear anything that made him stand out from other people, and he did not restrict himself to wearing only one type of clothing. Rather he wore all kinds of fabric except silk, and all kinds of garments that were covering and beautiful.\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) compiled a summary of the Hadiths which describe the clothing of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), which we will quote here in brief. We will not burden the reader by quoting all the Hadiths which speak of this topic, as they may be found in the books of the Sunnah, and one may refer to them in the sections on clothing and adornment.\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nHe (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) had a turban [i.e., that which is wrapped around the head, as is the dress of ordinary people in some countries nowadays, such as Yemen and Sudan] that was called As-Sahab (“the cloud”), which he gave to `Ali. Under it he wore a cap (Qalansuwah).\nSometimes he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) wore the cap without the turban, and sometimes he wore the turban without the cap. When he put on the turban, he let the ends hang down between his shoulder blades, as Muslim narrated from `Amr ibn Hurayth (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: I saw the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on the minbar wearing a black turban, with its two ends hanging down between his shoulder blades.\nMuslim also narrated from Jabir ibn `Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) entered Makkah wearing a black turban. The Hadith of Jabir does not mention the end of the turban, which indicates that he did not always let the end hang down between his shoulder blades. It may be said that he entered Makkah wearing a battle dress and a cap of chain mail on his head, because in every situation he wore what was appropriate.\nHe (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) also wore a Qamis or chemise [which is like the thobes that are known nowadays and in some countries they are called Galabiyah]. This was the most beloved of garments to him. The sleeves came down to the wrists.\nHe also wore the Jubbah [which is an overgarment with wide sleeves that is open at the front and is worn over the thobe. It is similar to the Jubbah worn nowadays at Al-Azhar University. (Al-Mu`jam Al-Wasit, 1/104)].\nThe Farruj – which is like the Qaba’ [a garment that is worn over other garments and with a cummerbund or waist sash]. (Al-Mu`jam Al-Wasit, 2/713)]\nThe Farjiyyah [a loose, long-sleeved garment that is worn by religious scholars. (Al-Mu`jam Al-Wasit, 2/679)].\nWhen travelling, he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) wore a Jubbah with tight sleeves.\nHe (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) wore the Izar (waist-wrapper or lower garment) and Rida’ (upper garment) [these are the garments that people wear in ihram today]. Al-Waqidi said: His Rida’ and Burd (types of upper garment) were six cubits long and three cubits and a handspan wide. His Izar was made of Omani cloth; it was four cubits and a handspan long and two cubits and a handspan wide.\nHe (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) wore a red Hullah. The Hullah (suit) was composed of an Izar and Rida’; the word simply refers to two garments worn together. Those who thought that it was pure red, not mixed with any other colour, are mistaken. Rather the red suit was two pieces of Yemeni cloth woven with red and black stripes, like all Yemeni clothes. They were known by this name because they contained red stripes. Otherwise, pure red is emphatically disallowed.\nHe (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) wore both patterned and plain Khamisahs (woollen cloaks).\nHe (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) wore black garments.\nHe (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) wore a fur coat (made from animal pelt) edged with silk brocade\nImam Ahmad and Abu Dawud narrated with their chain of narrators from Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) that the ruler of Byzantium sent the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) a gift of a fur coat edged with fine silk, and he put it on.\nAs-Asma`i (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This refers to a fur coat with long sleeves. Al-Khattabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is likely that this fur coat was edged with silk brocade, because the fur coat itself cannot be made of silk brocade.\nHe (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) bought a pair of trousers, and what appears to be the case is that he only bought them in order to wear them. It is narrated in more than one Hadith that he wore trousers and they (the Companions) wore trousers with his permission.\nHe wore Khuffayn (leather slippers that come above the ankles) and he wore sandals that were called Tasumah.\nHe (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) wore rings; the Hadiths differ as to whether he wore his ring on his right hand or his left hand. All of the Hadiths have authentic chains of narration.\nHe wore a helmet, and he wore chainmail. On the day of Uhud he appeared wearing two garments of chainmail.\nMuslim narrated that Asma’ bint Abi Bakr (may Allah be pleased with her) said: This is the Jubbah (overgarment) of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and she brought out to me a Persian overgarment which had pockets lined with silk brocade and its sleeves were edged with silk brocade. She said: This was in `Aishah’s possession until she died, and when she died, I took it. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to wear it, and now we wash it for the sick and seek healing thereby.\nHe (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) had two green garments [Burdah – the Burdah is a striped garment that is open at the front. It is usually placed on the shoulders like an `Abayah but it is smaller. The wearer wraps himself up in it or lets it hang down; it is similar to the kisa’ (a mantle or wrap)]. He also had a black mantle, a felted red mantle, and a mantle made of goat hair.\nHis Qamis (chemise) was made of cotton; it was short and had short sleeves. As for these wide and long sleeves like saddlebags, neither he nor any of his companions wore such things at all, and that is contrary to his Sunnah; there is some doubt as to its permissibility, because it is akin to showing off.\nThe most beloved garment to him was the Qamis (chemise – thobe or Galabiyah) and Hibarah (a striped garment) – the Hibarah is a type of Burdah with some reddish colour.\nThe most beloved of colours to him was white, and he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “They (white garments) are the best of your garments, so wear them and shroud your dead in them.\nAl-Bukhari narrated from `A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that she brought out a felted Kisa’ (mantle) and an Izar made of heavy fabric and said: The soul of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was taken whilst he was wearing these.\nWith regard to the Taylasan (shawl) [which is a cover that is worn over the head and shoulders, or over the shoulders only, and is worn nowadays by many priests and Jewish rabbis – see Al-Mu`jam Al-Wasit (2/553)], there is no report to suggest that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) or any of his companions wore it. Rather it is proven in Muslim, in the Hadith of Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him), that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) mentioned the Dajjal and said: “He will emerge, accompanied by seventy thousand of the Jews of Asbahan, wearing Taylasans (shawls).” Anas saw a group of people wearing such shawls and said: How closely they resemble the Jews of Khaybar. Therefore a number of the earlier and later scholars regarded it as disliked to wear it.\nMost of the garments that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his companions wore were made of cotton, and sometimes they wore garments made of wool or linen. Shaykh Abu Is-haq Al-Asbahani (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated with an authentic chain of narration from Jabir ibn Ayyub that he said: As-Salt ibn Rashid entered upon Muhammad ibn Sirin wearing a Jubbah of wool, an Izar of wool and a turban of wool. Muhammad got upset with him and said: I think that some people wear wool and say that `Isa ibn Maryam wore it. But someone whose sincerity I do not doubt told me that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) wore linen, wool and cotton, and the Sunnah of our Prophet is more deserving of being followed.\nWhat Ibn Sirin (may Allah have mercy on him) meant by saying this is that some people think that wearing wool all the time is better than wearing other fabrics, so they make sure to wear it and they forbid themselves to wear anything else. Similarly, they strive to wear only one style of clothing, and they think that doing anything else is wrong. But what is wrong is restricting oneself to such a thing, adhering to it and never doing anything different.\nThe correct view is that the best path is the path of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that he followed, enjoined, encouraged and did all the time. His practice with regard to clothing was to wear whatever was easily available, sometimes wool, sometimes cotton, sometimes linen; he wore a Yemeni Burd (cloak) and a green Burd; he wore a Jubbah, Qaba’ (over-garment), Qamis (chemise or thobe/Galabiyah), trousers, Izar, Rida’, Khuff (leather slippers), and sandals; he let the end of his turban hang down from behind sometimes, and at other times he did not do that, and sometimes he brought part of the turban under his chin. When he bought a new garment he would mention it by name and say: “O Allah, You have given me this chemise/Rida’/turban to wear; I ask You for its goodness and the goodness for which it was made, and I seek refuge with You from its evil and the evil for which it was made.” And when he put on his chemise, he would start on the right.\nHe wore black goat hair, as Muslim narrated from `A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that she said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) went out wearing a striped garment made of black hair. It is narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim from Qatadah: We said to Anas: Which garments were most liked by the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)? He said: The Hibarah. The Hibarah was a Yemeni cloak. Most of their garments were made of Yemeni textiles, because Yemen was close to them. They sometimes wore things that were imported from greater Syria and Egypt, such as Qibati fabric which was woven from linen by the Copts (Egyptians).\nIn Sahih An-Nasa’i, it is narrated from `A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that she made for the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) a Burdah (cloak) of wool and he put it on, but when he sweated he noticed the smell of the wool, and he took it off, as he liked good smells. In Sunan Abu Dawud, it is narrated that `Abdullah ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I saw the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) wearing one of the best suits.\nIn Sunan An-Nasa’i, it is narrated that Abu Rimthah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I saw the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) delivering a speech wearing two green garments.\nThe green garment is a garment that has green stripes; it is exactly like the red Hullah (suit). Whoever thinks that the red Hullah was pure red should also say that the green garment was pure green, but no one says that.

163168,"When I met my husband, before we got married, we were both Muslim, but we (I seek Allah’s forgiveness for that) apostatised from Islam shortly after we met. Then we got married according to British law, and we had a wedding party that was not Islamic (as we were not Muslims at that time). Two years after that, my husband embraced Islam again, but I remained a disbeliever for a few months following that. Then finally I became Muslim again, praise be to Allah, and now we are in the best shape. My question now is: is our marriage valid? If it is not, then what must we do? Please note that everyone around us knows that we are married and that we had a non-Islamic wedding that was attended by people from near and far. But the problem is, as I noted above, that we were not Muslims, and our marriage was according to British law, not according to Islamic sharia.","['Praise be to Allah.If two apostates become Muslim together, then their marriage is recognised, as is the case when two disbelievers who had never been Muslim previously become Muslim. This has been explained previously in the answer to question no. 118752.\nIf one of the spouses becomes Muslim, and the other delays becoming Muslim until the woman’s ‘iddah has ended, then a new marriage contract must be done, according to most of the scholars.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If one of the spouses becomes Muslim, and the other delays becoming Muslim until the woman’s ‘iddah has ended, the marriage is dissolved according to the view of the majority of scholars. Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said: The scholars did not differ regarding that, except for something narrated from an-Nakha‘i, in which he differed from the majority of scholars and no one followed him in that. He claimed that the woman could go back to her husband, even after a long time, because of the report narrated by Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) sent Zaynab back to her husband Abu’l-‘As on the basis of their first marriage contract. This report was narrated by Abu Dawud and cited as evidence by Ahmad. It was said to him: Did he not narrate that he sent her to him on the basis of a new marriage contract? He said: There is no basis for that. And it was said that between the time when she became Muslim and the time when he sent her back to him eight years passed. (End quote from al-Mughni, 7/188).\nSome scholars favoured the view that the marriage is not dissolved, even if the woman’s ‘iddah has ended. Therefore if both spouses want to go back to one another after the ‘iddah has ended, they may do so, and there is no need to do a new marriage contract.\nThis view was favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah and his student Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on them). Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin also regarded it as more likely to be correct (may Allah have mercy on him).\nThey quoted as evidence for that the hadith of Abu’l -‘As referred to above, and the fact that there is no report in the Sunnah to suggest that the matter is connected to the end of the woman’s ‘iddah.\nSee: ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘ (12/245-248).\nBased on this view, your previous marriage contract remains valid and there is no need to do a new marriage contract.\nWe ask Allah to guide you and enable you to do all that is good.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/163168/they-apostatised-and-got-married-then-the-husband-became-muslim-before-her-do-they-need-to-do-a-new-marriage-contract
427817,When were Surat Al-Falaq and Surat An-Nas revealed? Is the Hadith about the eleven knots which were tied to bewitch the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) Sahih?,"['Praise be to Allah.The Hadiths indicate that the Mu`awwidhatayn (Al-Falaq and An-Nas) were revealed in Madinah.\nThis is mentioned in the Hadith of `Uqbah ibn `Amir (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Do you not see verses that have been revealed tonight, the like of which has never been seen? {Say, “I seek refuge in the Lord of daybreak} [Al-Falaq 113; interpretation of the meaning] and {Say, “I seek refuge in the Lord of mankind} [An-Nas 114; interpretation of the meaning].”\n`Uqbah ibn `Amir (may Allah be pleased with him) accompanied the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in Madinah, and these two Surahs were revealed after the bewitching incident.\n`Abd ibn Humayd (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated in\xa0Al-Muntakhab\xa0(1/228): Ahmad ibn Yunus told me: Abu Mu`awiyah told us, from Al-A`mash, from Yazid ibn Hayyan, from Zayd ibn Arqam (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: A Jewish man bewitched the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and he fell sick. Jibril came to him, bringing down Al-Mu`awwidhatayn, and said: A Jewish man has bewitched you, and the item used for witchcraft is in the well of So-and-so. So he sent `Ali, who brought it to him, then he instructed him to untie the knots and recite verses, so he started reciting and untying, until the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) got up as if he had been released from restraints. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not say anything to that Jewish man about what he had done to him, and he never confronted him with it.\nThe narrators of this chain of narration are trustworthy; it was classed as authentic by the commentators on the book, and by Shaykh Al-Albani in\xa0As-Silsilah As-Sahihah (6/617)\nAl-Hafidh Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nHe said: Because of that, Al-Mu`awidhatayn were revealed.
