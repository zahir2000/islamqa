He said: ""Count six signs that indicate the approach of the Hour: my death; the conquest of Jerusalem; a plague that will afflict you (and kill you in great numbers) as the plague that afflicts sheep; the increase of money to such an extent that even if one is given one hundred dinars, he will not be satisfied; an affliction which no Arab house will escape; and a truce between you and Banu al-Asfar, who will betray you and march on you under eighty flags. Under each flag will be twelve thousand soldiers.""\nAnd his saying: ""mawtan"" means a death that occurs frequently.\nIt appears that this severe death will occur among people due to the trials that happen in the last days.\nAlso in Musnad (16964) from the Hadith of Salamah ibn Nufayl As-Sakuni (may Allah be pleased with him), the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said in a Hadith about the conditions of the last days: ""And you will come in groups, some of you will destroy others, and before the Hour there will be a severe death, and after it years of earthquakes."" The Hadith has an authentic chain of transmission, as mentioned by the researchers of the Resalah edition.\nAnd from Abu Hurairah: The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: ""The Hour will not come until knowledge is taken away, earthquakes increase, time passes quickly, trials appear, and there will be much Harj - and it is killing, killing - until wealth among you will become abundant and overflow.""

111127,"When the marriage contract was done, all the conditions were met of having two witnesses and the wali (guardian), but when the marriage contract was completed, the following happened: My hand was put in the hand of the bride’s guardian, but he read the wording of the marriage contract from a piece of paper, namely “Zawwajtuka… (I give to you in marriage…)”, And he mentioned her name but he did not mention the Mahr. I replied to him with the word “Qabiltu (I accept)”, but after that I agreed with the bride on a very small amount of money. Is what happened valid and is the marriage contract valid or not?","['Praise be to Allah.Is marriage valid without Mahr (dowry)?\nIf the marriage contract was done without any mention of the Mahr , the marriage contract is valid and the wife is entitled to a Mahr like that of her peers.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Mughni (7/182):\xa0\n“Marriage is valid without stating the dowry according to the opinion of most of the scholars. That is indicated by the verse in which Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “There is no sin on you, if you divorce women while yet you have not touched (had sexual relation with) them, nor appointed unto them their Mahr (bridal money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage)” [Al-Baqarah 2:236].\xa0\nIt was narrated that Ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) was asked about a man who married a woman but did not state what her dowry would be (did not “appoint unto her a Mahr”), and he did not consummate the marriage with her before he died. Ibn Mas‘ood said: She is entitled to a dowry like that of her peers, without exaggeration or falling short, she has to observe the ‘iddah and she is entitled to inheritance. Ma`qil ibn Sinan Al-Ashja`i stood up and said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) issued a verdict concerning Birwa‘ bint Washiq, one of our womenfolk, that was similar to your verdict.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi, he said: this is an authentic Hadith.”\xa0\nTypes of marriage without stating the Mahr\xa0\nMarriage without stating the Mahr is of two types.\xa0\n\nThe first is that in which the Mahr is not mentioned at all, and the man gives his daughter in marriage without any Mahr, so he says: I give you my daughter in marriage, and the suitor says: I accept – without mentioning any Mahr, as happened in your case.\nThe second type is that in which the Mahr is mentioned without specifying its amount, such as if the suitor says to the guardian: I will give you what you want of the Mahr, or the guardian says to the suitor: Give whatever you see fit, and so on.\n\nThe wife is to be given a Mahr like that of her peers in both cases.\nWho decides the Mahr of a woman’s peers?\nThe Mahr of her peers is to be defined by the judge, so as to avoid conflict. But if they agree on something without referring to the judge, there is nothing wrong with that, because they have the right to do so.\nIt says in Zad Al-Mustaqni`: “It is valid to do the marriage contract without mentioning the Mahr or mentioning it without specifying it. The wife is entitled to a Mahr like that of her peers by virtue of the marriage contract, and the amount is to be specified by the judge. If they agree upon something before that, that is permissible.”\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The words “If they agree upon something before that, that is permissible” mean: if they agree on it without referring to the judge, they have the right to do that. In other words, there is nothing wrong with that. So if they say: Why should we go to the qadi? Let us agree on something between ourselves, and the husband offers a Mahr of one thousand, and she asks for two thousand, and some people intervene and suggest one thousand five hundred, and so on, there is nothing wrong with that, because they have the right to any agreement they reach.” (Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti`, 12/315)\nThus you will see that the marriage contract is valid and that the Mahr on which you have agreed is also valid, if the wife is mature and of sound mind.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/111127/is-marriage-valid-without-mahr
67934,"In order for a person to be allowed to sit during the obligatory prayers, is it essential that he should be completely unable to stand? Or is it also permissible for a person who is able to stand, but it is possible that it may lead to harm? What is the definition of the inability that makes it permissible to sit during the prayer and not stand, without that incurring sin or punishment?","[""Praise be to Allah.Can you pray sitting down in obligatory prayer?\nStanding during prayer is an obligatory pillar which cannot be omitted. It is not permissible for anyone to pray sitting unless he is unable to stand, or standing is very difficult for him, or he is sick and there is the fear that his sickness may become worse if he prays standing up.\xa0\nThat also includes a paralyzed person who is unable to stand at all, and an elderly person for whom it is difficult to stand, and a sick person who will be harmed by standing because it will either make his sickness worse or delay his recovery.\xa0\nThe basic principle concerning that is the report narrated by Al-Bukhari (1050) from `Imran ibn Husayn (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: I had haemorrhoids, and I asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about praying. He said: “Pray standing; if you cannot, then sitting; and if you cannot, then lying on your side.”\xa0\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“If standing will make a sick person’s sickness worse, then he should pray sitting. The scholars unanimously agreed that a person who cannot stand may pray sitting. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to `Imran ibn Husayn: “Pray standing; if you cannot, then sitting; and if you cannot, then lying on your side.”\xa0\nIt was also narrated by Al-Bukhari, Abu Dawud and An-Nasa’i (may Allah have mercy on them), who added: “If you cannot, then lying on your back, and Allah does not burden any soul beyond its scope.”\n\xa0Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) fell from a horse and was injured on his right side. We entered upon him to visit him and the time for prayer came. He prayed sitting and we prayed sitting behind him. (Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim)\xa0\nIf he is able to stand but he fears that his sickness will be made worse, or that his recovery may be delayed, or it is too hard for him to stand, then he may pray sitting down. Something similar was said by Malik and Is-haq (may Allah have mercy on them). Maymun ibn Mahran (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If he is unable to stand for any worldly purpose, then let him pray sitting. Something similar was narrated from Ahmad.\ni.e., if he is able to stand for some worldly purpose then he must also pray standing and it is not permissible for him to pray sitting. \xa0\nThen Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: But Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “[He] has not laid upon you in religion any hardship” [Al-Hajj 22:78]. Obliging a person to stand in this case is hardship. And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sat when he had been injured on his right side, although it appears that he was not completely unable to stand, but because of the difficulty involved in standing, this requirement was waived for him, and is waived for others too… If a person is able to stand by leaning on a stick or on the wall, or leaning on someone who is next to him, then he should do that, because he is able to stand without it causing him harm, so he must do it, just as he should if he is able to do it without these things.”\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“The scholars of the Ummah unanimously agreed that whoever is unable to stand in an obligatory prayer may pray sitting , and he does not have to repeat it. Our companions said: That does not detract from the reward that he would earn if he prayed standing, because he is excused. It is proven in Sahih Al-Bukhari that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If a person is sick or is travelling, there is written for him (the reward) for the deeds he used to do when he was healthy or not travelling.” Our companions said:\xa0 For a person to be allowed to pray sitting down , it is not a condition that he should be completely unable to stand, and it is not enough if he finds it a little difficult; rather what counts is evident hardship. If he fears that it will be extremely difficult or it will make his sickness worse , etc, or a person who is travelling by boat fears that he may drown or become dizzy, then he may pray sitting, and he does not have to repeat it.”(Al-Majmu`, 4/201)\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) explained the definition of the hardship which makes it permissible for a person not to stand in an obligatory prayer, and how to sit. He said: The definition of difficulty is that which takes away Khushu ` (proper focus and humility). Khushu` means that the heart is focused and at peace. If it is the case that standing will make a person severely anxious and have no peace of mind, and he is longing to get to the end of Al-Fatihah so that he can bow because he is finding it too hard to stand, then it is too difficult for him to pray standing, so he should pray sitting.\xa0\nThe same applies to one who is afraid and cannot pray standing, such as if he is praying behind a wall, and there are enemies around watching out for him, and if he stands they will be able to see him from behind the wall, but if he sits he will be hidden from his enemies. In this case we say to him: Pray sitting.\xa0\nThis is indicated by the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And if you fear (an enemy), perform prayer on foot or riding” [Al-Baqarah 2:239]\nAllah has exempted the one who is afraid from bowing, prostrating and sitting, and the same applies to standing if he is afraid.\xa0\nBut how should he sit?\xa0\nHe should sit Mutarabbi`an on his buttocks, with each calf tucked up to the thigh. This is called tarabbu’, and in this posture the calf and thigh on the right and the left are all visible, whereas in the case of Iftirash the calf disappears beneath the thigh, but in tarabbu’ all four parts (thigh and calf on both sides) are visible.\xa0\nIs it obligatory to sit like this?\xa0\nNo, it is Sunnah. If a person prays Muftarishan (in the posture called Iftirash) there is nothing wrong with it, and if he prays Muhtabiyan (sitting with one’s legs drawn up and wrapped in one's garment) there is nothing wrong with it, because of the general meaning of the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “If he cannot, then sitting.” He did not explain how he is to sit. \xa0\nIf a person says, Is there any evidence to suggest that he should pray Mutarabbi`an? The answer is yes. `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: I saw the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) praying mutarabbi’an. And because that is usually more comfortable than Al-Iftirash. It is well known that standing needs a longer recitation than saying, “Rabb ighfir li warhamni (Lord forgive me and have mercy on me).” Hence it is better to sit mutarabbi’an. And there is another benefit, which is differentiating between sitting instead of standing, and sitting when one is supposed to sit; if we say that a person should sit Muftarishan during the time of standing, there would be no difference between the way of sitting when one is supposed to and the way of sitting when it is done instead of standing. \xa0\nIf that is at the time of bowing, some of them say that it should be Muftarishan but the correct view is that it should be mutarabbi’an, because when bowing a person’s leg and thigh are upright, and he only bends his back. So we say that if a person is mutarabbi’an he should remain like that and bow in that posture. This is the correct view concerning this matter.” (Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti`, 4/461)\xa0\nCan you pray sitting down in Sunnah prayers?\nWith regard to optional prayers, it is permissible to sit during them with no excuse, according to scholarly consensus, but the reward of the one who sits in that case is half the reward of one who stands, because of the report narrated by Muslim from `Abdullah ibn `Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: I was told that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The prayer of a man who sits is half of the prayer of a man who stands.” I came to him and found him praying sitting. I put my hand on his head and he said, ‘What is the matter, O `Abdullah ibn `Amr?” I said, “I was told, O Messenger of Allah, that you said, ‘The prayer of a man who sits is half of the prayer of a man who stands,’ and you are praying sitting.” He said, “Yes, but I am not like one of you.”\xa0\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Sharh Muslim: What this means is that the prayer of one who sits brings half the reward of the prayer of one who stands, which means that it is valid but brings a lesser reward. This Hadith is to be understood as referring to an optional prayer offered sitting when one is able to stand. This brings half the reward of a prayer offered standing. But if a person offers an optional prayer sitting down because he is unable to stand, then the reward is not reduced, rather it will be the same as one who stands. With regard to obligatory prayers, if a person prays sitting down when he is able to stand, his prayer is not valid and he will not be rewarded, rather he is sinning.\xa0\nOur companions (the Shafi`is) said: If he believes that to be permissible, he is a disbeliever and is subject to the rulings on apostates, just like one who regards Zina (adultery/fornication), Riba and other prohibited things to be permissible.\n\xa0If a person offers an obligatory prayer sitting down because he is unable to stand, or lying down because he is unable to stand or sit, then his reward will be like that of one who stands, and it will not be reduced, according to the consensus of our companions. The Hadith about the reduction in reward is to be understood as applying to one who offers an optional prayer sitting when he is able to stand. This differentiation is our view and is the view of the majority concerning the meaning of this Hadith. \xa0\nAnd he said: With regard to the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “I am not like any one of you,” according to our companions it is one of the unique characteristics of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that his optional prayers offered sitting when he was able to stand were like his optional prayers offered standing, as an honour for him, as he was also singled out for other honours that are well known in the books of our companions and others. We have discussed them in the beginning of Tahdhib Al-Asma’ wal-Lughat. (Sharh Sahih Muslim, 6/14)\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/67934/can-you-pray-sitting-down
432487,"what works against us when we are in some beneficial worldly pursuit like education, exercise, business etc (because most people are undisciplined)? In psychology, it's called 'Resistance'. They use the word for a force that works against us, when doing anything difficult in the short term but beneficial in the long term.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nPersonal discipline in goals, whether worldly or religious, is the essence of effectiveness and achievement. Personal discipline can be defined as the ability to do what you must do, when you must do it, whether you feel the desire and motivation to do it or not.\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: ""A strong believer is better and dearer to Allah than a weak believer, and there is good in both. Adhere to whatever brings you benefit, seek the help of Allah, and do not feel helpless. If something befalls you, do not say: \'Had I done such-and-such, it would be such-and-such.\' Indeed,\'if\' opens the way before the devil to act."" Reported by Muslim (2664), from the narration of Abu Hurairah (may Allah be pleased with him).\nThe Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) used to seek refuge in Allah from incapacity and laziness. Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) would say: ""O Allah, I seek refuge with You from incapacity, laziness, cowardice, senility, and miserliness. And I seek refuge with You from the torment of the grave. And I seek refuge with You from the trials of life and death."" Reported by Al-Bukhari (2823) and Muslim (2706).\nIncapacity is a person\'s failure to do what they should do, thinking they are unable to do it, while laziness is a person\'s failure to do what they must do, despite knowing they are capable of doing it.\nBoth of these traits are the opposite of self-discipline, and the final result is a decrease in a person\'s effectiveness and inability to achieve their goals and fulfill their responsibilities.\nSecondly:\nThe reasons that prevent a person from self-discipline and hinder them from performing their tasks are varied, and some of them can be mentioned as follows:\n(1) The absence of a network of sequential procedures made up of small parts that lead us to the goal. Consider Salah, for example. Allah did not simply say, ""Pray,"" but He legislated a network of procedures distributed over times, supported by collective action, which ultimately leads us to achieve this goal. You will find small preparatory steps before each Salah, such as the alerting call to prayer, then purification, and walking calmly to the prayer, and so on.\nThe idea of small steps is important in the Shari`ah. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: ""The most beloved deed to Allah is the one that is consistent, even if it is small."" Reported by Muslim (782). \'Aishah said about the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him): ""His deeds were consistent."" Reported by Al-Bukhari (1987).\nSimilarly, there is the gradual legislation of fasting and the gradual prohibition of alcohol. Always gradual steps, taking into account the conditions of the people, what they can bear, and what is best for their affairs.\n(2) The absence of final deadlines for accomplishment. Consider Salah again, and how each prayer has a beginning and an end time, as does fasting.\n(3) The desire for perfection and doing something perfectly, or not doing it at all. This desire ultimately results in not doing it at all. The revelation invalidates this idea, as Allah says (translation of the meaning): {So fear Allah as much as you are able}\xa0(At-Taghabun 64:16), and the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: ""Let one of you pray with vigor, and if he becomes weary, let him sit down."" Reported by Al-Bukhari (1150) and Muslim (784).\n(4) Lack of clarity in daily tasks or excessive daily tasks. Focus should be on two or three goals that have a significant impact on your most important project. Once you have completed them, move on to a subsidiary list, where you have recorded a number of other tasks related to your major project or others. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: ""O people, take on the deeds that you can handle; for Allah does not tire until you tire. And the most beloved deeds to Allah are those that are consistent, even if they are small. The family of Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) would establish a deed and adhere to it."" Reported by Al-Bukhari (1151) and Muslim (782).\n(5) Working on several large projects at the same time and being scattered among them.\n(6) Starting a large task without sufficient preparation, or without possessing appropriate skills, or without having the right tools.\n(7) Excessive involvement in social activities and time-wasting activities.\n(8) Neglecting times for personal entertainment and enjoyment.\n(9) Neglecting to draw on the experiences of others, or their efforts, and completely turning away from collective work where it is required and needed.\n(10) Not understanding the emotions that hinder achievement and not being able to deal with them.\nThirdly:\nThe basic skills that self-discipline is a part of are called ""executive skills,"" and here we recommend a book titled ""Smart but Scattered,"" which we hope will help you more precisely identify the problems and ways to address them.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/432487/reasons-for-lack-of-discipline-in-beneficial-pursuits
