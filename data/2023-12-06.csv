146916,"What is the ruling if I enter the mosque when I am travelling, and I find a group of people praying other than the congregational prayer of the mosque for which the adhan and iqamah were given? Do I have to pray with them, and offer the prayer in full when they do so? Or should I pray on my own and shorten my prayer, on the basis that this is not the original congregational prayer? Is it valid for there to be two congregations or groups praying in one mosque at the same time?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nPrayer in congregation is not waived for the traveller, so if he hears the call to prayer, he must answer it, unless he has an excuse. This has been explained previously in the answer to question no. 40299 .\nSecondly:\nIf someone misses the first congregational prayer because of an excuse, then he enters the mosque and finds some people praying, then in his case it is prescribed for him to join them in the prayer.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf group of people missed the congregational prayer by accident, not deliberately, it is recommended for them to offer the prayer in congregation and not pray individually.""(Nur ‘ala al-Darb\xa0183/11).\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe second congregation is prescribed, and it may be obligatory, because of the general meaning of the evidence, if a person missed praying with the first congregation.

10547,"I have a strange question. My Aqeedah is that after the body is dead, it is of no use and they cannot hear, but according to a Hadith, there is punishment in the grave. Does this mean that the body is still alive? Also in the quran it is mentioned that martyrs don't die? It is reported in a Hadith in Sahih Muslim that when the Prophet (sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam) addressed the body of Abu Jahl, Imayyah and others, ‘Umar asked him how the dead could hear, to which the Prophet replied that they can hear but cannot reply. Kindly answer my question with detail.","[""Praise be to Allah.Do dead people hear us?\nWhat is mentioned in the question, that the dead do not hear anything which the living say is true and is correct. Allah says (interpretation of the meanings):\xa0\n“but you cannot make hear those who are in graves. ”\xa0[Fatir 35:22]\xa0\n“So verily, you (O Muhammad) cannot make the dead to hear.”\xa0[Ar-Rum 30:52]\nIs there torment and punishment in the grave?\n\xa0The belief of Ahl As-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah is that there is torment and punishment in the grave and life in Al-barzakh (the interval between death and the Day of Resurrection), and there is blessing and pleasure, according to the status of the deceased.\xa0\nThe evidence for that is the verse (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“The Fire, they are exposed to it, morning and afternoon. And on the Day when the Hour will be established (it will be said to the angels): ‘Cause Pharaoh’s people to enter the severest torment!’”[Ghafir 40:46]\xa0\nAllah states here that the people of Pharaoh are exposed to torment morning and afternoon even though they are dead. From this verse, the scholars affirmed that the torment of the grave is real.\xa0\nIbn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“This verse is the main basis of the belief of Ahl As-Sunnah in the torment of Al-barzakh , as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“The Fire, they are exposed to it, morning and afternoon” [Ghaafir 40:46].”\xa0(Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 4/82)\xa0\nAccording to the Hadith of `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her), the wife of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to supplicate in his prayer, “Allahumma inni a`udhu bika min `adhab il-qabr, wa a`udhu bika min fitnat il-masih id-dajjal, wa a`udhu bika min fitnat il-mahya wa fitnat il-mamat, Allahumma ini a`udhu bika min Al-ma’tham wal-maghram (O Allah, I seek refuge in You from the torment of the grave, I seek refuge in You from the tribulation of the Dajjal, I seek refuge in You from the trials of life and death, O Allah, I seek refuge in You from sin and loss).”\xa0(Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 798; Muslim, 589)\xa0\nThe relevant point in this Hadith is that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to seek refuge with Allah from the torment of the grave. This is one of the proofs that confirm the torment of the grave. No one disputed the torment of the grave apart from the Mu`tazilah and some other groups who are not worth paying attention to.\xa0\nInterpreting Prophet Muhammad's Address to the Deceased Polytheists at the Battle of Badr\nWith regard to the Hadith which describes the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) addressing the dead bodies of the polytheists on the day of the battle of Badr, this was a unique case where Allah brought them back to life so that His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) might rebuke them and humiliate them.\n\nIt was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stood over the well of Badr [into which the bodies of the polytheists had been thrown] and said, ‘Have you found the promise of your Lord to be true?’ Then he said, ‘They can hear what I am saying now.’”\xa0(Narrated by Al-Bukhaari, 3980; Muslim, 932)\xa0\nIt was narrated that Abu Talhah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “ ‘Umar said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, why are you speaking to bodies that have no souls?’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘By the One in Whose hand is the soul of Muhammad, you do not hear what I am saying any better than they do.’” Qutadah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Allah brought them back to life so that they could hear what he was saying, so that they might be rebuked and feel regret and shame.\xa0(Narrated by Al-Bukhaari, 3976; Muslim, 2875. See Fath Al-Baari, 7/304)\xa0\n\nThe relevant point here is that Allah caused the people in the well to hear the words of His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), so that they might be humiliated. Nonetheless, it is not correct to deduce from this Hadith that the dead can hear everything, because this applied only to the people in the well. Some scholars made an exception and said that the dead can hear the greeting of Salam, but this is a view for which clear sound evidence is lacking.\nDoes the torment of the grave befall both the soul and the body?\nAccording to the most correct scholarly view, the torment of the grave befalls both the soul and the body .\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“The view of the earliest generations of this Ummah and its Imams is that the torment or blessing (of the grave) happens to the soul of the deceased and his body. After it departs from the body, the soul continues to be blessed or punished, and it is also connected to the body from time to time, so that the blessing or torment befalls the body as well as the soul.\xa0Therefore, we must believe in that which Allah has told us.”\xa0(Al-Ikhtiyarat Al-Fiqhiyyah, p. 94)\xa0\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Shaykh Al-Islam (Ibn Taymiyah) was asked about this matter, and we will quote his reply in full:\xa0\n“Indeed, the torment and blessing happen to both the soul and the body, according to the consensus of the Ahl As-Sunnah wal-Jama’ah. The soul is blessed or tormented separately from the body, and it is blessed or tormented in connection with the body. The body is connected to it, so in this case the blessing or torment happens to them both, and it may happen to the soul separately from the body.\xa0\nThe view of the Salaf and Imams of this Ummah is that when a person dies, he will be in a state of blessing or torment, and that happens to his soul and his body. After the soul has departed from the body, it remains in a state of blessing or torment, and that is sometimes connected to the body and the blessing or torment happens to them both. Then when the Day of Resurrection comes, the souls will be returned to their bodies and they will rise from their graves to meet the Lord of the Worlds. The physical resurrection is a matter upon which the Muslims, Jews and Christians are agreed.”\xa0\xa0(Al-Ruh, p. 51, 52)\xa0\nThe scholars likened that to dreams when one is asleep, for a person may dream that he is going and traveling, and he may feel happiness or grief and sorrow while he is sleeping, and that is when he is in his place and in this world. So it is more apt that things should be different in the life of Al-barzakh which is completely different from the life of this world and the life of the Hereafter.\xa0\nAl-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“If it is said, we see the deceased and how he is in his grave, so how can he be questioned, made to sit up and beaten with iron rods, when no mark is left on him? The answer is that this is not impossible, and indeed there is a similar case in our regular lives, that of the sleeper who feels joy or pain of which we feel nothing.\xa0 A person who is awake may also feel joy or pain because of something he hears or thinks about, and those who are sitting with him feel nothing of that. Similarly, Jibril used to come to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and tell him of the Revelation, and the people present were unaware of it. All of that is clear and evident.”\xa0(Sharh Muslim, 17/201)\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“When a person sleeps, he may feel joy or pain, and that happens to his soul and his body. He may dream that someone is beating him and wake up with pain in his body, or he may dream that he is being fed some good food, then wake up with the taste of food in his mouth. This is something that really happens. If the body and soul of a sleeping person can experience joy and pain that are not felt by the person next to him, and a sleeper may even cry out because of the intensity of pain or fear of what is happening to him, and those who are awake can hear him, and he may speak, reciting Quran or dhikr, or talking to someone, and those who are awake can hear that, even though he is asleep with his eyes closed, and he does not hear them if they speak to him – then how can we deny that the one who is buried in his grave also feels things, when the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) has told us that he “hears the sound of their footsteps” and “You do not hear what I say any better than they do”?\xa0\nThe heart is akin to the grave, hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, when he missed ‘Asr on the day of Al-Khandaq: “May Allah fill their hearts and graves with fire.” Moreover, Allah differentiated between them (graves and hearts) in the verse (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Knows he not that when the contents of the graves are poured forth (all mankind is resurrected)?\nAnd that which is in the hearts (of men) shall be made known?”\xa0[Al-‘Aadiyat 100:9-10]\nThis is just to explain that this could happen.\nWe cannot say that the blessing or torment that the dead experience is like that which a sleeper experiences when he dreams, rather that blessing or torment is more complete and more far-reaching; it is a real blessing and a real torment. Yet, this example is given to show that this is possible. If someone were to say that the dead person does not move in his grave, and the soil does not change, and so on, this matter may be explained in more detail, but that would take too long to explain here. And Allah knows best. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.”\xa0(Majmu’ Al-Fatawa, 4/275, 276)\xa0\nFor more details, please see this category: Torment and Blessing in the Grave\nAnd Allah knows best""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10547/torment-and-blessing-in-the-grave
246484,"There is someone who embraced Islam and was Christian before. As for me, I was an atheist. Will those people attain the twofold reward because they were previously People of the Book? I ask Allah to bless them. All it is, is that I feel sad because I had to go through a lot of anguish before I came to know Allah, may He be blessed and exalted.","['Praise be to Allah.Al-Bukhari (3011) and Muslim (154) narrated from Abu Musa that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There are three who will be given a double reward: a man who has a slave woman whom he taught and taught her well, and he taught her manners and taught her well, then he set her free and married her – he will have a double reward; a believer from among the People of the Book, he was a believer, then he believed in the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) – he will have a double reward; and a slave who fulfils his duty towards Allah and is sincere towards his master.”\nWhoever believes in his Prophet then believes in Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) will have a twofold reward, one for believing in his Prophet (peace be upon him) and one for believing in our Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). This is in accordance with the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Those to whom We gave the scripture before are the ones who believe in it [the Quran].\nWhen it is recited to them, they say: We believe in it, for it is indeed the truth from our Lord. Verily, we had already submitted [to Allah, in Islam] before that.\nSuch people will be given a twofold reward for their patience and steadfastness; they repel evil with good, and spend out of that which We have provided for them}\xa0[al-Qasas 28:52-54].\nThis is specifically for those of the People of the Book hwhoe believe in him, so it does not include all disbelievers. al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe hadith applies only to the People of the Book, and it does not include others. Moreover, what we understand from his saying “he believed in his Prophet” is to highlight the great reward; in other words, the reason for the twofold reward is believing in two prophets, and the disbelievers are not like that. It may be said that the difference between the People of the Book and other disbelievers is that the People of the Book recognize Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{those who follow the Messenger, the unlettered Prophet, whom they find mentioned in their own [scriptures], in the Torah and the Gospel}\xa0[al-A‘raf 7:157].\nSo whoever among them believes in him and follows him will have an advantage over others.""(Al-Fath\xa0 1/191).\nThat is supported by the report narrated by Imam Ahmad (22234) from Abu Umamah, who said: I was beside the mount of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on the day of the conquest [of Makkah]. He spoke some pleasing words, and among the things he said was: “Whoever among the People of the two Books becomes Muslim will have a twofold reward, and his rights and duties are the same as ours. Whoever among the polytheists becomes Muslim will have his reward, and his rights and duties are the same as ours.”\nClassed as hasan by al-Albani in al-Sahihah (304).\nThus he differentiated between those of the People of the Book who become Muslim, as he said that they will have a twofold reward, and those of the polytheists who become Muslim, as he did not say that they would have that.\nThe fact that those of the People of the Book who become Muslim will have a twofold reward does not mean that they are better than others in definitive terms. Someone else, who was a polytheist or disbeliever and not one of the People of the Book, may become Muslim and practice Islam well, so he will be given a reward many times greater than that given to one of the People of the Book who becomes Muslim, because of his sound adherence to Islam, the strength of his faith and his righteous deeds. How many of the disbelievers became Muslim and Allah granted victory at their hands and benefitted the people through them, and many people became Muslim at their hands and many nations entered the religion of Islam because of them, such as Abu Bakr and ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with them). They are better and attained greater reward than Salman al-Farisi, ‘Abdullah ibn Salaam and others like them who were previously among the People of the Book –may Allah be pleased with them all.\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nNot everyone who receives a twofold reward is better than others.""(Fath al-Bari by Ibn Rajab 2/232).\nYou have hope, depending on what you do after you become Muslim. If you adhere sincerely to Islam, strive to do righteous deeds and remember that Allah is watching you and what you say and do in private and in public, and you devote yourself to your religion, learn its rulings and teachings, memorize His book and teach that to others, then you will attain of reward what no one knows except Allah, and perhaps you will have many times more reward than someone who attained a twofold reward.\nIf you suffered and went through anguish before, because of disbelief and being with disbelieving people, until Allah blessed you with Islam, then you should acknowledge the blessing that Allah has bestowed on you, give thanks to Him, may He be glorified, for His immense grace, and focus on worshipping and obeying Him. Do not think that what you missed out on of reward means that you cannot attain a better, greater and more generous reward than that. In fact, it is possible to attain that by the grace of Allah, so do not think too much about what you have missed out on of reward, and focus on what you should not miss out on, by doing righteous deeds and fearing Allah.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/246484/is-it-possible-for-someone-who-was-not-a-jew-or-christian-if-he-becomes-muslim-to-attain-multiple-rewards-as-the-former-jew-or-christian-will-attain-a-twofold-reward
125907,"I'm Insha Allah planning to get married soon, and the person of interest to me has come back to me stating the below two hadiths apply to both men & women when choosing their spouses. However I see it differently with men given more options in attributes to look for in a wife.","['Praise be to Allah.Religious commitment is the basis of choosing a spouse\nFirstly we should clarify that Islamic Shari`ah only encourages seeking a righteous wife who is religiously committed, and a righteous husband who is religious and good. Religious commitment is the first and foremost aim, and other characteristics such as beauty, wealth, high position and good lineage and so on are secondary matters. They are not blameworthy in and of themselves, but they are not the basic aims, rather they are complementary qualities. If they are present, then that is ideal, otherwise religious commitment is the basis of all goodness. \xa0\nThis is indicated by what is mentioned in the Sunnah of praise for some of these qualities in the wife . For example, it was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: It was said: O Messenger of Allah, which of women is best? He said: “The one who when he looks at her he is happy and she obeys him when he commands her, and does not go against his wishes with regard to herself or his wealth by doing what he dislikes.”\xa0(Narrated by Ahmad (2/251); classed as hasan by al-Albani in Al-Silsilah Al-Sahihah (1838)\xa0\nThe same applies to the husband. The basic principle is to seek marriage to a righteous, pious man , as described in the hadith in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “with whose religious commitment and good character you are pleased.” If that is accompanied by good looks, wealth and high position, that is a blessing from Allah.\xa0\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) regarded a man’s wasting his money and not being able to spend on his wife as a reason for not getting married to him. That appears in the hadith of Fatimah bint Qays (may Allah be pleased with her) who said: When my\xa0‘iddah ended, I told him – meaning the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) – that Mu’awiyah ibn Abi Sufyan and Abu Jahm had proposed marriage to me. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “As for Abu Jahm, his stick never leaves his shoulder. As for Mu’awiyah, he is very poor and has no wealth. Marry Usamah ibn Zayd.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1480)\xa0\nAl-‘Allamah al-Sa’di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“If there are other (good qualities) as well as religious commitment, that is good, otherwise religious commitment is the greatest of qualities to be sought.” (Bahjat Qulub Al-Abrar wa Qurrat ‘Uyun al-Akhyar fi Sharh Jawami’ al-Akhbar, p. 120)\xa0\nSeeking worldly characteristics in a spouse\nOnce the above is clear, we will know the answer to the question that was asked. We know that wealth, good lineage and good looks are things that are desirable in both spouses in most people’s view, both believers and disbelievers. Wanting these things is something that is natural in human beings. Islam does not object to that, rather they are not pointed out because people – by their nature – pay attention to these matters and seek them; they even exaggerate about that and neglect other important things. So Islam came to confirm what people neglect or ignore, even though this is the most desirable quality according to the standards of Shari`ah. This, also, is what distinguishes the attitude of the righteous believer from the attitude of anyone else.\xa0\nHence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, in the famous hadith:\n“Women may be married for four things : their wealth, their lineage, their beauty and their religious commitment. Choose the one who is religiously-committed, may your hands be rubbed with dust (i.e., may you prosper).” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari (5090), Muslim (1466)\xa0\nImam al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“The correct meaning of this hadith is that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was speaking of what people usually do; they seek these four qualities, and the last of them in their view is the one who is religiously committed, so seek, O you who are guided, the one who is religiously committed.” (Sharh Muslim, 10/51-52)\xa0\nAnd he (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“What that means is that people usually seek these four qualities in a woman, but you should seek the one who is religiously committed.” (Riyadh al-Salihin, p. 454)\xa0\nAl-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“These four qualities are those that are sought when marrying a woman. They are the qualities that men seek in women. So this is speaking of what happens; it is not a command to that effect. The apparent meaning is that it is permissible to seek all of these qualities when marrying, or one of them, but seeking religious commitment is best and most important.” (Al-Mufhim lima ashkala min Talkhis Sahih Muslim, 4/215)\nShaykh Sulayman ibn Mansur Al-‘Ujayli al-Jamal – who is one of the Shafi`i jurists – says:\xa0\nSome of them quoted this hadith as evidence that it is mustahabb for the woman to be beautiful, and al-Zarkashi disagreed with this understanding by saying that quoting it as evidence that she should be beautiful is strange, because this is a statement of what is usual among people, and it is not a command to marry beautiful women. This is a valid objection. Similarly it is not a command to marry the one who is wealthy, beautiful and of good lineage.” (Futuhat al-Wahhab bi Tawdih Sharh Manhaj Al-Tullab Al-Ma’ruf bi Hashiyat Al-Jamal, 4/118)\xa0\nSome scholars are of the view that these qualities are desirable according to Shari`ah, and that it is mustahabb for the suitor to seek them in the woman to whom he proposes, but it is stipulated that religious commitment should be the basis – also – and that none of the other qualities mentioned should supersede it. If there is any conflict, then religious commitment should always take precedence.\xa0\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \xa0\n“It may also be understood from it – i.e., from this hadith – that it is mustahabb for a man of noble descent to marry a woman who is his equal, but if there is a conflict: a woman of noble descent who is not religiously committed, or a religiously committed woman who is not of noble descent, then religious commitment should be given precedence, and so on with all the other characteristics.\xa0\nFrom the word “her beauty” it may be understood that it is mustahabb to marry a beautiful woman, but if there is a conflict: a beautiful woman who is not religiously committed, or a woman who is not beautiful but is religiously committed, yes, if they [the two women] are equal in terms of religious commitment then the beautiful one is better. We may add to this the one who is beautiful in terms of physical appearance and attitude\xa0\xa0 and the one who asks for a low dowry.\xa0\nThe words “Choose the one who is religiously committed” – what this means is that what is fitting for the man who is religiously-committed and decent is that religion should be his focus in all things, especially in matters that will be long-term. So the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) enjoined him to find a woman who is religiously committed, which is the ultimate goal. In the hadith of ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr, which is narrated by Ibn Majah in a marfu’ report [in which there is some weakness] it says: “Do not marry women for their beauty, for perhaps their beauty may lead to their doom. And do not marry them for their wealth, for perhaps their wealth may make them fall into sin; rather marry them for their religious commitment, and a black slave woman who is religiously committed is better.”\xa0 (Fath al-Bari, 9/135-136)\xa0\nMany Shafi`i books quote this hadith as evidence that it is mustahabb to marry a beautiful woman.\xa0\nIt says in Sharh Muntaha Al-Iradat (2/623), which is a Hanbali book: “It is also Sunnah to choose a beautiful woman because of this hadith [meaning the hadith quoted above].”\nThe matter is broad in scope, in sha Allah, so long as the primary goal of both spouses is agreed upon, which is religious commitment, and so long as the other, worldly characteristics are not blameworthy, rather they are praiseworthy.\xa0\nWhy desirable qualities in men for marriage are not mentioned in the hadith\nWith regard to the desirable qualities in men for marriage not being mentioned as they are in the case of women, that is not due to any differentiation between them, rather it is because usually it is the man who looks for a wife and seeks in her the qualities he chooses, and the woman usually thinks of the qualities of the man who proposes to her . So it is more appropriate that the words in the hadith “Women may be married for four things…” should be addressed in terms of what usually happens and is customary, not in terms of the rare exception.\xa0\nMoreover, Shar`i matters are usually addressed to men, and the scholars of Usul Al-Fiqh have stated that whatever is addressed to men is also addressed to women, unless there is evidence to the contrary, but it is not essential for there to be one text for men and another for women with regard to every Shar`i ruling. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Women are the twin halves of men.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (113) and others, classed as sahih by Al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami’.)\xa0\nFor more, please see these answers: 9602 , 101130 , and 10680 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/125907/what-to-look-for-in-a-spouse-in-islam
