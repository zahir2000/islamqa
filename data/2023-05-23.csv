317771,"I would like to ask about Ibn ‘Uthaymin’s final opinion regarding the yellowish and brownish discharge, as he said that they are not part of menses at all. My question is: what did he (may Allah have mercy on him) say about the hadith which speaks of the women sending vessels containing pieces of cloth on which there was yellowish discharge to ‘A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), and her telling them not to be hasty until they saw the white discharge? Does this mean that she (may Allah be pleased with her) thought that it was part of menses? Did he (may Allah have mercy on him) think that this hadith was da‘if (weak), because he did not regard the yellowish and brownish discharge as menses, or did he have other reasons? Is the addition of the words “after the end of menses” in the hadith “we did not regard the yellowish and brownish discharge as being of any significance” a da‘if (weak) addition, indicating that the hadith is general in meaning, in which case we should not regard the yellowish and brownish discharge as being part of menses? Please note that I follow the view of those who regard it as menses if it is connected to menses, but I want to put my mind at rest. Are the scholars unanimously agreed that the end of menses can only be confirmed if there is complete dryness?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nthe view that Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) settled on in this regard is that the yellowish and brownish discharge are not part of menses, even if they immediately precede or follow the bleeding, as was explained previously in the answer to question no. 179069 .\nWith regard to what happens of such discharges during menses and before the end of bleeding, that is regarded as menses, because it is connected to menses.\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked in al-Liqa’ ash-Shahri (73/37): Dear Shaykh, I hope that you can explain this matter, as there is a great deal of talk about it, namely the ruling on the brownish and yellowish discharge that comes out of a woman after the menstrual bleeding stops. When does the woman’s menses end, and is it essential to see the white discharge?\nHe replied: This is a matter concerning which the scholars differed. My final view concerning this issue is that no attention is to be paid to the brownish or yellowish discharge, unless it occurs during the menses. In other words, for example, a woman whose menses usually lasts for five days sees a brownish or yellowish discharge on the third day. In this case, we say that it is part of menses.\nHowever, in the case of a woman who sees a brownish or yellowish discharge before the bleeding begins, no attention is to be paid to this brownish and yellowish discharge.\nAnother woman’s menses ends, and the bleeding ceases, but the yellowish and brownish discharge continues. No attention is to be paid to that. End quote.\nThe view that the yellowish and brownish discharge are not part of menses is the view of Ibn Hazm (may Allah have mercy on him), in contrast to the majority of scholars of the four madhhabs and others regarding that.\nSee: al-Muhalla (266, 267); Mawsu‘at at-Taharah by ad-Dubyaan (6/286).\nSecondly:\nWe have not come across any suggestion that the shaykh (may Allah have mercy on him) regarded as da‘if the phrase “after the end of menses.” Rather he quoted it as evidence in several places, and stated clearly that it was sahih (sound), and it is indeed sahih.\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Whatever comes after the end of menses of brownish or yellowish discharge, or spotting, or moisture, all of that is not menses, so it does not prevent the woman from praying or fasting, and it does not prevent the man from having intercourse with his wife, because it is not menses. Umm ‘Atiyyah said: “We used to regard the yellowish and brownish discharge as being of no significance.” Narrated by al-Bukhari. Abu Dawud added the phrase “after the end of menses,” and its isnad is sahih. End quote from Majmu‘ al-Fatawa (11/281).\nAnd he (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The words of Umm ‘Atiyyah (may Allah be pleased with her): “We used to regard the yellowish and brownish discharge after the end of menses as being of no significance” were narrated by Abu Dawud with a sahih isnad. It was also narrated by al-Bukhari without the phrase “after the end of menses,” but he included it under the heading: Yellowish and brownish discharge at times other than the days of menses.\nIt says in the commentary Fath al-Bari: He refers thereby to reconciling between the hadith of ‘A’ishah quoted above, in which she said “until you see the white discharge” and the hadith of ‘Umm ‘Atiyyah concerning this topic, by understanding the hadith of ‘A’ishah as referring to if she sees the yellowish and brownish discharge during the days of her menses, whereas if that occurs at any other time, then it is to be interpreted according to what Umm ‘Atiyyah said. End quote.\nThe hadith of ‘A’ishah referred to here is that which al-Bukhari narrated as a mu‘allaq majzum report before this chapter, according to which the women used to send [menstrual cloths] to her in vessels. (11/306).\nAfter adopting his final view, the shaykh (may Allah have mercy on him) interpreted the words of Umm ‘Atiyyah “after the end of menses” as referring to the cessation of bleeding. Before that, he thought that what was meant by the end of menses was the white discharge or complete dryness.\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) said: When the bleeding of menses ceases and is followed by yellowish or brownish discharge, that does not mean anything. In other words, the brownish or yellowish discharge after the cessation of bleeding does not mean anything, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And they ask you about menstruation. Say, “It is harm…”}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:222],\nand what is meant by harm is bleeding.\nUmm ‘Atiyyah said: “We used to regard the yellowish and brownish discharge as being of no significance.” This is how it was narrated by al-Bukhari.\nThe report narrated by Abu Dawud says: “after the end of menses”. But the end of menses is when the bleeding ceases.\nBased on that, we say to this woman: So long as she sees menses – that is, bleeding – for seven days, then that is followed by brownish or yellowish discharge, she should do ghusl after the bleeding of menses stops – that is, after the completion of seven days – then start to pray and fast, and her husband may have intercourse with her if she has a husband, even if she has yellowish or brownish discharge.""(Al-Liqa’ ash-Shahri\xa0 36/22).\nThe shaykh also argued that menses is the bleeding, not the yellowish and brownish discharge. Al-Liqa’ ash-Shari (51/8).\nWith regard to the report of ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), he interpreted it as referring to the emission of yellowish discharge before the bleeding ceases, as noted above in the chapter heading given by al-Bukhari to the hadith of Umm ‘Atiyyah.\nWhatever the case, the more correct view regarding this issue is that brownish and yellowish discharge during the days of menses is also menses, and this is what the jurists refer to as being “within the expected timeframe.” Whether it occurs at the beginning of menses and is connected to it, or during menses, or at the end of menses, if the bleeding has stopped and the brownish and yellowish discharge continue, all of that is menses. This is the view of the majority of scholars concerning that, to the extent that it was narrated that there was consensus.\nThirdly:\nThe end of menses may be confirmed by dryness, according to most jurists, except for what was narrated from Malik (may Allah have mercy on him) about the woman who usually sees the white discharge; in her case, the end of menses is not marked by dryness.\nShaykh Abu ‘Umar ad-Dubyan said in Mawsu‘at at-Taharah (7/37):\n4. The sign of the end of menses\nIt was said: When menses ends, the woman definitely becomes pure, whether any white moisture comes out after that or not. This is the view of the Hanafis, Shafa‘is and Hanbalis.\nAnd it was said that if she is one of those who see the white discharge, her menses does not end until she sees it, and if she is one of those who do not see that, then her menses ends when she sees dryness. This is the view stated in al-Mudawwanah from Imam Malik (may Allah have mercy on him).\nAnd it was said that in the case of the woman whose sign of menses ending is usually the white discharge, if she sees dryness, then her menses has ended, but in the case of the woman whose sign of menses ending is usually dryness, her menses does not end if she sees the white discharge, until she sees dryness.\nAnd it was said that there are two signs of the end of menses: dryness and the white discharge. So whichever of the two the woman sees, this is the sign that her menses has ended, regardless of whether the woman usually knows that her menses has ended by seeing the white discharge or dryness. This is the view of Ibn Habib, among the companions of Malik (may Allah have mercy on him).\nAnd it was said: When the woman sees traces of red blood, or something like water after washing meat (i.e., a pinkish discharge), or a yellowish or brownish discharge, or a white discharge, or complete dryness, then her menses has ended. This is the view of Ibn Hazm.\nThus it becomes clear that the different views are as follows:\n\nWhat matters is complete dryness.\nThe white discharge takes precedence over dryness, if she experiences it.\nDryness takes precedence over the white discharge, if she experiences both.\nDryness and the white discharge are both signs of the end of menses.\nIf she sees traces of red blood, or something like water after washing meat (i.e., a pinkish discharge), or a yellowish or brownish discharge, or a white discharge, or complete dryness, then her menses has ended.\n\n…\nThe evidence for those who said that if she sees the white discharge, then dryness does not matter is what ‘Isa ibn Dinar said: The white discharge is more indicative of the end of menses than dryness.\nAl-Hafiz said: The cotton may come out dry during menses, so it does not prove that menses has ended, in contrast to the white discharge. End quote.\nThere is no view contrary to the view that dryness is the sign of the end of menses, except what we have quoted above from Malik.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/317771/is-dryness-the-agreed-upon-sign-of-the-end-of-menses
375425,"Our residental scholar in southern california couldn’t answer my question so Im writing to you. My question being I live in an area in the country which is extremely rural and there is no halal meat so I have decided to take up hunting. I don’t want to bother the neighbors with a loud firearm so have thus decided to go the route of a powerful BB-gun or air rifle as some call it. Anyways I wonder if a bb-gun is permissible to hunt with for the reason that the BBs or ammo typically used are round or blunted, not sharp or pointed, for the most part (though some do exist there still not all that sharp)? I ask all this because I want to know if I will have killed my game by “violet blow” if I use rounded blunted BBs? With BB guns since there much less powerful then real firearms the name of the game is head shots and taking shots no further then 30 yards from target. The bb gun Im getting is a .22 caliber, Im told its able to take down a fox by the airgun specialist, though I don’t know how humane a kill that would be regardless Typically with airguns you want to hunt small game like quail, squirrels, doves, and rabbits which is what Im hunting. All game thats permissible to hunt with a BB gun correct insh Allah?","['Praise be to Allah.It is stipulated that the weapon used for hunting should be sharp so that it creates a wound and has an impact on the flesh by cutting or piercing.\nThe pellets that are shot by an air rifle for hunting cut and penetrate the body, so it is valid to hunt with it.\nIt says in al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (28/133): We may sum up the conditions on hunting tools as follows:\nThe first condition:\nThe tool should be sharp so that it creates a wound and has an impact on the flesh by cutting or piercing, otherwise [the prey] is not permissible unless it is slaughtered in the manner prescribed in Islamic teachings.\nIt is not stipulated that the tool should be metal. Therefore it is valid to hunt with any sharp weapon, whether it is metal, wood sharpened to a point, stone knapped to create a sharp edge, or other materials that can penetrate the body.\nThe second condition:\nThe projectile should strike the prey with the sharp edge or point in order to wound it, and the hunter should be certain that death resulted from the wound, otherwise it is not permissible to eat it, because if it is killed by the blunt edge of the tool or by its weight, it is regarded as having been killed by a violent blow. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {Prohibited to you are dead animals, blood, the flesh of swine, and that which has been dedicated to other than Allah, and [those animals] killed by strangling or by a violent blow\xa0…} [al-Ma’idah 5:3]. And it was narrated that ‘Adiy ibn Hatim (may Allah be pleased with him) said to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): I shoot the game with a mi‘rad (a short, blunt, featherless arrow) and I hit it. He said: “If you shoot the mi‘rad and it pierces (the prey), then eat it, but if it strikes it with its edge, then do not eat it.” [Narrated by Muslim]. According to another version narrated by Muslim: the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If you shoot and mention the name of Allah, and it pierces the prey, then eat. But if it does not pierce it, do not eat it. And do not eat it if you strike it with the edge of the mi‘rad, unless you are able to slaughter it in the prescribed manner. And do not eat what is stuck with clay pellets, unless you are able to slaughter it in the prescribed manner. [Narrated by Ahmad]. And it was narrated that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade using small pebbles [for hunting], and he said: “They are not useful for hunting and are not effective in fighting the enemy, but they may break a tooth or put out an eye.” [Agreed upon].\nIt also says [in al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (28/135): Hunting with bunduq (bullets or pellets):\nThe Arabic word bunduq may mean several things, including what is eaten [hazelnuts] and what is made of balls of clay or lead that are shot at the prey when hunting.\nWhat is meant here is what is shot at the prey.\nWith regard to pellets made of clay, the jurists are unanimously agreed that what is killed by being shot with a heavy ball of clay is not permissible to eat, because it was killed by the weight of the projectile and not by its sharp point or edge…\nAl-Bujayrami said: Ibn ‘Abd as-Salam issued a fatwa stating that it is haram to shoot with clay pellets, and this is stated clearly in adh-Dhakha’ir. But an-Nawawi issued a fatwa stating that it is permissible, i.e., to shoot with clay pellets, but some of the scholars restricted it to cases where the prey does not usually die as a result, such as geese. But if the prey does die, as in the case of smaller birds, then it is haram. But if the pellets strike it and cut its neck with the force of the impact, or decapitate it, it is haram. This discussion is the correct view…\nAll of this applies to pellets made of clay or lead that are launched without combustion.\nAs for projectiles made of metal that are shot by firing a gun, the jurists differed concerning that. The Hanafis and Shafa‘is stated that it is haram…\nAd-Dardir, who was one of the Malikis, stated that it is permissible, as he said: As for lead, that which is shot with it may be eaten, because it is more powerful than other weapons, as is the view adopted by some scholars. Then ad-Dasuqi explained the matter further, as he said: To conclude, hunting with lead bullets is a matter concerning which there is no comment from the earlier scholars, because it is something that was introduced after the introduction of gunpowder in the middle of the last century.\nThe later scholars differed concerning that. Some of them said that it is not allowed, by analogy with clay balls, and others said that it is permissible, because it causes the blood to flow and kills quickly, as prescribed. Comparing lead bullets to clay balls is an invalid analogy, because there is a difference, which is that lead bullets pierce the skin and penetrate the body in a real sense, which is not the case with clay balls; rather all the latter do is cause pain and break bones. End quote.\nSee the answer to question no. 121239 which states that it is permissible to hunt with rifles.\nThere is no difference between a rifle that uses bullets and an air rifle, especially if what is hunted with it is small animals such as pigeons and rabbits.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/375425/ruling-on-hunting-with-air-rifle-pellets
