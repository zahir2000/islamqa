317960,"Is it permissible to appoint a pilgrim who is going to stay [in Mina until the 13th Dhul-Hijjah] to stone the jamarat on behalf of a pilgrim who is going to hasten his departure [and leave Mina on 12th Dhul-Hijjah], because it is difficult to reach the jamarat before sunset?","['Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to appoint someone else to stone the jamarat unless you are unable to do it because of sickness or old age that makes it difficult to go to the jamarat.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If a man is sick or detained, or has a valid excuse, it is permissible for him to appoint someone to stone the jamarat on his behalf.""(Al-Mughni\xa0\xa03/427).\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: There is nothing wrong with appointing someone to stone the jamarat on behalf of one who is sick, or a woman who is unable to do it because she is pregnant, or heavy, or weak, and is not able to stone the jamarat.""(Majmu‘ Fatawa Ibn Baz\xa0 17/301).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is not permissible for a woman or anyone else to appoint someone to stone the jamarat on her behalf, because stoning the jamarat is one of the actions of hajj, and Allah, may He be Blessed and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And complete the hajj and ‘umrah for Allah}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:196].\nHence the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) gave permission to the weak ones among his family to move on from Muzdalifah at night, so that they would reach Mina before the crowds and stone Jamrat al-‘Aqabah, but he did not give them permission to appoint someone to stone the jamarat on their behalf. Similarly, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) gave permission to the camel herders to stone the jamarat one day and not the next, and he did not give them permission to appoint someone else to stone them on their behalf. This indicates that it is a must for the pilgrim to stone the jamarat himself.""(Majmu‘ Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymin\xa023/107).\nAnd he said: If the pilgrim is not able to stone the jamarat either because of old age, or sickness, or the pilgrim is a woman who is pregnant, or a woman or man who is blind and it is too difficult for them to do it, then in this case there is nothing wrong with appointing someone else to do it on their behalf, because of necessity.""(Majmu ‘ Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymin\xa0 23/119).\nAs for hastening to depart [on 12th Dhul-Hijjah], that is not an excuse, because there is enough time from noon until sunset to stone the jamarat, no matter where he is in Mina, as is the case for thousands of people nowadays, who may be at the far edges of Mina and in Muzdalifah, but they are able to stone the jamarat and hasten their departure.\nIf a person has no excuse that would keep him from stoning the jamarat, it is not permissible for him to appoint someone else to do it on his behalf.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/317960/is-it-permissible-for-one-who-wants-to-hasten-his-departure-to-appoint-someone-else-to-stone-the-jamarat-because-it-is-difficult-for-him-to-reach-the-jamarat-before-sunset
391078,I want to do ‘umrah but I still owe a fidyah for wearing tailored clothing when I did Hajj. What is the ruling if I do ‘umrah before paying the fidyah?,"['Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with you doing ‘umrah even though you still owe a fidyah for Hajj.\nBut this fidyah is a debt that you owe, and you should hasten to pay it.\nThe fidyah for wearing tailored clothing is one of the following options: Slaughtering a sheep [and distributing the meat to the poor of the Haram], or feeding six poor persons, or fasting for three days, because Allah, may He be exalted, says regarding the fidyah for one who has an ailment (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And whoever among you is ill or has an ailment of the head [making shaving necessary must offer] a ransom of fasting [three days] or charity or sacrifice}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:196].\nThe fidyah for wearing tailored clothes is the same as that, by analogy.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/391078/is-it-permissible-for-him-to-do-umrah-when-he-owes-a-fidyah-for-hajj
409850,"In the hadith of ‘A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), she said to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): O Messenger of Allah, do women have to do jihad? He said: “Yes, they have to do a jihad in which there is no fighting: Hajj and ‘umrah.” If a woman’s jihad is Hajj, does this mean that if a woman dies during her Hajj she is a martyr who died in Allah’s cause?","['Praise be to Allah.It is proven that Hajj is the jihad of women.\nAl-Bukhari (1520) narrated from ‘Aishah, the Mother of the Believers (may Allah be pleased with her), that she said: O Messenger of Allah, we see that jihad is the best of deeds; shouldn’t we (women) engage in jihad? He said: “No, but the best of jihad is an accepted Hajj.”\nIbn Majah (2901) narrated that ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: O Messenger of Allah, is jihad obligatory for women? He said: “Yes, they have to do a jihad in which there is no fighting: Hajj and ‘Umrah.”\nIt is not mentioned in the hadith that if a woman dies [during Hajj] she will attain the reward of martyrdom, for the reward of jihad does not necessarily imply the reward of martyrdom. But if the woman hopes for the status of martyrdom and seeks to attain it, and wants to do Hajj because it is the jihad that she is able to do, then in this case if she dies, there is the hope that she will attain the reward of martyrdom, because of her intention, not because merely dying during Hajj means that one has automatically attained martyrdom. That is because of the general meaning of the hadith narrated by Sahl ibn Abi Umamah ibn Sahl ibn Hunayf, from his father, from his grandfather, that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever sincerely asks Allah for martyrdom, Allah will cause him to attain the status of the martyrs, even if he dies in his bed.” Narrated by Muslim (1909).\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWith regard to the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), “Whoever sincerely seeks martyrdom will be granted it, even if he does not die as a martyr”\xa0 – And according to another report, “Whoever sincerely asks Allah for martyrdom, Allah will cause him to attain the status of the martyrs, even if he dies in his bed” – what is meant by the former report is explained by the latter. When taken together, what they mean is that if he sincerely asks for martyrdom, he will be granted some of the reward of the martyrs, even if he dies in his bed. This indicates that it is recommended to ask for martyrdom and to always aspire for what is good.
