434498,What is the ruling on one who falls asleep whilst being carried in tawaf or sa‘i?,"['Praise be to Allah.In the case of tawaf, in order for it to be valid, it is stipulated that one should be in a state of purity, according to the majority of jurists. This is in contrast to sa‘i.\nSee the answer to question no. 34695 .\nBased on that, if the one who was doing tawaf fell asleep and slept in the manner that invalidates wudu’, then his tawaf is invalid because his wudu’ was invalidated.\nIf he slept in a way that did not lead to his wudu’ becoming invalidated, then his tawaf is sound.\nIf he fell asleep during sa‘i, that does not affect his sa‘i, because in the case of sa‘i it is not stipulated that one should be in a state of purity.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If he fell asleep during tawaf or part of it in a manner that does not invalidate wudu’, then the more correct scholarly view is that his tawaf is valid in this case.""(Al-Majmu‘\xa0\xa08/16).\nAl-Khatib ash-Sharbini (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If he fell asleep during tawaf in a manner that does not invalidate wudu’, then his tawaf was not interrupted.""(Mughni al-Muhtaj\xa0 2/244).\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: It was noted that in the case of some pilgrims who are unable to do tawaf and sa‘i themselves, so they are carried [for these rituals], some of them are overcome by sleep during the ritual. What is the ruling on tawaf and sa‘i in this case?\nHe replied: What the pilgrim must do is pay attention and take care with regard to his tawaf and sa‘i. Drowsiness does not matter, but what he must do is take care, especially in tawaf, because sleeping deeply invalidates wudu’, and one of the conditions of tawaf is being in a state of purity. As for drowsiness, it does not matter if the head droops, so if he becomes drowsy but is not overcome by sleep, that does not affect his tawaf and it does not affect his sa‘i. But it must be noted that when he is doing tawaf, whether he is in a wheelchair or is being carried by men, he must pay attention to this so that he does not fall asleep in a way that would invalidate his wudu’ when he is doing tawaf.\nIn the case of sa‘i, it is not stipulated that one should be in a state of purity, so if he falls asleep, that will not affect his sa‘i, because sleep does not invalidate sa‘i. Being in a state of purity is not stipulated in the case of sa‘i; rather it is recommended that one should be in a state of purity for it. So if a person falls asleep during his sa‘i and seven laps are completed, that is acceptable, praise be to Allah, and even if he is unaware during sa‘i because of sleep or because of being distracted by intrusive thoughts, that does not matter, in sha Allah. But in the case of tawaf, there is the fear that his wudu’ may become invalidated because of sleep.""(Fatawa Nur ‘ala ad-Darb\xa0 18/21).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/434498/what-is-the-ruling-on-one-who-falls-asleep-whilst-being-carried-in-tawaf-or-sai
136609,"I needed money, so I borrowed some gold from my wife, and we agreed that I should pay her back in gold. After two years, the price of gold rose unbelievably, and is now double. I have no choice but to pay double the price of the gold that I borrowed in the beginning. Is this increase regarded as riba?","['Praise be to Allah.If someone burrows gold, then he must pay back in gold of the same weight, and the difference in value of the gold makes no difference. The increase in its value is not regarded as riba at all.\nIt is permissible for you to give cash instead of gold, but that is on condition that it be equivalent to the price of gold on the day of paying off the debt, and you should pay the price in full, and not leave anything of what you owe outstanding.\nThe scholars of the Permanent Committee said:\nLoans must be paid off in the same type of wealth, and this is what fairness dictates. The rise and fall in value is something that may benefit or harm either party. Fluctuation in prices happened at the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), but the basic Islamic principle that was ordained for the Muslims was not changed because of that, and they are to handle their affairs in the light of that ruling.\nThe borrower may return the value of the loan at the time of paying off his debt, if the lender agrees to that, because it is soundly narrated from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: We used to sell camels for dinars and accept dirhams, and we used to sell them for dirhams and accept dinars. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There is nothing wrong with you accepting them at that day’s price, so long as you do not part with any outstanding business remaining between you.”(Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah\xa013/275).\nThey also said:\nThere is nothing wrong with borrowing gold then returning the equivalent amount, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Gold for gold, weight for weight, like for like.” Similarly, he may return its value at the current price, hand to hand.""(Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah\xa0 14/113).\nConclusion: what you must do is return the gold as you took it, by weight, and the increase in its price is not regarded as riba.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/136609/he-borrowed-some-gold-from-his-wife-and-when-the-time-came-to-pay-her-back-the-price-of-gold-had-risen-does-this-come-under-the-heading-of-riba
400548,"I have a question about Hajj. If someone who is a resident of Makkah did Hajj ifrad [i.e., Hajj on its own, without ‘umrah], and after stoning Jamrat al-‘Aqabah he did tawaf al-ifadah and did not do sa‘i, because he thought that residents of Makkah do not have to do sa‘i , then he exited ihram completely and had intercourse with his wife, should he have done sa‘i, or is it indeed the case that the residents of Makkah do not have to do sa‘i? If he should have done sa‘i, and there is no difference between the residents of Makkah and others, then what is the expiation for that? How can he make up for the shortcoming in his Hajj? Please note that he did ‘umrah after that, and did another Hajj. With regard to his having had intercourse with his wife, does the fact that he did tawaf al-ifadah only, and not sa‘i, and that was after stoning Jamrat al-‘Aqabah, mean that he is regarded as having exited ihram completely, or must sa‘i be done with tawaf in order to exit ihram? Does he have to offer any kaffarah (expiation) or fidyah (ransom)?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe pilgrim (whether he is doing ifrad, qiran or tamattu‘) must do sa‘i, going back and forth between as-Safa and al-Marwah. That is one of the pillars or essential parts of Hajj, without which it is not complete. There is no differentiation in that regard between the residents of Makkah and others.\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: We are residents of Makkah. I did Hajj last year; I did tawaf but I did not do sa‘i. What is the ruling on that?\nHe replied: You must do sa‘i. What you did was wrong, because sa‘i is essential, whether you are one of the residents of Makkah or not. It is essential to do sa‘i after tawaf. After coming down from ‘Arafah, you must do tawaf and sa‘i, and the one who failed to do sa‘i must do it now.""(Fatawa ash-Shaykh Ibn Baz\xa0 17/341).\nSecondly:\nWith regard to exiting ihram completely, that can only be achieved by doing tawaf and sa‘i. So if someone did tawaf but did not do sa‘i, he has not exited ihram completely, so what he must do is refrain from having intercourse with his wife.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The second stage of exiting ihram cannot be regarded as complete until after doing tawaf al-ifadah and sa‘i, whether the pilgrim is doing tamattu‘ or qiran or ifrad, if he did not do sa‘i when he did the tawaf of arrival.""(Fatawa Arkan al-Islam\xa0p. 541).\nIf he thinks that he exited ihram and had intercourse with his wife, then we hope that he will be excused because of his being unaware of the ruling, and he does not have to do anything else. But if he is able to slaughter a sheep and distribute its meat to the poor of the Haram, that will be more prudent and more appropriate.\nPlease see the answer to question no. 104178 .\nThirdly:\nIf someone still owes the sa‘i of Hajj then enters ihram for ‘umrah, this ihram for ‘umrah is invalid, because he is still in a state of ihram for Hajj. So the sa‘i that he did thinking that it was for ‘umrah counts for his Hajj, and by doing it he has completed his Hajj.\nAd-Dardir said in ash-Sharh al-Kabir (2/27): The actions that he did as ‘umrah, become invalidated if that follows Hajj, because ‘umrah is of a lower status and Hajj is of a higher status. End quote.\nWe asked Shaykh ‘Abd ar-Rahman al-Barrak (may Allah preserve him) about a woman who did ‘umrah and forgot to cut her hair, then she went and entered ihram for another ‘umrah, and she did tawaf and sa‘i, then cut her hair.\nHe replied: Doing one ‘umrah after another is something that is not known to the jurists of the Muslims. Therefore the second ‘umrah is invalid, and her cutting her hair counts for the first ‘umrah. End quote.\nThe fact that he intended this sa‘i to be for ‘umrah and not for Hajj does not matter, because the correct scholarly view is that it is sufficient to have the intention of doing sa‘i, and it is not stipulated that it should be intended specifically for Hajj.\nSee: ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘ (7/403).\nSee also the answer to question no. 280967 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/400548/he-did-not-do-sai-for-hajj-then-he-did-umrah-after-that-is-his-hajj-complete
