300311,"One of the texts which prove it is permissible to wipe over the khuffs is the hadith of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), which is: It was narrated that al-Mugheerah ibn Shu‘bah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I was with the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on a journey. I bent down to take off his khuffs and he said: “Leave them, for I put them on when my feet were clean.” Then he wiped over them. The scholars say that one of the conditions of it being permissible to wipe over the khuffs is that they should have been put on when one was in a state of purity, referring to wudu’, based on this hadith. I do not understand this, because in the text of the hadith it says that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) put on the khuffs when his feet were clean, as he said. Does this refer to wudu’? Because his feet may have been clean without him having done wudu’, and he could have said, “Leave them, for I put them on when I was in a state of purity,” not “when my feet were clean.” I hope that you can give me an answer about this confusion. May Allah reward you with good.","['Praise be to Allah.The majority of jurists stipulated that in order for wiping over the khuffs to be permissible, they must have been put on when one was in a state of purity. They based that on the hadith of al-Mugheerah ibn Shu‘bah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: I was with the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on a journey. I bent down to take off his khuffs and he said: “Leave them, for I put them on when my feet were clean.” \xa0Narrated by al-Bukhari (206) and Muslim (274).\nDawud az-Zahiri (the literalist) was of the view that what is stipulated is that the feet should be clean only.\nWhat supports the view of the majority is the report narrated by ‘Abd ar-Razzaaq in his Musannaf (793), Ibn Khuzaymah (193) and Ibn Hibban (1325) from Safwan ibn ‘Assal (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: We were with the army that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) sent out. He ordered us to wipe over our khuffs, if we had put them on when in a state of purity, for three days when we were travelling, and for one night if we were not travelling, and not to take them off after defecating or urinating, and not to take them off except in the case of janabah. Classed as hasan by al-Albani and by Shu ‘ayb al-Arna’ut in Takhrij Ibn Hibban.\nAl-Bayhaqi narrated it in as-Sunan al-Kubra (1/423) as follows: If we had put them on in a state of purity. Its isnad was classed as jayyid by an-Nawawi in al-Majmu‘ (1/512).\nFor more information, please see: at-Tibyan fi Tabwib wa Takhrij Bulugh al-Maram by Khalid al-Shalahi (2/47-51).\nIbn Khuzaymah commented on that by saying: I mentioned to al-Muzani the report narrated by ‘Abd al-Razzaq, and he said: Narrate that to our companions, for there is no stronger evidence for ash-Shafa‘i than that. End quote.\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar said: Even though the hadith of Safwan is sahih, it does not meet the conditions of al-Bukhari. But the hadith that is mentioned in al-Bukhari is in harmony with this hadith, which stipulates that one should be in a state of purity when putting them on.\nAl-Muzani was referring to a difference of opinion regarding this matter. In brief, al-Shafa‘i and the majority of scholars understood the references to cleanliness as meaning taharah (purity) in the shar‘i, ritual sense, i.e., wudu’, whilst Dawud disagreed and said: If there was no impurity (najasah) on the person’s feet when he put on the khuffs, it is permissible to wipe over them.""(Fath al-Bari\xa0 1/309).\nThus it becomes clear that the view of the majority is sound and their evidence is strong for stipulating that the khuffs should have been put on when in a state of purity.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/300311/what-is-the-evidence-for-stipulating-that-one-should-be-in-a-state-of-purity-before-putting-on-the-khuffs
259676,"Our Lord, may He be Glorified and Exalted, enjoins us in the Holy Quran to remember the blessings that Allah has bestowed upon us, numerous blessings, such as when He, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning]:","['Praise be to Allah.The command mentioned in the verse quoted by the questioner is a command to the Companions and the believers to remember the blessings of Allah and His grace towards them, and His kindness to them in causing the defeat of their enemies and frustrating their enemies’ plots.\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Here Allah, may He be Exalted, is speaking of His blessings, grace and kindness to His believing slaves when He averted their enemies and inflicted defeat upon them in the year when they came together and formed an alliance against them, which was the year of Al-Khandaq [the Trench]."" (Tafsir Ibn Kathir,\xa0 6/383)\nWhen there is a command in the Quran to remember Allah’s blessing, what is meant is to remember it in one’s heart, by calling to mind Allah’s grace and favour in bestowing it upon His slaves; remembering it in one’s words, by speaking of it; and remembering it in one’s physical actions, by not using that blessing in ways that incur the wrath of Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted.\nRemembering the blessing is giving thanks for it , and may be done in one’s heart, in one’s words or in one’s actions; each of them confirms the others, unless the gratitude is false.\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said, commenting on the verse (interpretation of the meaning): “And remember the favour of Allah upon you.” [Al-Baqarah 2:231]:\n“Remembering may be done in one’s heart, in one’s words and in one’s actions. Remembering it in one’s words means saying: Allah has blessed me with such and such, as Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “But as for the favour of your Lord, report [it]” [Ad-Duha 93:11]. So you should praise Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, for it by saying: O Allah, to You be praise for what you have blessed me with of wealth, or a wife, or children, and so on.\nRemembering it in one’s heart is by calling it to mind and acknowledging that it is a blessing from Allah.\nRemembering it in one’s actions is by striving to obey Allah, and by showing the effects of His blessing on you."" (Tafsir Surat Al-Baqarah\xa0 3/132)\nAl-Harawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “What is meant by gratitude is three things: acknowledging the blessing, then appreciating the blessing, then giving praise for it .”\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said, commenting on the words of Al-Harawi:\n“As for acknowledging it, that means calling it to mind, realising its significance and recognising it as a blessing in and of itself.\nSo acknowledging it is done in the mind.\nAppreciating it means showing humility when receiving it from the Bestower, by expressing one’s need for it and acknowledging that it came to him without him deserving it and without him paying any price; rather he sees himself as being completely dependent upon Allah. This attitude shows true appreciation.\n“then giving praise for it”: praise for the Bestower in connection with the blessing is of two types: general and specific.\nThe general type is ascribing to Him the attributes of generosity, kindness, munificence and so on.\nThe specific type is speaking of His blessing, and stating that it came to him from Him, as Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “But as for the favour of your Lord, report [it].” [Ad-Duha 93:11]\nRegarding this reporting or speaking of the blessing that is enjoined, there are two views:\nThe first is that it means mentioning the blessing and speaking of it, by saying: Allah has blessed me with such and such. Muqatil (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Give thanks for what Allah has mentioned of blessings to you in this surah, such as helping orphans, granting guidance after misguidance, and granting self-sufficiency after poverty.\nSpeaking of the blessings of Allah is gratitude , as in the Hadith of Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him): “Whoever has a favour done for him, let him reciprocate, and if he cannot reciprocate, then let him praise [the person who did him the favour], for if he praises him, then he has thanked him, but if he conceals it, then he has been ungrateful towards him. And whoever pretends to have what he has not been given is like one who wears two garments of falsehood.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari in Al-Adab Al-Mufrad, 215; classed as authentic by Al-Albani)\nThis Hadith mentions three types of people: one who is grateful for the blessing and gives praise for it; one who denies it and conceals it; and one who pretends to be one of those who were given it when that is not the case, so he pretends to have something that he was not given. In another report it says: “Whoever does not give thanks for a little will not give thanks for a great deal, and whoever does not show gratitude to people has not shown gratitude to Allah. Speaking of the blessing of Allah is gratitude, and not speaking of it is ingratitude. Unity is a mercy and division is a punishment.” [Narrated by ‘Abdullah ibn Ahmad in Zawa’id Al-Musnad, 18449; classed as sound by Al-Albani)\nThe second view is that speaking of the blessing that is enjoined in this verse [at the end of Surah Ad-Duha, quoted above] means calling people to Allah, conveying His message and teaching the Ummah. Mujahid (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It refers to Prophethood. Az-Zajjaj (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It means: Convey that with which you [O Prophet] have been sent, and speak of the Prophethood that Allah has bestowed upon you. Al-Kalbi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It refers to the Quran, which Allah commanded him to recite.\nThe correct view is that it includes both types, because each of them is a blessing for which it is enjoined to give thanks and speak of it. Manifesting it is part of being grateful for it."" (Madarij As-Salikin 2/237)\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said regarding gratitude:\n“It is based on three pillars: acknowledging it inwardly, speaking of it outwardly, and using it to earn the pleasure of the One Who granted it and bestowed it.""

In this case, he may continue to wipe over his socks for the period allowed for one who is not travelling, because wiping over the socks for three days is only for one who is travelling, but now he is no longer travelling.

Some people say that the wife`s relatives are not kindred.\xa0\nHe replied:\xa0\n“The kindred are the blood relatives on your mother`s and father`s sides. They are the ones meant in the verses in Surat Al-Anfal and Surat Al-Ahzab in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“But kindred by blood are nearer to one another (regarding inheritance) in the decree ordained by Allah.” [Al-Anfal 8:75; Al-Ahzab 33:6]\nThe closest of them are fathers, mothers, grandparents, children and their children, no matter how far the line of descent goes, then the next closest and the next closest of brothers and their children, paternal uncles and aunts and their children, and maternal uncles and aunts and their children.\xa0\nIt is narrated in an authentic report from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that someone asked him: “Whom should I honour, O Messenger of Allah?” He said, “Your mother.” He said: “Then whom?” He said: “Your mother.” He said: “Then whom?” He said, “Your mother.” He said: “Then whom?” He said: “Then your father, then the next closest and the next closest.” (Narrated by Muslim.

Rather He gave them provision and sent down to him and his descendents revelation; some of them believed and some of them disbelieved. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And verily, We have sent among every Ummah (community, nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): ‘Worship Allah (Alone), and avoid (or keep away from) Taghut (all false deities besides Allah).’ Then of them were some whom Allah guided and of them were some upon whom the straying was justified.” [An-Nahl 16:36]\xa0\nThere are four heavenly books which Allah sent down. They are the Tawrat (Torah),\xa0Injil (Gospel ), Zabur (Psalms) and the Quran. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“It is He Who has sent down the Book (the Quran) to you (Muhammad) with truth, confirming what came before it. And He sent down the Tawrat (Torah) and the Injil (Gospel).”\xa0[Al `Imran 3:3] \xa0\nAllah also says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“and to Dawud (David) We gave the Zabur (Psalms)”\xa0[Al-Isra’ 17:55]\xa0\nNumber of the Messengers of Allah\nThe Prophets and Messengers were many, and no one knows their number except Allah. Among them are those of whom Allah has told us, and some of whom He has not told us. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And Messengers We have mentioned to you before, and Messengers We have not mentioned to you.” [An-Nisa’ 4:164]\xa0\nThe obligation to believe in the Books and Messengers of Allah\nIt is obligatory to believe in all the Books which Allah has revealed and in all the Prophets and Messengers whom Allah has sent, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“O you who believe! Believe in Allah, and His Messenger (Muhammad), and the Book (the Quran) which He has sent down to His Messenger, and the Scripture which He sent down to those before (him); and whosoever disbelieves in Allah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, and the Last Day, then indeed he has strayed far away.” [An-Nisa’ 4:136]\xa0\nDifference between Nabi and Rasool\nRasool (Messenger) and Nabi (Prophet) are two names with the same meaning. It refers to someone whom Allah sent to call the people to worship Allah alone, one of the Prophets and Messengers whom Allah chose and sent to His slaves to convey His religion. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\xa0\n“Messengers as bearers of good news as well as of warning in order that mankind should have no plea against Allah after the (coming of) Messengers.” [An-Nisa’ 4:165]\xa0\nNames of Messengers and Prophets mentioned in the Quran\nThe Prophets and Messengers are many , of whom Allah has mentioned twenty five in the Quran, and we are obliged to believe in all of them.

Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\xa0\xa0\n“And verily, We have sent among every Ummah (community, nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): ‘Worship Allah (Alone), and avoid (or keep away from) Taghut (all false deities besides Allah).’ Then of them were some whom Allah guided and of them were some upon whom the straying was justified”[An-Nahl 16:36]\xa0\nAllah favoured some of the Prophets and Messengers over others. The best of them are the “Messengers of strong will” who are Nuh, Ibrahim, Musa, ‘Isa and Muhammad; and the best of the Messengers of strong will is Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). For each Prophet was sent only to his own people, until Allah sent Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to all of mankind. He is the last and the best of the Prophets and Messengers, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And We have not sent you (O Muhammad) except as a giver of glad tidings and a warner to all mankind, but most of men know not.” [Saba’ 34:28 – interpretation of the meaning]\xa0\nThe obligation to follow the example of the Messengers of Allah\nThe Prophets and Messengers were chosen by Allah to be an example to their nations. He taught them, guided them and honoured them with the Message; He protected them from falling into sin and supported them with miracles. So they are the most perfect of humanity both physically and in their attitude, the best of them in knowledge, the most truthful in speech, the most exemplary in the life they lived. Allah says of them (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And We made them leaders, guiding (mankind) by Our Command, and We revealed to them the doing of good deeds, performing Prayer, and the giving of Zakah and of Us (Alone) they were the worshippers.” [Al-Anbiya’ 21:73]\xa0\nBecause the Prophets and Messengers reached such a high status of obedience and good character , Allah has commanded us to take them as an example. Allah says ((interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“They are those whom Allah had guided. So follow their guidance.” [Al-An`am 6:90]\xa0\nAll of the characteristics of the Prophets and Messengers were combined in our Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and Allah honoured him by instilling in him the noblest characteristics.
