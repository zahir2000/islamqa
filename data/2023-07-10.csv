254065,"There is a hadith which says that a woman offered herself to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). What is meant by a woman offering herself to a man? Does it mean that she offers her body, or does it mean seeking regular marriage? Why did the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) reject her; was it only because she was not beautiful, or was it because he had no need of her at all, such as fulfilling desire, because she was not beautiful, or because her religious commitment was lacking, or because she had no talents that could help him in his da‘wah?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nWhat is meant by a woman offering herself to a man is that he may marry her, but without a mahr. This was only for the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and not for any of his ummah.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{O Prophet, indeed We have made lawful to you your wives to whom you have given their due compensation … and a believing woman if she gives herself to the Prophet [and] if the Prophet wishes to marry her, [this is] only for you, excluding the [other] believers}\xa0[al-Ahzaab 33:50].\nAl-Baji (may Allah have mercy on him) said: There is no difference of scholarly opinion regarding the fact that it is not permissible to get married without giving a mahr for anyone other than the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). The basic principle concerning that is the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says:\n{O Prophet, indeed We have made lawful to you your wives to whom you have given their due compensation … and a believing woman if she gives herself to the Prophet [and] if the Prophet wishes to marry her, [this is] only for you, excluding the [other] believers}\xa0[al-Ahzaab 33:50].\nHere Allah, may He be exalted, stated that that was only for the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), to the exclusion of all other believers, so that is not permissible for anyone except him.\nBased on the meaning of this hadith, the woman said to him: O Messenger of Allah, I offer myself to you. He did not criticise her for that, and if it was wrong, he would have objected to it and would not have approved of it, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) could not approve of any falsehood. Moreover, when someone else stood up and asked to marry her, he did not let him marry her without a dowry, even though he was poor and in need, and had nothing to give her as a dowry, to the extent that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) married her to him for what he had memorised of the Qur’an. If it were permissible for anyone other than the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to marry without giving a mahr, he would not have prevented it in this case, even though the man is very poor and in great need.""(Al-Muntaqa Sharh al-Muwatta’\xa0 3/275).\nSecondly:\nAl-Bukhari (5030) and Muslim (1425) narrated from Sahl ibn Sa‘d that a woman came to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and said: O Messenger of Allah, I have come to give myself to you (in marriage). The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) looked her up and down, then he lowered his head. When the woman saw that he had not made any decision about her, she sat down. A man among his companions stood up and said: O Messenger of Allah, if you have no need of her then marry her to me. He said: “Do you have anything?” He said: No, by Allah, O Messenger of Allah. He said: “Go to your family and see if you can find something.” So he went, then he came back and said: No, by Allah, O Messenger of Allah, I did not find anything. He said: “Go (and see if you can find something), even if it is a ring of iron. So he went, then he came back and said: No, by Allah, O Messenger of Allah, not even a ring of iron, only this izar (lower garment) of mine – Sahl said: he did not have a rida’ (upper garment) – and she may have half of it. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “What will she do with your izar? If you wear it she will not have anything of it and if she wears it you will not have anything of it.” The man sat down, and after he had sat for a long time, he got up (to leave). The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) saw him turning away, and he ordered that he be called to him. When he came, he said: “What do you know of the Qur’an?” He said: I know Surah such and such, and Surah such and such, and Surah such and such – and he listed them. He said: “Do you recite them by heart?” He said: Yes. He said: “Go. I give her to you (in marriage) for what you know of the Qur’an.”\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) only looked at her because his position was like that of a suitor, who is allowed to look at the woman to whom he wants to propose marriage, then if he likes her he may marry her, and if he does not like her, he must avert his gaze.\nIbn al-Jawzi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Then he looked her up and down” means that he looked at her face, then lowered his gaze to look at what is below that. This indicates that it is permissible to look at the woman whom one wants to marry. He only did that because it was possible that he might have wanted to marry her, then when he decided not to marry her, he lowered his head.""(Kashf al-Mushkil\xa02/270).\nAn-Nawawi said: This indicates that it is permissible for the one who wants to marry a woman to examine her.""(Sharh Muslim\xa09/212).\nAs for the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) not wanting to marry her, we cannot be certain about the reason for that. How many suitors look at a woman then change their mind, despite her beauty. The matter is not limited to the issue of beauty or desire; rather what matters is whether the suitor likes her and feels at ease with her. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) probably did not like this woman, or he did not feel any inclination to marry her, or there may have been other reasons.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/254065/what-is-meant-by-a-woman-offering-herself-to-a-man-and-is-that-permissible
283715,"I hope that you can save me from the punishment and wrath of Allah. I am a Muslim who had an Islamic upbringing and was raised with good morals and manners, and I am still viewed like that by others, but unfortunately I often give in to temptation and go to indecent websites and look at immoral images and videos on my phone, where people cannot see me. I know that Allah sees me, but every time I commit this immoral deed I do not only watch, but I also commit the secret habit. I am married and have children. I know that what I am doing is an animalistic action, when only Allah, may He be exalted can see me. I know that this action erases good deeds and even obliterates them. I pray and repent, and I remain patient for a day or two, then I go back to it again. I feel a strong and strange urge to open the phone and look at pictures and videos, and to commit that evil deed. I do not know what I should do. I know that if I die, I will go to hell, but I cannot control myself. Help me and save me, may Allah have mercy on you.","['Praise be to Allah.We understand what you are suffering of anguish because of what you are committing of sin and doing that repeatedly. This anguish is a good sign, as it indicates that even though you are sick in one way, in another way you are still healthy and there is still some good in you. The ultimate remedy for this problem can only be closing all the doors that lead you to disobey Allah; close every door that leads you to despair of the mercy of Allah. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Say, “O My servants who have transgressed against themselves [by sinning], do not despair of the mercy of Allah. Indeed, Allah forgives all sins. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful”}\xa0[az-Zumar 39:53]\n{ And those who do not invoke with Allah another deity or kill the soul which Allah has forbidden [to be killed], except by right, and do not commit unlawful sexual intercourse. And whoever should do that will meet a penalty.\nMultiplied for him is the punishment on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein humiliated,\nExcept for those who repent, believe and do righteous work. For them Allah will replace their evil deeds with good. And ever is Allah Forgiving and Merciful.\nAnd he who repents and does righteousness does indeed turn to Allah with [accepted] repentance}\xa0[al-Furqan 25:68-71].\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Jawab al-Kafi (p. 165):\nThe wisdom of Allah, may He be exalted, which is based on justice and grace has dictated that the one who repents from sin is like one who never sinned.\nAllah, may He be glorified, has guaranteed the one who repents from shirk, murder and zina that He will turn his bad deeds into good deeds. This is a general ruling which applies to everyone who repents from sin.\nAnd Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Say, “O My servants who have transgressed against themselves [by sinning], do not despair of the mercy of Allah. Indeed, Allah forgives all sins. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful”}\xa0[az-Zumar 39:53].\nNo sin is excluded from the general meaning of the verse, but it is particularly true in the case of those who repent. End quote.\nAllah, may He be exalted, has described the muttaqin (the pious, those who are mindful of Allah and fearHim) in His Book as being those who, if they commit major sins, or wrong themselves by committing minor sins, they remember the Almighty, the Oft-Forgiving, so they seek forgiveness for their sins and do not continue to do them or persist in sin.\nAllah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And hasten to forgiveness from your Lord and a garden as wide as the heavens and earth, prepared for the righteous,\nWho spend [in the cause of Allah] during ease and hardship and who restrain anger and who pardon the people - and Allah loves the doers of good,\nAnd those who, when they commit an immorality or wrong themselves [by transgression], remember Allah and seek forgiveness for their sins - and who can forgive sins except Allah? - and [who] do not persist in what they have done while they know.\nThose - their reward is forgiveness from their Lord and gardens beneath which rivers flow [in Paradise], wherein they will abide eternally; and excellent is the reward of the [righteous] workers}\xa0[Al ‘Imran 3:133-136].\nThe one who persists in sin is the one who commits it, then commits sin again, time after time, without repenting or seeking forgiveness.\nAs for the one who commits a sin, then repents soundly and sincerely from it, then weakens and goes back to sin again, then repents sincerely from it, and so on, is alternating between sin and disobedience, on the one hand, and repentance, regret and turning to the Most Merciful, the Most Gracious, on the other hand. There is the possibility that he will be pardoned by Allah, if Allah wills, and there is the hope that Allah will help him to overcome his problem and forgive him his sins.\nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “A man committed a sin and said: ‘My Lord, forgive me.’\nHis Lord said: ‘Did My slave know that he has a Lord Who forgives sin, and calls people to account for sin? I have forgiven My slave.’\nThen as much time as Allah willed passed, then he sinned again and said: ‘My Lord, I have sinned again; forgive me.’\n[Allah] said: ‘Did My slave know that he has a Lord Who forgives sin, and calls people to account for sin? I have forgiven My slave.’\nThen as much time as Allah willed passed, then he sinned again and said: ‘My Lord, I have sinned again; forgive me.’\n[Allah] said: ‘Did My slave know that he has a Lord Who forgives sin, and calls people to account for sin? I have forgiven My slave three times. Let him do what he wills.’”\nNarrated by al-Bukhari (7507 and Muslim (2758).\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Sharh Sahih Muslim (17/75):\nIf the sin is repeated a hundred times, or a thousand times or more, and he repents every time, his repentance will be accepted and his sins will be erased.\nIf he repents from all his sins in one go, after having committed them all, his repentance is valid.\nWhat is meant by the words of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, to the one who sinned repeatedly – “Do what you will, for I have forgiven you” – mean: so long as you sin, then repent, I will forgive you. End quote.\nSo continue to repent after every sin, and be sincere in your repentance, regretting and feeling sorry for what you have committed of sin in the past, and resolving to give it up forever.\nThen strive to perfect your repentance by doing the following:\nBlock all means that prompt you to commit this sin. This means not being alone; always be with other people, or with your wife and children.\nIf you must be away from your wife, try to bring her with you, and do not stay alone far away from your wife. Maintain your chastity with her, and help her to maintain her chastity.\nIf you are close to your wife and family, and are staying with them, then do not stay away from them. Endear yourself to your wife, and meet your needs with her. Every time you feel aroused as a result of looking at something, or as a result of an accidental glance, do not let the Shaytan prompt you to fulfil your desire in haram ways; rather hasten to do it in a halal way.\nConstantly keep yourself busy with beneficial actions, whether they have to do with this world or the hereafter, because idleness corrupts the individual in a big way.\nCompletely disconnect your phone from the Internet. It may be more beneficial for you to change your phone, and use a phone that has no access to the Internet.\nStrengthen your faith and your fear of Allah and His strict reckoning. Constantly bear in mind that He can see you and is watching you.\nRead Qur’an a great deal and offer a lot of supererogatory (nafil) prayers, especially voluntary prayers at night (qiyam al-layl).\nOffer a great deal of supplication for guidance, and one of the most beneficial supplications for guidance that a person can say is {Ihdina as-sirat al-mustaqim (Guide us to the straight path)}.\nFor more information on means that will help you to give up watching indecent films, please see the answer to question no. 210259 .\nWe ask Allah to guide us and you, and make us and you steadfast.\nAnd Allah is the One Who enables us to do that which He loves is pleased with.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/283715/he-commits-prohibited-acts-in-private-and-wants-advice
