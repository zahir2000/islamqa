189853,"I have an important, genuine and serious query. If you could please reply back ASAP that will be great and relieve me off the burden.
1) last Ramadan, my husband got weaken with his self-control(intercourse) and during the condition of fasting, we both did it. At that time, I didn’t know much in detail, so after Ramadan 20111 finished, we made up/compensated for our fasts & astaghfaar from Allah. I didn’t know about kaffara then.
2) this year Ramadan 2012, again during the condition of fasting, my husband ejaculated before doing the intercourse. I did prohibited him that we shouldn’t do it but obviously its something you have to exercise self control and control and put reins on your desires. I read much about it and still haven’t come to any conclusion.","['Praise be to Allah.Can you have intercourse while fasting?\nIt should be understood that intercourse during the day in Ramadan , for one who is fasting and is staying at home (i.e., not travelling), is a grave sin and what one must do is repent from it by praying a great deal for forgiveness, regretting it, acknowledging that it is a sin, and feeling sad for having done it.\xa0\nOne should also do a lot of acts of obedience and worship, and resolve not to go back to that sin.\xa0\nConsequences of having intercourse while fasting\nIn addition, there are five consequences of having intercourse while fasting:\xa0\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Incurring sin\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Rendering the fast invalid\n3.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Obligation to refrain from eating and drinking for the rest of the day\n4.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Obligation to make up the day when the fast was broken\n5.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Obligation of offering expiation (Kafarah)\xa0\nIn this case the expiation is severe: it is to free a slave; if that is not possible, then one must fast for two consecutive months; if he is not able to do that, then he must feed sixty poor persons.\xa0\nIt makes no difference whether ejaculation occurred or not, so long as intercourse took place.\xa0\nThat is different from the case if ejaculation occurred without intercourse ; in that case no expiation is required, but one still incurs sin, must refrain from eating and drinking for the rest of the day, and must make up that fast.\xa0\nWith regard to what it says in the question, “he ejaculated before doing the intercourse ”, if his penis entered his wife’s vagina, even if that was after ejaculation had occurred outside, then the severe expiation must also be offered in this case, because intercourse took place.\xa0\nIt says in Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah (35/55):\xa0\n“There is no difference of opinion among the jurists concerning the fact that expiation must be offered by anyone who has intercourse in the vagina during the day in Ramadan, deliberately and with no excuse, whether he ejaculates or not.”\xa0\nIn that case, the husband must offer expiation for every day on which he had intercourse. If intercourse occurred on the second occasion, then he must offer expiation twice.\xa0\nIf it was merely foreplay or thinking about intercourse , then when he ejaculated he felt lethargic and could not penetrate the vagina, then undoubtedly he was sinning by doing that, and he transgressed the limits set by Allah; he must repent, as must his wife if she took part willingly, but they only have to make up the day on which they broke the fast.\xa0\nIs ignorance of the punishment an excuse?\xa0\nIf a person is aware that intercourse during the day in Ramadan is prohibited, but he does not know that expiation is required for it, he must still offer expiation, because ignorance of the punishment is no excuse.\xa0\nExpiation for Breaking the Fast due to Intercourse\nThe expiation for intercourse during the day in Ramadan is one of three things, in this particular order. It is not the matter of choice, i.e., it is not permissible to move from one to another unless one is unable to do what is stipulated. They are: freeing a slave; if one cannot do that, then one must fast for two consecutive months; if he cannot do that, then he must feed sixty poor persons. It is not permissible for him to fast for two months if he can free a slave, and it is not permissible for him to feed sixty poor persons unless he is unable to do the first two actions, freeing a slave or fasting.\xa0\nThe scholars of the Committee said:\xa0\n“Expiation for intercourse during the day in Ramadan is done by doing one of the things mentioned above, in order of preference. One cannot move to fasting, for example, unless one is unable to free a slave; and one cannot move to feeding the poor unless one is unable to fast. If a person moves to feeding the poor because he is unable to free a slave or fast, it is permissible for him to offer iftar to sixty poor or needy persons who are fasting, giving them enough to eat their fill of the local staple food, once on his own account and once on behalf of his wife. Or he may give to 60 poor persons sixty Sa`s on his own behalf and on behalf of his wife, giving each one a Sa`, which is equivalent to approximately 3 kg.” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah (9/245)\xa0\nCan you delegate a charitable organisation to feed the poor on your behalf?\nIf the one who is obliged to offer this expiation has to feed the poor (because he is unable to do either of the first two actions listed), then there is nothing wrong with him delegating a trustworthy charitable organisation to feed the poor on his behalf, or distribute this food on his behalf to the poor.\xa0\nYou can also delegate your husband to offer the expiation on your behalf.\xa0\nCan you send the expiation to your homeland?\xa0\nThere is nothing wrong with sending the expiation to your original homeland, if the need there is greater because of the large numbers of poor people, as this may serve a greater purpose.\xa0\nIbn Muflih (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“It is permissible to transfer vows, expiation and bequests, according to the more correct scholarly opinion.” (Al-Furu` (4/265)\nThere is also no reason why your husband should not give this expiation on your behalf, if you consent to that.\xa0\nMust the wife offer expiation for breaking the fast due to intercourse?\nIf a man has intercourse with his wife during the day in Ramadan, one of two scenarios must be the case:\xa0\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 That at the time of intercourse the woman was excused because she was forced, or she forgot, or she was unaware of the prohibition on having intercourse during the day in Ramadan. In that case her fast is valid, and she does not have to make it up or offer expiation.\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 That she had no excuse; rather she willingly obeyed her husband in having intercourse. There is a difference of opinion among the scholars as to whether she is obliged to offer expiation in this case. The more correct view is that she is obliged to offer expiation in this case just as her husband is.\nDoes menses interrupt the sequence of the sixty-day expiation?\xa0\nIf the woman is obliged to fast for two consecutive months, and she starts to fast but then her menses comes , then that does not interrupt the sequence of her fasting . She should stop fasting (for the duration of her period), then make up the day’ missed while she was menstruating, and then complete the two months.\xa0\nThe same applies if she starts to fast then `Eid comes. She should stop fasting on the day of `Eid, then resume fasting immediately afterwards. Breaking the fast on the day of `Eid does not interrupt the sequence of fasts in the case of a fast offered as expiation.\xa0\nIs expiation waived if menses comes a few hours after breaking the fast by intercourse?\nIf a woman breaks her fast by having intercourse or otherwise, then she gets her menses a few hours after breaking the fast, the excuse of menses does not mean that the obligation to make up that day or offer expiation is waived, because she incurred the sin before the excuse came into effect; in other words, she did the forbidden action with no excuse, so the excuse does not have any impact on the ruling, just as it does not waive the burden of sin.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/189853/expiation-for-having-intercourse-during-daytime-in-ramadan
405768,"My husband suffers from chronic dizziness due to vestibular neuritis, and during Ramadan, his condition worsens with fasting, and he is unable to stand for the Salah of Fajr due to severe dizziness and loss of balance. During bouts of dizziness, he becomes almost unconscious, does not respond to me, and is unable to comprehend what I say. My husband is a student of knowledge, devout in his religion, and all praise is due to Allah, and it saddens him that he cannot perform Salah, especially during Ramadan. I try to help him with Wudu’, and he prays while lying down, but sometimes the call to Fajr prayer comes while he is in a state of major ritual impurity, and he is unable to perform Ghusl, so he does not pray Fajr until after the dizziness ends, and sometimes the attack lasts from Fajr until Maghrib when he breaks his fast, then he makes up the missed prayers afterward. Is it better for him to break his fast during the bouts of dizziness so that he can perform Salah on time? And if he experiences an attack while in a state of major ritual impurity, is it permissible for him to perform only Wudu’ and pray to avoid missing the prayer time, or should he wait until he is able to perform Ghusl? He always tells me that he cannot concentrate or have the proper reverence in his Salah during an attack. He is confused about what to do; should he wait until the bout of dizziness ends, or should he continue to pray while lying down to preserve the prayer time?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIf fasting increases the likelihood of your husband experiencing dizziness, or prolongs its duration or intensity, then it is permissible for him to break his fast when he feels an onset of dizziness, and also to break the fast after the onset if it alleviates his condition.\nAllah the Exalted says (translation of the meaning): {O you who have believed, decreed upon you is fasting as it was decreed upon those before you that you may become righteous - [Fasting for] a limited number of days. So whoever among you is ill or on a journey [during them] - then an equal number of days [are to be made up].} (Al-Baqarah 2:183-184)\nThe illness that permits breaking the fast is one that causes evident hardship to the fasting person.\nAn-Nawawi said in ""Al-Majmu\'"" (6/261): ""The ill person who is unable to fast due to an illness that is hoped to pass is not obliged to fast... This is if he experiences evident hardship by fasting. It is not required that he reaches a state where he is unable to fast, but our companions have said: The condition for permitting breaking the fast is that he experiences hardship by fasting that is difficult to bear."" End quote.\nSheikh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: ""The sick person has different states:\nThe first: He is not affected by fasting, such as a minor cold, a slight headache, toothache, and the like, so it is not permissible for him to break the fast, although some Jurists say: It is permissible for him due to the generality of the verse {So whoever among you is ill} [Al-Baqarah 2:185], but we say: This ruling is qualified by a reason, which is that breaking the fast relieves a burden from him, so then we tell him to break the fast. But if he is not affected, then it is not permissible for him to break the fast and he must fast.\nThe second state: If fasting is difficult for him but does not harm him, then it is disliked for him to fast, and it is recommended for him to break the fast.\nThe third state: If fasting is difficult for him and harms him, like a person suffering from kidney disease or (certain types of) diabetes, and the like, then fasting for him is prohibited."" End quote from ""Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti\'"" (6/341).\nSecondly:\nIf he experiences a bout of dizziness while in a state of major ritual impurity, it is obligatory for him to perform Ghusl for Salah, and it is permissible for him to combine Dhuhr and `Asr, and Maghrib and `Isha, either by bringing them forward or delaying them. If the bout continues and he fears the time for Fajr, `Asr, or `Isha will expire, it is permissible for him to perform Tayammum; because he is sick and unable to use water, and he only delays the Salah to the end of its time in the hope that the bout will pass.\nThirdly:\nA person is required to pray standing, but if he cannot, then sitting, and if he cannot, then on his side; as reported by Al-Bukhari (1050) from `Imran ibn Husayn (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: ""I had hemorrhoids, so I asked the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) about the Salah, and he said: \'Pray standing, if you cannot, then sitting, and if you cannot, then on your side.\'""\nIt is not permissible for him to delay the Salah beyond its time except in the case of combining prayers.\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in ""Majmu` Al-Fatawa"" (24/14): ""The sick person and the one with continuous bleeding (mustahadah) may combine prayers.""

190411,One of my close friends committed Zina during the day in Ramadan with a non-Muslim young man when she was twenty years old. Now she is twenty-nine and is very sad about what she did. She wants to know what exactly she should do so that that mistake may be forgiven.,"['Praise be to Allah.Is Zina a major sin?\nThere is no doubt that Zina (fornication or adultery) is a major sin and is something that incurs the wrath and anger of Allah. If Zina was committed with a non-Muslim, the sin is greater, and if that was during the day in Ramadan , that is even worse. If the person who committed the sin does not repent sincerely from the bottom of his heart, then his loss is complete.\xa0\nAllah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And those who invoke not any other Ilah (god) along with Allah, nor kill such life as Allah has forbidden, except for just cause, nor commit illegal sexual intercourse and whoever does this shall receive the punishment. The torment will be doubled to him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein in disgrace; Except those who repent and believe (in Islamic Monotheism), and do righteous deeds , for those, Allah will change their sins into good deeds, and Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” [Al-Furqan 25:68-70]\n“Say: O My slaves who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allah, verily Allah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” [Az-Zumar 39:53]\nDespite the abhorrent nature and severity of Zina and the fact that the one who committed it is exposed to the wrath and anger of Allah, the mercy of Allah precedes His wrath, so He does not hasten to punish His slave; rather He opens to him the gate of repentance and gives him time to repent. If he repents and is sincere , Allah will forgive him, no matter what his sin was.\xa0\nWhat this young woman must do is be sincere towards Allah in her repentance, regret having committed this abhorrent action , resolve never to commit this sin again, and do a lot of righteous deeds. She should turn to her Lord, thinking positively of Him, being sincere towards Him and repenting fully to Him. Allah accepts the repentance of His slaves and grants pardon for bad deeds.\xa0\nWhat happens if you commit Zina in Ramadan?\nThe one who committed Zina during the day in Ramadan has to, along with repenting, make up that day’s fast and offer the severe expiation , which is to free a slave; if he cannot do that, then he must fast for two consecutive months; and if he cannot do that, he must feed sixty poor persons.\xa0\nThe one who committed Zina several years ago and has not made up the fasts that he missed also, in addition to the above, has to offer expiation for delaying the making up of that day’s fast, which is to feed one poor person; the amount to be given is half a Sa` of the local staple food, wheat or rice and so on. That is equivalent to one and a half kilograms.\xa0\nThe Standing Committee was asked:\xa0\nWhat is the ruling on one who committed Zina during the day in Ramadan? That took place at the time when he was ignorant and now he is asking Allah for forgiveness.\xa0\nThey replied:\xa0\n“The questioner has to repent and must offer expiation, which is to free a slave; if he cannot do that, then he must fast for two consecutive months; if he cannot do that, then he has to feed sixty poor persons. He also has to make up the fast of that day on which he broke the fast, and he has to offer expiation for the delay in making up that day’s fast, which is one and a half kilograms of wheat.” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 9/255)\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/190411/what-happens-if-you-commit-zina-in-ramadan
