221997,"My mother got her period, then she became pure after seven days, as usual, then one week later, she got her period again. Is this regarded as menses? Should she pray and fast? Please note that she takes measures to prevent that and she is approximately forty-eight years old. Should she continue not to pray throughout the two periods, even if they add up to more than fifteen days?","['Praise be to Allah.The scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) differed regarding the minimum duration of the state of purity between two menses. We have stated previously that there is no minimum duration of the state of purity between two menses, so if a woman’s period comes to her after the previous period, then she is menstruating, whether the time between the two menses was long or short.\nPlease see the answers to questions no. 37828 and 20898 .\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAs for the minimum duration of the state of purity between two menses, it was said that the minimum is thirteen days, and it was said that there is no minimum, just as there is no maximum, and this view is the one that is correct.\nBased on this correct view, it is possible for a woman to menstruate twice in one month, but the woman should know that menstrual blood is what is menses, whereas the other kind of blood, which is thin and yellowish, is not menses; rather it is irregular bleeding (Istihadah). (End quote from Fatawa Nur `ala Ad-Darb by Ibn `Uthaymin).\nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 5595 .\nBased on that, with regard to what happened to your mother after one week, if its characteristics were those of menstrual blood, then it was menses.\nWith regard to the two menses lasting beyond fifteen days in the case of one who menstruates twice in a month, that does not matter. There are some women who menstruate for sixteen or seventeen days of every month, and that is their normal, regular pattern.\nIbn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: There is no minimum or maximum duration (for menses). Rather what a woman sees as her normal, regular pattern is menses. If it so happens that it lasts for less than a day and that is her regular pattern, then it is menses. If it so happens that it lasts for seventeen days and that is her regular pattern, then it is menses.\nBut if the bleeding is continuous, then it is known that this is not menses, because it is known from Islamic teachings and from linguistic usage that a woman is sometimes pure (not menstruating) and is sometimes menstruating, so there are rulings for her period of purity and there are rulings for her menses. (End quote from Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 19/237)\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhat is meant by “its maximum is fifteen days” is the maximum duration of menses. This is the view of the madhhab and they quoted as evidence what is typically the case; it is typically the case that a woman’s menses does not exceed fifteen days. Moreover, anything beyond this time would take up the greater part of the month, and it is not possible for the period of purity to be shorter than the duration of menses.\nSo if it is sixteen days, then the period of purity would be fourteen days, and it cannot be the case that the bleeding lasts for longer than the period of purity…\nHowever, the correct view is that there is no maximum duration of menses, because there are women for whom the regular pattern is seventeen days, or sixteen days. What is it that makes the blood before sunset on the fifteenth day menses and the blood one minute after sunset irregular bleeding (Istihadah), even though the nature, colour and abundance of the flow are the same? So how can it be said that within the space of one or two minutes the blood turns from menses to irregular bleeding with no evidence? If there was any evidence to support what they say, we would accept it.\nSo if the woman has a normal, regular pattern of seventeen days, for example, we say that it is all menses.\nBut if the bleeding continues for the entire month, or it stops briefly, such as for a day or two, or it is intermittent, so it comes for a few hours and stops for a few hours throughout the month, then this is irregular bleeding (Istihadah).\n(End quote from Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti`, 1/471-472).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/221997/she-got-her-period-twice-in-one-month-and-the-two-periods-together-added-up-to-more-than-fifteen-days
20803,What is the reward for becoming a Hafidh?,"['Praise be to Allah.The Elevated Status of Memorising the Quran in the Hereafter\nWhoever memorises the Quran and acts upon it, Allah will reward him and honour him greatly for that, so that he will rise in status in Paradise to a level commensurate with what he memorised of the Book of Allah.\nAt-Tirmidhi (2914) and Abu Dawud (1464) narrated from `Abdullah ibn `Amr that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “It will be said to the companion of the Quran: Recite and rise in status, recite as you used to recite in the world, for your status will be at the last verse that you recite.” This Hadith was classed as authentic by Al-Albani in As-Silsilah As-Sahihah, 5/218, no. 2240, after which he said:\xa0\nNote that what is meant by the “companion of the Quran” is the one who memorises it by heart , as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “The one who knows more Quran should lead the people in prayer,” meaning the one who has memorised the most.\xa0 The differentiation in status in Paradise will depend on how much was memorised in this world, not how much one will recite on that day as some people imagine. This clearly points to the virtue of the Hafdh who has memorised the Quran , but that is subject to the condition that he memorises it for the sake of Allah, not for worldly purposes or financial gain. Otherwise the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Most of the hypocrites of my Ummah are among those who have memorised the Quran.”\xa0\nThe Virtue of the Quran Memorizer\nConcerning the virtue of the Hafidh who memorises the Quran , Al-Bukhari (4937) narrated from `A’ishah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The likeness of the one who reads Quran and memorises it is that he is with the righteous honourable scribes. The likeness of the one who reads it and tries hard to memorise it even though it is difficult for him, he will have two rewards.”\xa0\nFor the Hafidh who has memorised the Quran , praying Qiyam Al-Layl is easy. And the Quran will intercede for him on the Day of Resurrection, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Fasting and the Quran will intercede for a person on the Day of Resurrection. Fasting will say, `O Lord, I deprived him of food and desires during the day, so let me intercede for him.’ The Quran will say, `O Lord I deprived him of his sleep at night, so let me intercede for him.’ Then they will both intercede for him.” (Narrated by Ahmad, At-Tabarani and Al-Hakim; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Al-Jami’, no. 3882)\xa0\nIt should be noted here that there is a weak Hadith that is quoted concerning the virtue of memorising the Quran. This Hadith says, “The bearer of the Quran, if he regards what it permits as permissible and what it forbids as forbidden, he will intercede for ten of his family members on the Day of Resurrection, all of whom deserved to enter Hell.” (Narrated by Al-Bayhaqi in Shu`ab Al-Iman (The Branches of Faith) from Jabir; it was classed as inauthentic by Al-Albani in Da`ief Al-Jami`)\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20803/reward-for-memorising-quran
514686,Is it permissible to respond to a person who says “Welcome” by saying “May Paradise welcome you”? Is it valid to say this?,"['Praise be to Allah.When someone says “welcome” (or “hello”), you should say something similar or better than it, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {When you are given a greeting, respond with a better greeting, or [at least] with the like thereof. Verily, Allah takes careful account of all things} [an-Nisa’ 4:86].\nThe phrase translated from Arabic here may be translated as a statement (“Paradise will welcome you”); this it is a lie and it is not permissible to say it.\nBut if it is by way of supplication (“May Paradise welcome you”) – which is what appears to be the case – praying that Paradise will welcome him, we do not know that Paradise itself will welcome those who will enter it. Rather the angels will welcome the people of Paradise, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Those who feared their Lord will be ushered to paradise in groups until, when they reach it, they will find its gates wide open, and its keepers will say to them: Peace be upon you; you have done well, so enter it, to abide herein forever}\xa0[az-Zumar 39:73].\nAnd Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{gardens of perpetual abode, which they will enter together with the righteous among their forebears, their spouses, and their offspring. Angels will enter unto them from every gate [saying]:\nPeace be upon you because you patiently persevered. How excellent is the ultimate end!}\xa0[ar-Ra‘d 13:23-24]\n{The greatest terror will not grieve them; and the angels will welcome them [saying]: This is your day, that you were promised}\xa0[al-Anbiya’ 21:103].\nMatters of the unseen are tawqeefi [meaning that they are to be based on the religious texts of the Qur’an and saheeh Sunnah, and are not subject to ijtihad], and cannot be spoken of except on the basis of evidence.\nAs there is no evidence to prove that Paradise will welcome its people, it is better not to say that, because there is the fear that this may be overstepping the mark in supplication.\nAbu Dawud (96), Ibn Majah (3894) and Ahmad narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn Mughaffal heard his son saying: O Allah, I ask You for the white palace on the right-hand side of Paradise, if I enter it. He said: O my son, ask Allah for Paradise and seek refuge with Him from Hell, for I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “There will be people in this ummah who will overstep the mark in purification and supplication.” This hadith was classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud.\nTherefore you should not say that, and you should use the well-known words of greeting and welcoming people.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/514686/what-is-the-ruling-on-greeting-a-person-by-saying-may-paradise-welcome-you
5163,Does iddah imply when it is the woman who is seeking the divorce (khul`)?,"['Praise be to Allah.What is Khul`?\nKhul` – in principle – can only occur at the request of the wife, and with the husband’s subsequent agreement to end the marriage.\xa0\nWhen does `Iddah become obligatory?\n`Iddah is obligatory upon every woman who leaves her husband, or whose husband leaves her, whether the cause is divorce, annulment of the marriage or the death of the husband, except when the divorce occurs before the marriage has been consummated, in which case the woman does not have to observe `Iddah, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“O you who believe! When you marry believing women, and then divorce them before you have sexual intercourse with them, no `Iddah [divorce prescribed period] have you to count in respect of them” [Al-Ahzab 33:49]\xa0\nIs `Iddah Necessary after Khul`?\nWith regard to the `Iddah following Khul`, the correct scholarly view is that it is one menstrual cycle, as is indicated by the Sunnah.\xa0\nIt was narrated from Ibn `Abbas that the wife of Thabit ibn Qays ended her marriage to her husband by means of Khul` at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded her to observe an `Iddah of one menstrual cycle. (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 1185 and Abu Dawud, 2229. It was also narrated by An-Nasa’i (3497) from the Hadith of Ar-Rabi` bint `Afra’. The two Hadiths were both classed as authentic by Ibn Al-Qayyim, as we shall see below).\xa0\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\nIn the fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded the woman who ended her marriage to her husband by Khul` to observe an `Iddah of one menstrual cycle, there is evidence for two rulings:\xa0\nThe first is that she does not have to wait for three menstrual cycles, rather one menstrual cycle is sufficient. Just as this is clearly the Sunnah, it was also the view of Amir Al-Mu’minin `Uthman ibn `Affan, `Abdullah ibn `Umar ibn Al-Khattab, Ar-Rabi’ bint Mu`awwadh and her paternal uncle, who was one of the greatest Companions. We do not know of anyone who held a different opinion, as Al-Layth ibn Sa`d narrated that Nafi` the freed slave of Ibn `Umar heard Al-Rabi` bint Mu`awwadh ibn `Afra’ telling\xa0 `Abdullah ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that she had ended her marriage to her husband by Khul` at the time of `Uthman ibn `Affan, and her paternal uncle had come to `Uthman ibn `Affan and said, The daughter of Mu`awwadh ended her marriage to her husband by Khul` today, so should she move (from the marital home)?\xa0 `Uthman said, She should move, and there is no inheritance between them, and she does not have to observe any `Iddah, but she should not remarry until one menstrual cycle has passed, lest she be pregnant. `Abdullah ibn `Umar said: and `Uthman was the best of us and the most knowledgeable.\xa0\nThis view was also shared by Is-haq ibn Rahawayh and Imam Ahmad, according to one report narrated from him. It was also the view favoured by Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah.\xa0\nThose who supported this view said: this is in accordance with the principles of Shari`ah. The `Iddah (in the case of divorce) was made three menstrual cycles in order to lengthen the time during which the husband may take back his wife, so that the husband will have enough time to rethink the matter and to be able to take his wife back during this time.\xa0\nBut in the case of Khul`, the wife is not going to go back and the purpose is simply to establish whether she is pregnant or not, so one menstrual cycle is sufficient. They said: this does not contradict the ruling that the `Iddah for a woman divorced by Talaq is three months. In the case of divorce the `Iddah is the same whether it is a final divorce or a revocable divorce .” (\xa0Zad Al-Ma`ad, 5/196, 197)\n\xa0Some scholars said that the `Iddah for a woman who ends her marriage to her husband by Khul` is three menstrual cycles, as in the case of one who is divorced by Talaq , but this was expertly refuted by Imam Ibn Al-Qayyim, who said:\n“What indicates that Khul` is not the same as divorce is the fact that in the case of a revocable divorce after consummation of the marriage, there are specific rulings which are not applicable in the case of Khul`.\n\nThat the husband has more right to take her back.\nWhen the husband issues a divorce, is it counted as one of three, and after the third it is not permissible for the wife to go back to him until she has been married to another man and that marriage has been consummated.\n`Iddah in the case of divorce is three menstrual cycles.\n\n\xa0So the `Iddah in the case of Khul` is what is indicated by the Sunnah, namely one menstrual cycle.\n\xa0And Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/5163/is-iddah-necessary-after-khul
