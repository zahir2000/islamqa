408136,"My friend asks me saying: I experienced a wet dream during the day in Ramadan, and while feeling I may climax, I stopped myself, so as not to invalidate the fast, and I said: Since I stopped myself, there is no need for a full ritual bath, and I did not pay attention to my clothes, whether they were wet or not, and I completely forgot about the matter. After a few days, I remembered again, and when I went back to the clothes in the washing machine, I found yellow discharges with an unpleasant smell, which I assumed were from vaginal infections; because this usually happens to me, and I completed my acts of worship, but doubt still kills me. The question is: Do I need to perform a full ritual bath? Did I have an ejaculation? Do I need to repeat what I have fasted? And if I perform a full ritual bath with the intention of purification from major ritual impurity, do I need to repeat the acts of worship I have performed, and if I do not perform a full ritual bath, do I need to repeat the acts of worship I have done? I want to ask the people of knowledge so that I may be certain of my affair, and for your information, I do not know the difference in smell between palm pollen; because I have never smelled it before, and I get confused if it is the smell of dough, or my discharges from the infections.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nNocturnal emission and the release of semen during sleep do not invalidate fasting, and it is not appropriate for a person to restrain themselves from ejaculation during a nocturnal emission, as it may be harmful.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in ""Al-Mughni"" (3/128): ""If one has a nocturnal emission, it does not invalidate his fast, because it is not by choice, and it is similar to if something enters his throat while he is sleeping."" End quote from Al-Mughni.\nSecondly:\nIf the situation is as you described, with restraining oneself from ejaculation during sleep, and the discharge has an unpleasant smell, and the person in question suffers from vaginal infections, then it appears that this is not semen; because the smell of semen is not unpleasant; it is like the smell of date palm pollen or dough.\nTherefore, she is not required to perform Ghusl (full ritual bath), nor is she required to repeat any of the Salah (formal prayers).\nHowever, if she takes precautionary measures, performs Ghusl, and repeats the prayers she performed after that sleep, it is better for her and will protect her from obsessive doubts.\nAs for fasting, it is valid even if semen has been discharged.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/408136/holding-back-ejaculation-then-seeing-discharge-with-a-bad-odour
1046,What is the proof that women have to cover their feet during prayer for prayer to be accepted?,"['Praise be to Allah.The free woman who has attained the age of maturity is obliged to cover her entire body during prayer , apart from her face and hands, because all of her body is `Awrah. If she prays and any part of her `Awrah becomes uncovered , such as a shin or foot or all or part of her head, then her prayer is invalid, because the Prophet said:\n""Allah will not accept the prayer of a woman who has started to menstruate, except with a Khimar (covering)"" (Reported by Ahmad, Abu Dawud, Ibn Majah and At-Tirmidhi, with an authentic chain of narration)\nAbu Dawud reported from Umm Salamah\xa0(may Allah be pleased with her) that she asked the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) about a woman who prayed wearing a Dir’ (chemise or upper garment) and a Khimar (head cover), but no Izar (lower garment). He said: ""The woman is `Awrah.""\nAs for the face, the Sunnah is to uncover it during prayer , so long as no Non-Mahram men are present.\xa0\nAccording to the majority of scholars, the feet must be covered ; some scholars allow uncovering the feet but the majority say the opposite.\xa0\nAbu Dawud reported from Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) that she was asked about a woman who prayed in a Khimar and Qamis (dress or gown). She said, ""There is nothing wrong with it if the Dir’ (chemise) covers her feet."" In any case, it is better to cover the feet, to be on the safe side.\nAs far as the hands are concerned, there is more leeway: there is nothing wrong with either covering them or uncovering them, although some scholars think that it is better to cover them.\nAnd Allah is the Source of strength.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1046/does-a-woman-have-to-cover-her-feet-when-praying
445870,What is the ruling on using a derma pen while fasting?,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe Dermapen is a small, portable device similar to a pen, consisting of several sterile fine needles that puncture the skin and cause what is known as a dermal shock with the aim of treating various skin diseases and disorders. Therefore, the term Dermapen is derived from the word Dermatology and Pen.\nThe Dermapen belongs to the microneedling technique, which is a procedure that uses small needles to puncture the skin for therapeutic purposes, to enhance collagen production and the formation of new skin tissue for fresher and smoother skin, and to treat multiple skin problems.\nThe Dermapen is distinguished by being a portable cylinder that does not hinder or restrict movement, and it is a device with adjustable depth so that it is not too deep in sensitive areas, and the surgical needles can be disposed of after the session for the safety of the patient.\nThe Dermapen consists of 12 fine needles that puncture the upper layer of the skin.\nThe skin responds by healing itself by enhancing the production of collagen and elastin in the treated area, which stimulates the growth of new tissues that treat various skin problems and gives the face freshness and smoothness.\nSee:\nDermapen for the face: Your comprehensive guide - Webteb (webteb.com)\nSecondly:\nThere is no objection to using this technique if it is free from harm; because the basic principle is permissibility.\nSee what we have presented on the ruling on the use of the Dermaroller, in the answer to question number (323723 )\nThirdly:\nThe use of the Dermapen and the Dermaroller has no effect on fasting; because nothing enters the body through the skin, let alone reaches the cavity, and no blood comes out to be compared with cupping for those who deem the fast invalidated by it.\nPuncturing the skin with needles is not something that invalidates the fast, nor do injections with needles invalidate the fast, unless the injection is with a nourishing liquid.\nIt is stated in the resolution of the Islamic Fiqh Academy regarding matters that invalidate the fast:\n""The following matters are not considered to invalidate the fast: ...\n8- Therapeutic injections, whether subcutaneous, intramuscular, or intravenous, except for nourishing fluids and injections...\n11- Things that enter the body through absorption from the skin such as fats, ointments, and therapeutic skin patches loaded with medicinal or chemical substances.\n12- Inserting a catheter (a fine tube) into the arteries for imaging or treating the heart vessels or other organs.\n13- Inserting an endoscope through the abdominal wall to examine the viscera or perform surgery on them.\n14- Taking samples (biopsies) from the liver or other organs unless accompanied by the administration of solutions...\n16- The entry of any instrument or therapeutic materials into the brain or spinal cord.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/445870/using-derma-pen-during-fasting
170025,"If Iblis was not one of the angels, why was he commanded to prostrate to Adam along with the angels?","['Praise be to Allah.Undoubtedly, when Allah, may He be Exalted, commanded the angels to prostrate to Adam , this command was also addressed to Iblis, as Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“…except Iblis (Satan), he refused to be of those who prostrate.(Allah) said: `What prevented you (O Iblis) that you did not prostrate, when I commanded you?’” (Al-A`raf 7:11-12]\xa0\nThe scholars have spoken about the reason why the command to prostrate to Adam was addressed to Iblis even though he was not one of the angels ; they stated that the reason for that was that he was similar to the angels in their outward deeds.\xa0\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said (1/105):\xa0\nThe conclusion is that when Allah, may He be Exalted, commanded the angels to prostrate to Adam, He included Iblis in that because, even though he was not one of them , he was imitating them and doing deeds like theirs. Hence he was included in what was addressed to them, and he was condemned for going against the command.”\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Tafsir Surat Al-Baqarah (1/127):\xa0\n“If someone were to say: there is something confusing in this verse, which is that when Allah, may He be Exalted, says that He commanded the angels to prostrate, He says that they all prostrated except Iblis, and it would appear to mean that Iblis was one of them, but that is not the case.\xa0\nThe answer to that is that Iblis shared with them their outward deeds, so the command included him on the basis of his outward deeds.”\nSomething similar was also said by At-Tahir ibn `Ashur (may Allah have mercy on him) in his Tafsir, At-Tahrir wat-Tanwir (1/409).\xa0\nWhat we are obliged to believe is that the command to prostrate to Adam was addressed to Iblis just as it was addressed to the angels, and this is what the Quran clearly says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“(Allah) said: `What prevented you (O Iblis) that you did not prostrate, when I commanded you?’” [Al-A`raf 7:12]\xa0\nAs for the reason why this command was addressed to him, Allah knows best.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/170025/why-was-iblis-commanded-to-prostrate-to-adam
