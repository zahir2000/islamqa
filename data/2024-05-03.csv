388957,"when the quran states that mankind and jinn cannot bring something like the Quran for even 3 verses, what is the explanation for Surah Jinn which quotes Jinn for 15 verses?","['Praise be to Allah.The Quran is the Speech of Allah, spoken by Him with His letters and meanings, as He, the Exalted, said (translation of the meaning): {And if any one of the polytheists seeks your protection, then grant him protection so that he may hear the Words of Allāh [i.e., the Quran]. Then deliver him to his place of safety. That is because they are a people who do not know.}\xa0(At-Tawbah:6).\nIn the Quran, there are statements of various peoples that Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, has mentioned, including the believers like the prophets and the truthful, and the disbelievers, like Pharaoh and Qarun, and the hypocrites, as well as the angels, the jinn, the birds like the hoopoe, the ants, and others.\nThe purpose of mentioning these statements is to convey the meaning and not necessarily the exact wording. Sometimes the conveyed message is the exact wording, and sometimes it is the meaning, especially if it is impossible for it to be the exact wording, such as when the speaker is not speaking in Arabic. This has been explicitly stated by more than one of the scholars:\nZain Ad-Din Ar-Razi Al-Hanafi said in ""Questions and Answers on the Oddities of the Verses of Revelation"" (p. 144): ""If it is asked: How did Allah, the Exalted, narrate here the speech of the sorcerers who believed and of Pharaoh (translation of the meaning): {They said, \'We believe in the Lord of the worlds\'} to the saying of Allah: {And cause us to die as Muslims}, then narrated this meaning in Surah Taha and Surah Ash-Shu`ara with additions and omissions in the words attributed to them, when this event only occurred once, so how did their expression differ in it?\nWe say: The answer to this is that they spoke in their language, not in Arabic, and Allah, the Exalted, narrated that from them in Arabic several times, for a wisdom that necessitated repetition and reiteration, which we will explain in Surah Ash-Shu`ara, Allah willing. So, at one time He narrated it matching their wording in the translation, taking care of the wording, and after that, He narrated it by meaning, following the custom of the Arabs in varying speech and differing in their styles; so as not to bore if it was merely repetitive."" End quote.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in ""At-Tis`iniyyah"" (2/464): ""Indeed, the letters and sounds that Moses heard were Hebrew, and those that Allah mentioned about him in the Quran were Arabic. If speech were merely letters and sounds, there would be no commonality at all between the speech that Moses heard and that which Allah mentioned that he heard. Thus, reporting that he heard these sounds, which he did not hear, would be a lie.\nLikewise, all those whom Allah narrated in the Quran that they spoke from the previous nations who spoke languages other than Arabic, they spoke in their languages, and Allah narrated that in the language in which the Quran was revealed, which is Arabic. And the Speech of Allah is truth. If their speech was just letters and sounds, and the letters and sounds they said are not like these, then it would not be possible to narrate from them at all. Rather, their speech was letters and meanings, so Allah narrated that from them in another language, and the letters follow the meanings, and the meanings are the main intended purpose, as the speech of all creatures is translated."" End quote.\nAt-Tahir said: ""The meaning of the statement here is: to convey their intention to those they want to reach among their kind, in the manner in which they understand each other,"" At-Tahrir wat-Tanwir (29/220).\nAnd he said: ""This is narrated from the speech of the jinn,"" At-Tahrir wat-Tanwir (29/222).\nIn summary, what this ignorant objector mentioned only demonstrates his ignorance, narrow-mindedness, and poor understanding.\nIf Allah\'s narration of the speech of the jinn or humans, whether believers or disbelievers, in His Book, meant that those whom Allah narrated from them said ""Quran,"" then that would mean that all these humans, and the jinn, had brought forth a Quran from themselves, and then Allah transmitted this Quran in ""His Quran""; then He challenged them to produce something like it.\nThis could not be from the weakest of people in intellect; rather, it is only imagined and found problematic by someone who is ignorant, who does not know the places of argument, and the aspects of speech.\nAnd it is astonishing that anyone would believe such nonsense, be disturbed by it, and think there is a real problem!!\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/388957/quranic-challenge-to-the-jinn
212022,“Part of honoring the deceased is to bury him”– does the word deceased include even animals because I buried an animal of mine when I heard this Hadith?,"['Praise be to Allah.Is ‘Honouring the deceased means burying him’ a Hadith?\n“Honouring the deceased means burying him” is not a Hadith; rather these are the words of one of the jurists. (See Mukhtasar Khalil by Al-Kharashi, 2/91)\xa0\nAs-Sakhkhawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Maqasid Al-Hasanah (p. 141):\xa0\n“I did not find the Hadith “Honouring the deceased means burying him ” in any report attributed to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Rather it was narrated by Ibn Abu Ad-Dunya in his Kitab Al-Mawt, via Ayyub As-Sakhtiyani. He said: ‘It was said that a sign of honouring the deceased on the part of his family is their hastening to bury him.’”\xa0\nBut the meaning is correct and is in accordance with the Sunnah.\xa0\nShould animals be buried when they die?\nWe do not say concerning an animal, when it dies, that part of honouring it is burying it, as we say about human beings. But if burying an animal will ward off harm from the Muslims, then it is prescribed to do so, because burying it in that case comes under the heading of removing something harmful from the road used by the Muslims.\xa0\nIf the Muslims will be harmed by an animal when it dies and bothered by its smell, then it is obligatory to bury it or take it far away from the highways and byways used by the people. Hence it is prescribed to bury it, in order to ward off harm from the Muslims, not just because it has died.\xa0\nAl-Bukhari (1492) and Muslim (363) narrated that Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: A sheep was given in charity to a freed slave woman of Maymunah, but it died. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) passed by it and said: “Why don’t you take its hide and tan it, and make use of it?” They said: It is dead, O Messenger of Allah (i.e., it died of natural causes and was not slaughtered properly). He said: “It is only prohibited to eat it.”\xa0\nSo he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) encouraged them to make use of its hide, and he did not tell them to bury it.\xa0\nThe scholars of the Standing Committee were asked about vermin and animals and so on; should they be buried, or left unburied on the ground?\xa0\nThey replied:\xa0\n“The matter is broad in scope, because there is no text in Shari`ah to indicate that it is prescribed to bury them or to forbid doing so. But it is preferable to bury them so that they will not harm or bother anyone.” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 8/444-445)\xa0\nFor more details, please refer to the following answers: 11437 , 14404 , 146155 , and 119652 .\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/212022/should-animals-be-buried-when-they-die

And from it: ""He Raqamah the garment (Nasr): he patterned it, and the merchant Raqamah (marks) his garment with his brand, and he Raqamah (marked) the book: he dotted it and clarified its letters with its diacritical marks.

244237,"We live in an area that is pretty secluded and as such, it is frequented by many dangerous and venomous snakes.","['Praise be to Allah.The Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) enjoined the killing of snakes , and this is general in meaning and applies to all kinds of snakes, in any place. But if the snake is inside the house, it should not be killed until it has been warned three times; that is because of the possibility that it may be a jinn . Then if it appears after that, it may be killed.\nIt was narrated from Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that he heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) address the people from the pulpit, saying: “Kill snakes.”\n`Abdullah ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “After that, I would not leave any snake that I saw but I would kill it.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 3299 and Muslim, 3233)\nAbu Dawud (5249) narrated that Ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Kill all the snakes, and whoever fears their revenge does not belong to me.” (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud)\nMuslim (2233) narrated that Nafi` (may Allah have mercy on him) said: One day `Abdullah ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) was at a ruin of his, when he saw the flash of a small snake. He said: Find this snake and kill it. Abu Lubabah Al-Ansari s(may Allah be pleased with him) aid: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbid killing the small snakes that live in houses, except the short-tailed snake and the one with two stripes, for they are the ones that cause blindness and miscarriages.\nAnd Muslim (2236) narrated that Abu As-Sa’ib said: We entered upon Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri, and whilst we were sitting there, we heard a movement beneath the bed. We looked and saw a snake… and he quoted the Hadith, in which it says: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “These houses have inhabitants. If you see any of them, ask them to leave for three days. If it goes (all well and good), otherwise kill it, for it is a Kafir.”\nIbn `Abd Al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Some scholars said: It is not essential for snakes to be warned or urged or asked to leave except in Madinah only. Others said that Madinah and other places are the same in that regard, because some snakes are jinn and may be found in Madinah and elsewhere, and whoever among them Allah wills may be Muslim. Malik said: What I prefer is that the snakes that are found in houses, in Madinah and elsewhere, should be warned for three days, but snakes should not be warned if they are found in the desert.”\nIbn `Abd Al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“It is preferable that all snakes that are found in houses should be warned, as Malik said. What is meant by warning is that the person who sees a snake in his house should say: I urge you, O snake, not to appear before us or harm us.” (At-Tamhid, 16/263)\nIbn `Abd Al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“The scholars unanimously agreed that it is permissible to kill desert snakes, whether they are small or large, no matter what type they are.” (At-Tamhid, 16/28)\nSo there is nothing wrong with you killing snakes that are outside the house. As for those that are found inside the house, they should not be killed until they have been warned for three days.\nWith regard to the view that killing the jinn that appear in the form of snakes brings bad luck, this is a false view for which there is no basis.\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 1239 , 21901 , 8814 , 2896 , 8804 , and 127221 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/244237/is-killing-snakes-allowed-in-islam
