459431,"My brother and I spend on the household. My father is present but his income is low, and is only sufficient to cover his cigarettes, a few items for the house, water and bread. As for bills, extending our residency permits, expenses and traffic fines, all of that is paid for half-and-half between me and my brother. My aim in contributing is to keep the household running, limit problems, try to stop my brother’s complaints and try to maintain a good standard of living. My question is: my mother has decided to refuse intimacy with my father and not show him any respect, speak any kind word to him or have any relationship with him, on the grounds that he does not spend on her. Does she have the right to do that? Please note that she lacks for nothing and her life is better than it was. Is this regarded as being ungrateful to her husband for kind treatment, because when we were small he used to spend on us, until I reached the age of 19 and my brother reached the age of 23-24? But my mother does not give him any credit for what he already spent.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt is obligatory for a man to spend on his wife, and your father did spend on her when he was able to, for twenty years, as you explained in your question.\nAccording to Islamic teachings, your father is still regarded as spending on your mother, because spending on her has nothing to do with the issue of where he is getting the money from that he spends on her.\nThe other issue is that the sons’ spending on their mother is to be regarded as being like the father spending on her, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “You and your wealth belong to your father.” Ahmad (6902); classed as sahih by al-Albani in al-Irwa’ (1625).\nAnd the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The best food that you eat is what you earn by your own hands, and your children are part of your earnings.” At-Tirmidhi (1358); classed as sahih by al-Albani.\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The father is obliged to spend on his wife, if her children cannot take care of her. But if her children are covering her expenses and they have been covering all her needs, then that is sufficient, because the children are his children too, and his rights over them are great. The Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “You and your wealth belong to your father.” So if they are covering their mother’s needs and spending on her, that is sufficient, praise be to Allah.\nBut if they are not covering her needs, and she is asking for maintenance, she has a choice: if she wishes, she may be patient, or if she wishes, she may say: Divorce me. She may ask for divorce if she cannot be patient, otherwise she should be patient. If her children spend on her and cover her needs, praise be to Allah, and there is no blame on the husband… If his children spend on her, then she has no right to complain or ask her husband to spend on her, because his children’s spending on her is like his spending on her. If they spend on her what is sufficient for her needs, praise be to Allah. If they do not spend on her and he does not spend on her either, then she may ask for divorce. (From the shaykh’s website.)\nBased on that, so long as you and your brother are spending on her and covering her needs, she has no right after that to ask for more maintenance from your father, and he is entitled to all his rights over her in full.\nOnce this is established, then it becomes clear that your mother’s refusing intimacy on the grounds that the father is not spending on her is not permissible, and as a result she is regarded as defiantly disobedient and is sinning.\nShe must fear Allah, for this is a grievous sin. It is soundly narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), as is stated in the hadith of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If a man calls his wife to his bed and she refuses to come, the angels will curse her until morning.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (3065).\nAccording to another hadith, “There is no man who calls his wife to his bed and she refuses, but the One Who is in heaven will be angry with her, until he is pleased with her.” Narrated by Muslim (1436).\nSecondly:\nFrom your question, it seems that your father was not falling short with regard to your mother’s rights or your rights when he was able to spend on you. When his circumstances changed and he was no longer able to spend, your mother forgot his kindness. This is ingratitude towards the husband concerning which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) warned the woman who does that of Hell. According to the hadith, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “I was shown Hell, and I saw that most of its inhabitants are women who are ungrateful (yakfurna).” It was said: Do they disbelieve (yakfurna) in Allah? He said: “They are ungrateful (yakfurna) to their husbands and are ungrateful for kind treatment. If you show kindness to one of them for a lifetime, then she sees something from you, she says: I have never seen anything good from you.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (29).\nIbn Battal (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This refers to the husband. Allah enjoined His Messenger to show gratitude for blessings. It says in the hadith: “He does not thank Allah who does not thank people.” Gratitude for the kindness of the husband comes under the heading of gratitude for the blessings of Allah, because every favour the husband does to his family is a blessing from Allah that He caused to come at his hands.""(Sharh Sahih al-Bukhari by Ibn Battal (1/89).\nWhat the hadith means is that they are denying kind treatment… This indicates that the one who denies the kindness of the one who was kind to him is blameworthy. Al-Karmani said: That is, you [women] deny the kind treatment of the husband and think little of whatever he gives you. We may understand from the warning of hellfire for being ungrateful and cursing a great deal that these are major sins. See: Sharh Ibn Majah by as-Suyuti, et al. (p. 289).\nHence it is important to advise your mother regarding this matter, and tell her that showing kindness to her husband is one of the means of a woman attaining the pleasure of Allah, and is one of the means of her attaining happiness in this world and the hereafter.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/459431/wife-refusing-to-fulfil-her-duties-towards-her-husband-because-he-is-not-spending-on-her
34420,What are the mistakes that some pilgrims make when stoning the Jamarat?,"['Praise be to Allah.Why was stoning the Jamarat prescribed?\nIt was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that he stoned Jamarat Al-`Aqabah which is Al-Jamarah Al-Quswa which is closer to Makkah, with seven pebbles, during the morning of the Day of Sacrifice, saying “Allahu akbar” with every pebble which was a little bigger than a chickpea.\xa0\xa0\nIbn Majah (3029) narrated that Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to me on the morning of Al-`Aqabah when he was standing atop his camel: “Come and pick up for me.” So I picked up pebbles for him which were a little bigger than a chickpea. He put them in his hand and said, “With pebbles like this stone (the Jamarat)… and beware of going to extremes, for those who came before you were destroyed because of going to extremes in religion.” (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah, 2455)\xa0\nAhmad and Abu Dawud narrated from `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Tawaf around the House, [Sa`i] between As-Safa and Al-Marwah and stoning the Jamarat have been prescribed to establish the remembrance of Allah.” This is the reason why the stoning of the Jamarat has been prescribed .\xa0\nMistakes made when stoning the Jamarat\nThere are many mistakes committed by some pilgrims when stoning the Jamarat .\xa0\n\nSome people think that the stoning of the Jamarat is not valid unless it is done with pebbles from Muzdalifah . Hence you will find them going to a lot of trouble to gather the pebbles from Muzdalifah before they go to Mina. This is a mistaken idea, because the pebbles may be taken from anywhere, from Muzdalifah, from Mina, or from any place. The point is that they should be pebbles.\xa0\n\nThere is no report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) picked up the pebbles from Muzdalifah, so that we could say that this is Sunnah. It is not Sunnah, and it is not obligatory to pick up the pebbles from Muzdalifah, because the Sunnah is either the words or actions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), or what he approved of – none of which apply in the case of picking up pebbles from Muzdalifah.\xa0\n\nSome people, when they pick up the pebbles, wash them, either for fear that someone may have urinated on them, or to clean them, because they think that if they are clean, this is better. Whatever the case, washing the pebbles is an innovation (Bid’ah), because the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not do that, and worshipping Allah by doing something that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not do is a kind of bid’ah. If a person does that without the intention of it being an act of worship then it is foolishness and is a waste of time.\xa0\n\n\nSome people think that these Jamarat are devils, and that they are actually stoning devils, so you may see them becoming very emotional and very angry, as if the Shaytan himself is in front of him, and this leads to the following grave errors:\xa0\n\n\nThis is a mistaken notion. We stone these Jamarat as an act of remembering Allah, following the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), as an act of worship. If a person does an act of worship and does not know its benefits, but he does it only as an act of worship for Allah, this will be more indicative of his humility and submission to Allah.\nA person may become very angry and emotional, so you see him disturbing people greatly, as if the people in front of him are vermin and he doesn’t care about them or the weak among them, he just goes forward like a crazy camel.\nA person may not remember that he is worshipping Allah by stoning these Jamarat. Hence he neglects to say the dhikr prescribed in sharee’ah and says words that are not prescribed in shari`ah, such as saying, “O Allah, we are angry with the Shaytan and are pleased with Al-Rahman (the Most Merciful),” even though this is not prescribed when stoning the Jamarat ; rather what is prescribed is to say “Allahu Akbar,” as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to do.\nBased on this false belief you will see some people picking up large rocks and throwing them, because they think that the bigger the rock, the greater the effect and revenge on the Shaytan. You also see them throwing shoes, pieces of wood and the like, which are not prescribed for throwing.\n\nSo if we say that this belief is false, what do we then believe about stoning the Jamarat? We believe that we stone the Jamarat as an act of veneration and worship of Allah, and following the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).\xa0\n\nSome people are careless and do not care whether the pebbles land in the pit around the Jamarat or not .\xa0\n\nIf the pebbles do not land in the pit around the Jamarat, then the stoning is not valid. It is sufficient for the person to think it most likely that the pebbles have landed in the pit around the Jamarat, and it is not essential to be certain, because certainty in this case may not be possible; if one cannot be certain that he should act on what he thinks is most likely. Islam allows a person to proceed on the basis of what he thinks is most likely, if he is uncertain as to how many rak’ahs he has prayed, three or four, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Let him decide what is most likely the case, then complete it on that basis.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 1020)\xa0\nThis proves that in matters of worship it is sufficient to base one’s actions on what he thinks is most likely the case. This is because Allah wants to make things easy because it may not be possible to be certain.\xa0\nIf the pebbles land in the pit around the Jamarat, then the duty has been discharged, whether they stay in the pit or roll out of it.\xa0\n\nSome people think that the pebbles must hit the pillar in the pit. This is a mistaken notion, because it is not essential for the stoning to be valid that the pebbles should hit this pillar. This pillar is only there as a marker for the pit in which the pebbles land. If the pebbles land in the pit that is sufficient, whether they hit the pillars or not.\xa0\n\n\nOne of the most serious mistakes that are made is when some people take the matter of stoning the Jamarat lightly, and delegate someone else to do it on their behalf even though they are able to do it. This is a serious mistake, because stoning the Jamarat is one of the rituals of Hajj. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n\n“And perform properly (i.e. all the ceremonies according to the ways of Prophet Muhammad), the Hajj and `Umrah (i.e. the pilgrimage to Makkah) for Allah.” [Al-Baqarah 2:196]\nThis means completing Hajj with all its rituals in full. So each person must do them himself, and not delegate someone else to do it on his behalf.\xa0\nSome people say, “The place is too crowded and it is too difficult for me.” We say to them, “If the crowding is too bad when the people first come to Mina from Muzdalifah it will not be so bad at the end of the day, or at night. If you do not manage to stone the Jamarat during the day, then you can do it at night, because night is also the time for stoning, although the day is preferable. But it is better for a person to come and do the stoning at night in a calm, dignified and humble manner than to come during the day fearing that he may die because of the overcrowding, and he may throw his pebbles and they may not land in the pit. The point is if someone uses the overcrowding as an excuse, we say to him: Allah has given plenty of room for manoeuvre, so you can stone the Jamarat at night.\xa0\nSimilarly if a woman is afraid of something if she stones the Jamarat with the people, she can delay it until the night. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not allow the weak ones among his family – such as Sawdah bint Zam’ah (may Allah be pleased with her) and those like her – to forego stoning the Jamarat and to delegate someone else to do it on their behalf; rather he gave them permission to leave Muzdalifah at the end of the night, to stone the Jamarat before the place became crowded. This is the greatest evidence that a woman should not delegate this task just because she is a woman.\xa0\nYes, if a person is disabled and unable to stone the Jamarat by himself, either during the day or at night, then in this case it is permissible for him to delegate it to someone else , because he is incapable of doing it. It was narrated from the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) that they used to stone the Jamarat on behalf of their children, because the children were unable to do it.\xa0\nWhatever the case, being careless with regard to this matter – i.e., delegating the stoning of the Jamarat, except for those who have excuses which mean that they are unable to do it – is a serious mistake, because it is carelessness with regard to an act of worship, and negligence with regard to a duty.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34420/mistakes-made-when-stoning-the-jamarat
476499,"We intend, in sha Allah, to slaughter the ‘aqiqah for our daughter, may Allah bless her. My husband does not fast for health reasons; is it permissible to take some of the ‘aqiqah meat and use it to feed poor people for the days on which my husband does not fast in Ramadan?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly\nThe sick person for whom there is no hope of recovery should not fast, and he should feed one poor person for each day.\nAs for the sick person for whom there is the hope of recovery, he may not fast, but he must make up the days he missed when he recovers, and he does not have to offer any fidyah.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Majmu‘ (6/261): The sick person who is unable to fast because of sickness from which he hopes to recover does not have to fast at present, but he must make up the fasts later on. This applies if he will face real hardship when fasting. End quote.\nSo if your husband’s sickness is one from which there is no hope of recovery, it is permissible for him to feed one poor person for each day.\nSecondly:\nIt is permissible to take some of the meat of the ‘aqiqah and use it for the fidyah for not fasting, for two reasons:\n1.. Because only a small part of the ‘aqiqah is to be given in charity, then the one who offered it may dispose of it by eating it himself or otherwise.\nIt says in al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (5/103): Ash-Shafa‘i said: After slaughtering an obligatory sacrifice (udhiyah) in fulfilment of a vow, the person must give all of it in charity.\nAs for the non-obligatory sacrifice, he must give some of the raw meat in charity, and it should not be something that is of no value. The Hanbalis added that if he does not give any of it in charity until it is all gone, then he is liable for giving to the poor the price of the least of it in value that is not regarded as being worthless. End quote.\nIt also says (6/116): With regard to the ‘aqiqah (which is that which is sacrificed on behalf of the newborn), the ruling on whether it is recommended (mustahabb) to eat some of it and feed others with some of it is the same as the ruling on the udhiyah (sacrifice).\n2.. It is permissible to sell the meat of the ‘aqiqah, because it does not go out of the individual’s ownership when he specifies that this is an ‘aqiqah and slaughters it, in contrast to the udhiyah, as it is not permissible to sell any part of the latter. As it does not go out of his ownership, then he has the right to dispose of it in whatever way he likes.\nIt says in Matalib Uli an-Nuha (2/492): It does not go out of his ownership by being slaughtered, so he may sell it, in contrast to the udhiyah, because there is a similarity between the udhiyah and the ‘aqiqah, which is that they are both acts of worship. But the ‘aqiqah is prescribed on a happy occasion, so it is more akin to the walimah (wedding feast). End quote.\nConclusion: It is permissible to take some of the meat of the ‘aqiqah and offer it as fidyah for not fasting, or as expiation for breaking an oath (kaffarat yamin) and so on, because it is meat that belongs to the one who offered it, so it is permissible for him to dispose of it.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/476499/is-it-permissible-to-give-some-of-the-aqiqah-meat-as-expiation-for-breaking-an-oath-or-a-fidyah-for-not-fasting-in-ramadan

Is it after Hajj, Tawaf Al-Ifadah, Sa`i and cutting the hair -- if the intention is to do Hajj only (i.e., Ifrad) -- and has he then exited Ihram completely, or does he not exit Ihram until after the three days of Tashriq and stoning the Jamarat?","['Praise be to Allah.When to exit Ihram in Hajj?\nStanding Committee for Academic Research and Issuing Fatwas said.\xa0\n“Exiting Ihram of Hajj , for both men and women, comes after stoning Jamrat Al-`Aqabah and shaving the head or cutting the hair for men, but women have no option but cutting the hair.\xa0\nAt that point, it becomes permissible for each of them to do everything that was forbidden to them whilst in Ihram, apart from intercourse. As for exiting Ihram completely, that comes after finishing Tawaf Al-Ifadah and Sa`i, if the pilgrim still has to do Sa`i. Then everything that was forbidden to them whilst in Ihram becomes permissible for them, even intercourse.\xa0\nWhen to exit Ihram in `Umrah?\nWith regard to exiting Ihram of `Umrah , for both men and women, it comes after finishing their Tawaf and Sa`i, and shaving the head or cutting the hair for men , but women have no option but cutting the hair and not shaving. Then it becomes permissible for them to do everything that was forbidden to them whilst in Ihram .
