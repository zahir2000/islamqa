356223,"I work in a company that manufactures metal tables, and we use a substance that resembles ghee to polish and shine the metal. This “ghee” contains a substance that is extracted from lard, and when we use it, some of it comes off onto our clothes. My question is: is this substance impure, and are we not permitted to pray with this “ghee” on our clothes?","['Praise be to Allah.Lard (pig fat) is impure according to scholarly consensus, so if it gets onto the Muslim’s clothes, he must purify them before he starts to pray.\nIbn Hazm (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe scholars are unanimously agreed that the meat, fat, marrow, brains and cartilage of dead meat (animals that died without being slaughtered in the prescribed manner), and the meat, fat, marrow, brains and sinews of pigs, are all haram, and all of that is impure (najis).""(Maratib al-Ijma‘\xa0 p. 23).\nIt is only prohibited to eat pig fat (lard); as for using it for purposes other than food, such as using it to polish metal, wood and the like, that is permissible.\nSo if there is a compound which contains some lard, is that compound impure? We should look at the lard that is used: if it is a small amount and is absorbed into the compound, so that it leaves no trace of its colour, smell or taste, then the compound is not impure, because the impurity has no impact on it.\nThe same also applies if there is some manufacturing process through which the lard turns into some other substance, which is what the jurists call istihalah (transformation); the substance is deemed to be pure in that case.\nBut if the lard is still there, with its characteristics, even if it is a small amount but its traces can be detected in the compound, then in this case the compound is impure, and if anything of this impure compound gets onto a Muslim’s clothes, he must purify it before starting to pray, or he should have other clothes in which he can pray.\nIbn ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe scholars are unanimously agreed that one of the conditions of prayer is that one’s garments, the water and one’s body must be pure (tahir).""(At-Tamhid\xa0 22/242).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/356223/is-a-substance-that-contains-lard-pig-fat-as-one-of-its-components-regarded-as-impure-najis
275057,"I was praying, and when I wanted to say the salaam, I intended to say the salaam to the angels, but I did not bring to mind the intention to exit the prayer. A few seconds after finishing the two taslims, I became uncertain about what I was doing, and I repeated the two taslims, then I did the prostration of forgetfulness. Is what I did correct?","['Praise be to Allah.The basic principle is that the worshipper intends by saying the taslim at the end of the prayer to exit the prayer, just as he intends to start the prayer when he says the takbir at the beginning.\nIt was narrated from ‘Ali, from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), that he said: “The key to prayer is purification, it begins with the takbir and ends with the taslim.” Narrated by Abu Dawud (61) and by at-Tirmidhi (3), who said: This hadith is the soundest and best thing that has been narrated regarding this matter. It was also classed as sahih by al-Albani in Irwa’ al-Ghalil (2/8).\nIbn Rushd (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe taslim to exit the prayer is like the takbir to start it in all circumstances, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) mentioned them together, as he said:\xa0 “The prayer begins with the takbir and ends with the taslim.”\nJust as he cannot begin the prayer except by saying the takbir with the intention of beginning the prayer, similarly he cannot exit the prayer except by saying the taslim with the intention of exiting from the prayer.""(Al-Muqaddimat al-Mumahhidat\xa0 1/175).\nBut if the worshipper forgets the intention when saying the taslim, then the most correct view among the views of the jurists is that his prayer is valid, because the intention at the beginning of the prayer includes all of the actions and words thereof.\nPlease see the answer to question no. 175471 .\nMoreover, your bringing to mind the intention to greet the angels with salaam was similar to bringing to mind the intention to finish the prayer and exit from it, because greeting the angels with salaam in the prayer is only done when exiting the prayer. But the worshipper may sometimes focus on one idea more than the other, so it seems to him that he has neglected one of them, but in fact he has brought both ideas to mind.\nThe basic principle regarding the thoughts that crossed your mind after you said the taslim is that they are mere doubts, and doubts after completing the prayer are to be ignored and do not matter.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nHaving doubts after completing an act of worship does not matter, whether you are have doubts about the intention (niyyah) or about some parts of the act of worship. That does not matter unless you are certain.""(Ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘\xa0 1/206).\nTo sum up, your prayer is valid, and these thoughts that crossed your mind do not matter. Even if you are certain that you did not form the intention to exit the prayer, your prayer is still valid according to the more correct view of the jurists.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/275057/he-thinks-that-he-did-not-call-to-mind-the-intention-to-exit-the-prayer-when-saying-the-salaam-is-his-prayer-valid
