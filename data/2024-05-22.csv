138693,"If the end of my menses is approaching, am I obliged to wake up before Fajr prayer in order to find out whether my period has ended or not? Please note that it had not ended before ‘Isha’ prayer. Do I have to wake up before sunrise in order to find out whether my period has ended or not? Please note that my period had not ended before the time of Fajr prayer.","['Praise be to Allah.If the end of a woman’s period is approaching, she does not have to wake up before Fajr to check whether her period has ended or not, because that comes under the heading of extra effort and hardship of which this ummah has been relieved. No report to that effect has been narrated from the earliest generations. Rather the woman should check before she goes to sleep, and at the times of the daily prayers, so she should check before the sun rises, and between Zuhr and ‘Asr, and so on.\nAl-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Chapter on the beginning and end of menses … The daughter of Zayd ibn Thabit heard that women were calling for lamps in the depths of the night to see whether their menses had ended. She said: The women never used to do that, and she rebuked them. End quote.\nThis report was also narrated by Malik in al-Muwatta’.\nIbn ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The daughter of Zayd ibn Thabit only rebuked the women for checking on their status when it was not the time for prayer and the time for prayer was not approaching because the depths of the night is not a time for obligatory prayer, and women are only required to check on their status for the purpose of praying, so that if their menses has ended, they can do ghusl, because they are obliged to pray.\nEnd quote from Fath al-Bari by Ibn Rajab al-Hanbali (1/491).\nAl-Khurashi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Sharh Mukhtasar Khalil (1/207): She does not have to check whether her menses has ended before Fajr; rather she should check when going to sleep and in the morning. In other words, during her menses and afterwards, the menstruating woman does not have to check whether her menses has ended before Fajr. That is neither obligatory nor recommended; rather it is disliked (makruh). She should check when going to sleep and at the time of each of the daily prayers, but what is required is to allow enough time so that she can do ghusl and offer her obligatory prayer. End quote.\nSo if she realises after Fajr that her period has ended, but she is not sure whether it ended before or after Fajr, she should pray Fajr only, and does not have to pray Maghrib and ‘Isha’. If she fasts on that day, it is not valid, because there is no certainty that her period had ended before Fajr.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/138693/is-the-menstruating-woman-required-to-check-whether-her-period-has-ended-before-fajr
227879,"I did Hajj, following what others were doing, several years ago, i.e., I had not learned all the rituals and the order in which they were to be done. Allah blessed me by enabling me to do `Umrah before Hajj. I remember that we started Tawaf on the upper level, and I was following my family and doing what they did. I did not realise that we had started Tawaf at first; in other words, I started to perform the ritual without realising what I was doing, and for a little while I thought that we were still walking in the midst of the crowd. Does that affect the validity of the act of worship, or is this waswas?","['Praise be to Allah.It is not essential to form a specific intention for Tawaf or Sa`i or any of the rituals of Hajj; rather the general intention is sufficient, namely the intention to perform Hajj or `Umrah when entering Ihram.\nAl-Hafidh Jalal Ad-Din As-Suyuti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“With regard to acts of worship that are composed of several actions, it is sufficient to form the intention at the beginning, and there is no need for a new intention for each action, because the initial intention includes all of that. This applies to acts of worship such as Wudu and prayer, and also Hajj. There is no need to form a specific intention for Tawaf , Sa`i and standing (in `Arafah), according to the more correct opinion.” (Al-Ashbah wan-Nadha’ir by As-Suyuti, p. 27)\nShaykh Muhammad Al-Amin Ash-Shinqiti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“It should be understood that the scholarly view that is most likely to be correct, in sha Allah, is that Tawaf does not need a specific intention, because the intention to perform Hajj is sufficient and includes it. This applies to all the actions of Hajj, such as standing in `Arafah, staying overnight in Muzdalifah, Sa`i and stoning the Jamarat. None of these actions requires a specific intention, because the intention to perform Hajj includes all of them. This is the view of most of the scholars, and the evidence for that is clear, because the intention to perform an act of worship includes all of its parts. Just as there is no need for a specific intention for every bow and prostration in the prayer, because the intention to pray includes all of that, by the same token there is no need for a specific intention for each of the actions of Hajj, because the intention to perform Hajj includes all of them.\nOne of the things that the scholars quoted as evidence for that is the fact that if a person were to stand in `Arafah without realising where he is, it would still be valid, according to scholarly consensus. This was stated by An-Nawawi.\nIn addition to the view that is correct, in sha Allah, there are two other scholarly views:\nThe first is the view of Abu `Ali ibn Abu Hurayrah, who was a Shafi`i; this view states that specific actions such as Tawaf, Sa`i and stoning the Jamarat require a specific intention, and matters that do not require a specific action, and simply involve staying in a place, such as standing in `Arafah and staying overnight in Muzdalifah, do not require a specific intention.\nThe second view is that of Abu Is-haq Al-Marwazi, which is that none of the actions of Hajj require a specific intention except Tawaf , because it is a form of prayer, and there should be an intention for prayer.\nHowever, the view that is most likely to be correct, in sha Allah, is the first one, which is the view of the majority.” (Adwa’ Al-Bayan fi Idah Al-Qur’an bil-Qur’an, 4/414)\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“This is an important matter. The intention should be formed immediately before doing the act of worship, and it is recommended to be aware of this intention throughout the prayer. This is preferable, so that the intention will accompany the deed at every stage thereof. This is what is best, but if it slips your mind during the prayer, does that harm you or not? No, it does not harm you because your action is based on the initial intention.\nHence many of the scholars – including Shaykh Muhammad Ash-Shinqiti (may Allah have mercy on him) – were of the view that it is not essential to form the intention for Tawaf or Sa`i, because Tawaf and Sa`i are part of an act of worship. Just as you do not form a specific intention to bow or prostrate in the prayer – because your general intention of performing prayer at the beginning is sufficient – by the same token, with regard to Tawaf and Sa`i, and other parts of the acts of worship, from the time you said Labbayk `Umratan [In response to Your call, here I am for `Umrah] at the Miqat, you had already formed the intention to do all the acts of `Umrah.\nMoreover, this is easier for people. Many people – especially when it is very crowded – enter the Sacred House and start Tawaf, and they forget to form a specific intention to perform the Tawaf of `Umrah or any other kind of Tawaf, so if we affirm that Tawaf and Sa`i are like bowing and prostration in the prayer, and that the general intention includes them both, this will make things much easier for people. This is the view of many of the scholars, and it is the view that we favour. In fact many people get overwhelmed, especially when they see the huge numbers of people [in the Haram], so they enter the mosque with the intention of doing Tawaf , without bringing to mind whether it is for Hajj or `Umrah, but they still formed the intention of doing Tawaf, because they came in order to do Tawaf.” (Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin’s commentary on Al-Kafi, 1/384)\nBased on the above, your Tawaf was valid and you do not have to do anything else.\nIf what happened to you was simply that you were uncertain after having finished the act of worship, then no attention is to be paid to this uncertainty, because uncertainty after having done an act of worship is of no significance, and it comes under the heading of Waswas from the Shaytan .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/227879/is-it-essential-to-form-a-specific-intention-for-tawaf
111777,We know that there will be wives in Paradise; will there be any pregnancy and childbirth?,"['Praise be to Allah.Can you have children in Jannah?\nSome of the scholars are of the view that if a person wishes to have a child in Paradise, Allah will fulfil that wish for him. They quoted as evidence for that the report narrated by At-Tirmidhi (2563) in his Sunan from Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If the believer wishes for a child in Paradise, the pregnancy, birth and growth will occur within an hour, as he wishes.” (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Al-Jami`, 6649)\xa0\nWhat is meant is that the pregnancy will occur and the child will be born and will grow to the age of perfection, which is thirty years, as the person wishes, i.e., the child will be male or female and so on, in accordance with the person’s wishes.\xa0\nThis is the view of many of the scholars.\xa0\nSome of the scholars said that in Paradise there will be intercourse but there will be no children. This view was narrated from Tawus, Muhajid and Ibrahim An-Nakha`i (may Allah have mercy on them).\xa0\nImam Al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It was narrated from Abu Razin Al-`Uqayli that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The people of Paradise will not have children there.”\xa0\nThe Hadith referred to by Al-Bukhari was narrated by Imam Ahmad (15773) from Abu Razin Al-`Uqayli (may Allah be pleased with him) in a lengthy Hadith in which it says “The righteous women will be for the righteous man, you will enjoy them as you enjoyed them in this world, and they will enjoy you, but you will not produce children.”\xa0\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “It has the dignity and light of Prophethood which suggests that it is authentic. However it was classed as inauthentic by Al-Albani in Zalal Al-Jannah, and Shu`ayb Al-Arna’ut said: “Its chain of narrators is weak and is a series of unknown narrators.”\xa0\nThe Hadith clearly states that there will be no childbirth, but there is a difference of opinion as to its soundness.\xa0\nWith regard to the Hadith of Abu Sa`id (may Allah be pleased with him), “If the believer wishes for a child in Paradise, the pregnancy, birth and growth will occur within an hour, as he wishes”, it was noted that its soundness is subject to further discussion. Hence Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said concerning it: “Its chain of narrators meets the conditions of soundness, but it is very strange.” (Hadi Al-Arwah, p. 213)\xa0\nAnd he said: With regard to this Hadith of Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri, the best of its chain of narrators is that of At-Tirmidhi, who determined that it is strange and that it is only known from the Hadith of Abu’s-Siddiq an-Naji, and the wording of the Hadith is not sound.”\nImam Ishaq ibn Rahawayh (may Allah have mercy on him) said concerning the Hadith of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), “If the believer wishes for a child in Paradise, the pregnancy, birth and growth will occur within an hour, as he wishes”: But he will not wish. What is meant by the words of Ishaq is that the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), “If the believer wishes …” are hypothetical) i.e., if the believer were to wish, but in fact he will not wish).\xa0\nWhy will there be no childbirth in Paradise?\nIbn Al-Qayyim mentioned a number of reasons why it is most likely that there will be no childbirth in Paradise, such as the following:\xa0\n\nThe Hadith of Ibn Razin\nThe words of Allah, may He be Exalted (interpretation of the meaning): “Therein they shall have Azwajun Mutahharatun (purified mates or wives)” [An-Nisa’ 4:57]. They are the ones who have been purified from menses, Nifas (postpartum bleeding) and so on.\n\nIt was narrated that Mujahid said: Purified from menses, stools, urine, sputum, spitting, maniy and childbirth.\n\nAllah, may He be Glorified, made pregnancy and childbirth along with\xa0 menses and maniy; if women were to become pregnant in Paradise, menses and other discharges would not cease for them.\nIt is proven that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There will remain in Paradise surplus space, and Allah will create a creation for it and cause them to inhabit it (the surplus space).” (Narrated by Muslim, 5085) If there were to be childbirth in Paradise, then this surplus space would be for those who would be born there, and they would be more entitled to it than others.\nAllah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And those who believe and whose offspring follow them in Faith, to them shall We join their offspring” [At-Tur 52:21]. Here He tells us that He will honour them by joining them to their offspring that they had in this world. If they were to have offspring in Paradise, Allah would have referred to them as He referred to their worldly offspring, because they would be delighted with them (the hypothetical offspring in Paradise) as they were delighted with their children in this world (i.e., the fact that He mentioned only the worldly offspring indicates that there will be no offspring in Paradise).\nEither we say that there will be ongoing procreation in Paradise or that it will continue until some point, then cease. But both ideas are impossible, because the former implies endless birth of new individuals, whilst the latter implies the end of one of the pleasures of the people of Paradise, and that is impossible. And we cannot say that there will be procreation and people will die to be succeeded by others, because there is no death there.\nPeople will not grow in Paradise as they did in this world, so the children of its people will not grow and become bigger, and the men will not grow. Rather these children will remain small and will not change, and the adults will be thirty-three years old and will not change either. If there were any childbirth in Paradise, then the child would have to grow until it became an adult. It is well known that children who die will reach the age of thirty-three without growing.\xa0\n\nThen he said: Paradise is not the realm of procreation; rather it is the place of eternal abode and those who are in it will never die and be replaced by their offspring.” (Hadi Al-Arwah, 1/173)\xa0\nFor more details, please refer to the following answers: 5981 , 20469 , and 149336 ,\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/111777/can-you-have-kids-in-jannah
272059,"There is a woman in her forties whose younger brother, who is thirty years old, did her marriage contract without the knowledge of her older brother, who is fifty years old, and her father is deceased. Is the marriage contract valid, or is it not valid unless the guardian is the older brother?","['Praise be to Allah.In order for the marriage to be valid, the marriage contract should be done by the woman’s guardian or his proxy, in the presence of two male, Muslim witnesses, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no [valid] marriage without a guardian.” Narrated by Abu Dawud (2085), at-Tirmidhi (1101) and Ibn Majah (1881) from Abu Musa al-Ash‘ari; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih at-Tirmidhi. And he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There can be no [valid] marriage except with a guardian and two witnesses of good character.” Narrated by al-Bayhaqi from ‘Imran and ‘A’ishah; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami‘, no. 7557.\nThe woman’s guardian is her father, then his father, then her son, then his son (if she has a son), then her brother through both parents, then her brother through her father only, then their sons, then her paternal uncles, then their sons, then the paternal uncles of her father, then the ruler. See: al-Mughni (9/355).\nBased on that:\nIf the father and grandfather of the woman are both deceased, and she has no adult son, then guardianship passes to her full brothers.\nSecondly: if the guardians are equal in their degree of kinship, such as full brothers, then the jurists differed as to which of them takes precedence with regard to guardianship. Some of them said that the one who is most entitled to it is the best of them in terms of knowledge and religious commitment; if they are equal in that, then the older one takes precedence, and if they argue and compete, then they should draw lots. This is the view of the Shafa‘is and Hanbalis.\nSome of them said that the best of them [in terms of knowledge and religious commitment] should take precedence, and if they compete, then the judge should decide which of them takes precedence. If there is no judge, then they should draw lots.\nAccording to either view, if she appoints one of them, then guardianship belongs to him.\nIf one of them goes ahead and arranges her marriage, with her consent, her marriage is valid, even if he is the youngest of his brothers, so long as he is an adult, whether the other brothers are aware of that or not.\nAl-Khatib ash-Sharbini ash-Shafa‘i said in Mughni al-Muhtaj (4/265): If the guardians are the same in degree of kinship, such as full brothers, or brothers through the father, or paternal uncles, and she gives permission to all of them, or she says: I give permission to do the marriage contract for me with So-and-so, then whoever among you wants to may give me in marriage to him, then it is recommended (mustahabb) that the one who has greater knowledge regarding the issue of marriage should do her marriage contract, because he has more knowledge of the conditions thereof. The next in order of precedence is the most pious of them, as it says in ar-Rawdah, because he is more compassionate and more keen to make sure that the suitor is a good choice. After him comes the oldest, because he has more experience of life, if that is with the consent of the others, so that they will all agree and so that no one will get upset because another dealt with the matter on their own.\nIf one who is less qualified gives her in marriage with her consent to a compatible suitor, that is valid, and the others should not object. End quote.\nAl-Bahuti al-Hanbali said in Kashshaf al-Qina‘ (5/58): If two or more guardians of the woman are equal in degree of kinship, such as her brothers from both parents or through the father, or paternal uncles, or sons of her brothers, if she gives permission to one of them, then he is the one who should represent her in the marriage contract, and it is not valid for anyone else, to whom she did not give permission, to do the marriage contract for her, because he does not have permission. If she gives permission to all of them and one of them gives her in marriage, it is valid for any of them to give her in marriage, because each of them is a valid guardian.\nBut the best is to give precedence to the most virtuous among those who are equal in terms of knowledge and religious commitment. Then if they are equal in terms of knowledge and religious commitment, precedence should be given to the oldest of them. End quote.\nIn Hashiyat ad-Dasuqi by al-Maliki (2/233), it says: If she appoints one of her brothers, for example, then the other brothers have no right to interfere in the matter or to compete with him.

50180,"When is it permissible for a sick person to pray sitting down, because he may be able to stand but with great difficulty?","['Praise be to Allah.Is standing a pillar of prayer?\nIn the answer to question no\xa050684 \xa0we have stated that standing is a pillar or essential part of the obligatory prayers, so the prayer of one who prays sitting when he is able to stand is not valid. But like all other obligatory duties, this may be waived in the case of inability to do it.\xa0\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Majmu` (4/201):\xa0\n“The Ummah unanimously agreed that whoever is unable to stand in an obligatory prayer may pray sitting down, and he does not have to repeat the prayer. Our companions said: his reward will not be less than the reward for offering the prayer standing up, because he is excused. It was proven in Sahih Al-Bukhari that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If a person is sick or is travelling, the reward of what he used to do when he was healthy and not travelling with be written for him.”” \xa0\nExcuses which allow praying sitting down\nThe guidelines for the excuse which allows one not to stand and to offer obligatory prayers sitting down , are as follows:\xa0\n\nThat he be unable to stand\nThat it will make his sickness worse\nThat it will delay his recovery\nThat it should cause great difficulty of such a scale that he will be unable to focus properly. If the difficulty caused is less than that, then it is not permissible for him to sit.\n\nAl-Bukhari (1117) narrated that `Imran ibn Husayn (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I had haemorrhoids and I asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about praying. He said: “Pray standing, and if you cannot, then whilst sitting, and if you cannot, then whilst lying on your side.”\xa0\nAl-Hafidh (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The words “If you cannot” were quoted as evidence by those who say that a sick person should not start to sit whilst praying until after he becomes unable to stand. This was narrated by `Iyad from Ash-Shafi`i. It was narrated from Malik, Ahmad and Is-Haq that it is not essential that a person be unable to stand, rather if it is very difficult for him to stand (then he may sit).\xa0\nThe well-known view among the Shafi`is is that what is meant by not being able is that it is very difficult to stand, or there is the fear that the sickness may be made worse or it may lead to the death of the patient. Slight difficulty is not sufficient (as an excuse ). Another example of great hardship is dizziness in the case of a passenger on a boat who fears that he may drown if he prays standing in the boat.\xa0\nThe majority also quote as evidence the hadith of Ibn ‘Abbas which was narrated by At-Tabarani (may Allah have mercy on him): “He should pray standing, but if he encounters difficulty then sitting, and if he encounters difficulty, then lying down.”” (Fat-h Al-Bari)\xa0\nThe Hadith of Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) which was mentioned by Al-Hafidh was also quoted by Al-Haythami in Majma` Al-Zawa’id, 2897, where he says:\xa0\n“This was narrated by At-Tabarani in Al-Awsat. He said: It was not narrated from Ibn Jurayj except by Halas ibn Muhammad Al-Dab’i. I (Al-Haythami) say: I cannot find anyone who wrote his biography, but the rest of the men in its chain of narrators are trustworthy.”\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Mughni, 1/443:\xa0\n“If he is able to stand (he should do so), otherwise if he fears that his sickness will become worse or his recovery will be slowed or it is extremely difficult for him to stand, then he may pray sitting down. Something similar was said by Malik and Ishaq… because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“and has not laid upon you in religion any hardship” [Al-Hajj 22:78]\xa0\nThe obligation of standing in this case is a hardship.\xa0\nAnd the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prayed sitting down when he was wounded in his right cheek; it seems that he was not completely unable to stand, but because it was difficult for him to stand, he was excused.”\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Majmu`, 4/201:\n“Our companions said: Being unable does not necessarily mean that one cannot stand and slight difficulty is not enough reason for not standing; rather what counts is obvious difficulty. If a person fears immense hardship or worsening of the sickness etc., or if a passenger in a boat fears that he may drown or become dizzy, he may pray sitting down, and he does not have to repeat the prayer. Imam Al-Haramayn said: What I think with regard to the guidelines on what constitutes an inability to stand is that standing would cause hardship that would prevent him from focusing properly, because proper focus is the purpose of prayer.”\nThe view favoured by Imam Al-Haramayn (may Allah have mercy on him) is the view which Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) thought most likely to be correct. He said: \xa0\n“The guideline on what constitutes hardship is that which prevents one from focusing properly. Proper focus means having presence of mind and being at ease. If standing will cause intense anxiety which makes one ill at ease and makes him wish to reach the end of Al-Fatihah quickly so that he can bow, because it is too hard to stand, then he may pray sitting down.” (Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti’, 4/326.\nFor more details, please refer to the following answers: 142657 , 143720 , 226368 , and 115143 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/50180/can-i-pray-sitting-down-if-im-tired
