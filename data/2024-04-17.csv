153418,"I work for an agricultural company, and they give me a ticket to travel to my city with a specific travel company. Is it permissible for me to book with this company, then cancel the booking and book with another company that costs less, and keep the difference? Or can I cancel the booking with the first company and travel by land, and keep the price of the air ticket?","['Praise be to Allah.It is permissible for the employee who is given a travel ticket by his work to make use of the price of the ticket and travel by land, or travel on a different airline than the one for which he was given a ticket, and keep the difference between the two prices, unless his work does not allow that.\nThe basic principle regarding that is paying attention to what was agreed upon between the two parties, namely the employee and the workplace, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{O you who have believed, fulfill [all] contracts}\xa0[al-Ma’idah 5:1];\nand the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The Muslims are bound by their conditions.” Narrated by Abu Dawud (3594); classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud.\nShaykh Dr. ‘Abd al-Karim al-Khudayr (may Allah preserve him) was asked: Is it permissible to sell government airline tickets given to me, because I travelled by land?\nHe replied: There is nothing wrong with selling the tickets if you do not need them, unless travelling by land will result in you being late in returning to work. In that case, it is not permissible for you to travel except by the approved means of transportation, namely by plane.

11586,Is it true that whoever gets married has completed half of his religion? What is the evidence for that?,"['Praise be to Allah.The Sunnah indicates that it is prescribed to get married , and that it is one of the Sunnahs of the Messengers . By getting married a person can, with the help of Allah, overcome many of the traps of evil, for marriage helps him to lower his gaze and guard his chastity.\xa0\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said in the Hadith, “O young men, whoever among you can afford it, let him get married , for it is more effective in lowering the gaze and guarding chastity…” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim)\xa0\nAl-Hakim (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated in Al-Mustadrak from Anas (may Allah be pleased with him), that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whomever Allah blesses with a righteous wife, He has helped him with half of his religion, so let him fear Allah with regard to the other half.”\xa0\nAl-Bayhaqi (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated in Shu`ab Al-Iman from Al-Raqashi (may Allah have mercy on him): “When a person gets married he has completed half of his religion, so let him fear Allah with regard to the other half.” Al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) said of these two Hadiths in Sahih At-Targhib wat-Tarhib (1916): “(They are) sound.”\xa0\nAnd Allah is the Source of strength.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11586/is-marriage-half-of-the-religion
475342,Is there a hadith says “One prayer in al-Masjid al-Haram is equivalent to one hundred prayers in the Prophet’s Mosque”? This wording is quoted by some of the later scholars.,"['Praise be to Allah.We have not come across a report with the same wording and in the same order as that which is mentioned in the question, “One prayer in al-Masjid al-Haram is equivalent to one hundred prayers in the Prophet’s Mosque.”\nBut there is a report with the same meaning and similar wording, as was narrated by Imam Ahmad in al-Musnad (26/41-42) and by Ibn Hibbaan in al-Ihsan (4/499): It was narrated from Hammad ibn Zayd, from Habib al-Mu‘allim, from ‘Ata’ ibn Abi Rabah, from ‘Abdullah ibn az-Zubayr, who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “One prayer in this mosque of mine is better than a thousand prayers offered in any other mosque except al-Masjid al-Haram, and one prayer in al-Masjid al-Haram is better than a hundred prayers here” – meaning in the mosque of Madinah.\nThe narrators of this isnad are trustworthy (thiqat).\nThe commentators on al-Musnad said: The isnad is sahih according to the conditions of Muslim, and its narrators are trustworthy, the narrators of al-Bukhari and Muslim, except for Habib al-Mu‘allim. Al-Bukhari narrated a corroborating report from him and Muslim quoted some of his reports as evidence. End quote.\nWhat appears to be the case is that the wording mentioned in the question points to the same meaning as this hadith of Ibn az-Zubayr.\nA number of scholars stated that a report which gives the same meaning, but not the exact wording, may be accepted if the narrator is a scholar and he has the ability to avoid changing the meaning of the report when changing the wording.\nIbn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAt-Tirmidhi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAs for one who mentions the isnad precisely but changes the wording of the report, this is something that is widely practised by the scholars, provided that the meaning is not changed thereby…\nWhat at-Tirmidhi meant by this phrase that we have quoted here is that one who mentions the isnad precisely but changes the text without changing the meaning is still regarded as a trustworthy narrator whose narration carries weight.\nHe based that on the fact that narrating hadith on the basis of the meaning (not the exact wording) is acceptable, and he narrated that from the scholars. His words may give the impression that there is consensus, but that is not the case; rather it was the view of many of the scholars, and it was stated by Ahmad, who said: The scholars of hadith frequently narrate hadiths by giving the meaning (not the exact wording).\nBut that is only permissible for one who has knowledge of the language of the Arabs and their styles in expressing meanings, and who knows what phrases could alter the meaning and what phrases do not alter the meaning. This was stated by ash-Shafa‘i.""(Sharh ‘Ilal at-Tirmidhi\xa0 1/425-427).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/475342/is-there-a-hadith-which-says-one-prayer-in-al-masjid-al-haram-is-equivalent-to-one-hundred-prayers-in-the-prophets-mosque
1804,What does Islam say about life partner? Is she/he fixed by Allah or Allah has left it for us to decide?,"['Praise be to Allah.First of all, we should realize that there is no contradiction between our belief that Allah has decreed everything, and our belief that He has given us free will which enables us to do things. Confirming the free will of His slaves, Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""To whomsoever among you wills to walk straight"" [At-Takwir 81:28]\n\nOur will operates within the will of Allah , not outside of it, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""But you cannot will, unless Allah wills…"" [Al-Insan 76:30]\xa0\nThus it is not permitted to try to cancel one idea out with the other, or to deny either of them. Allah has confirmed both, that man has the power to choose, and that nothing can operate outside of His Will, may He be Glorified.\n\nIf we apply this to the question asked, we will see that man has freedom of will through which he can choose whichever woman he wishes to marry , and that whatever choice he makes has already been decreed by Allah.\xa0\nThe man’s choice is the means by which he gets what he wants, but some obstacles may come between the person and what he wants, in which case he will realize that Allah has not decreed this for him, for some reason which is known to Him.\nEverything that Allah does is good, and His slaves do not have knowledge of the Unseen or of how things will end. A person may regret missing out on something when it is good that he did not have it, or he may hate something that happens to him when it is good that it happened to him, as Allah tells us (interpretation of the meaning): ""… it may be that you dislike a thing which is good for you and that you like a thing which is bad for you. Allah knows but you do not know."" [Al-Baqarah 2:216]\n\nMay Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1804/is-ones-spouse-written-in-islam
