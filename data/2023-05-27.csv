273675,"There is a juristic principle that was mentioned by the great scholar as-Sa‘di in his Manzumah, which states that the basic principle regarding meat is that it is prohibited. His student Ibn ‘Uthaymin commented on that by noting that this does not refer to live animals; rather the basic principle concerning live animals is that they are permissible. Rather this basic principle refers to meat, such as a game animal that fell into water or any slaughtered animal when the one who slaughtered it is unknown. The great scholar al-‘Alwan said something similar when he was refuting this principle, which was mentioned by the great scholar Ibn al-Qayyim, and he rejected it, but he affirmed something similar to the view of Ibn ‘Uthaymin, namely that if there is one reason to regard something as prohibited and another reason to regard it as permissible, then it is to be deemed prohibited. He mentioned the issue of a game animal if it falls into water, and he quoted as evidence to refute this principle the fact that the Sahabah ate the meat of tame donkeys before it was prohibited, when there was no specific evidence to suggest that it was permissible. He stated that there was no dispute among the Sahabah regarding the principle that the flesh of animals is permissible in general. As for the dispute, it arose among those who came after them. The jurists mentioned this principle. Could what is mentioned in their books be understood as meaning that it is general in application, in the sense that the basic principle regarding meat and animals is that they are prohibited? Some of the earlier jurists followed this principle and regarded it as general in application, and some of them put restrictions, as Ibn ‘Uthaymin mentioned that this is applicable to meat but not to the animals themselves.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe basic principle with regard to slaughtered animals and meats is that they are prohibited, so no slaughtered animal is permissible to eat unless we come to know that it was slaughtered in the manner prescribed in Islamic teachings.\nAmong the words of the scholars affirming this principle are the following:\n1.\xa0An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This highlights an important principle, which is that if there is any uncertainty that the animal was slaughtered in the proper manner which would make the meat of the animal permissible, then it is not permissible, because the basic principle is that it is prohibited. There is no dispute concerning this.""(Sharh Sahih Muslim\xa012/116).\n2.\xa0Ar-Rafi‘i (may Allah have mercy on him) said: In principle, meat is not permissible either. Do you not see that if a man slaughtered an animal that is about to die, and he was not sure whether its movement at the time of slaughter was the movement caused by slaughter or it was because it was still alive, in that case we give precedence to the ruling that it is prohibited.""(Fath al-‘Aziz Sharh al-Wajiz\xa01/280).\n3.\xa0Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The second type is that the original ruling is assumed to remain in effect unless there is evidence to the contrary and can be used as proof, such as assuming that the ruling of being in a state of purity is still in effect, or that the ruling of not being in a state of purity is still in effect, or assuming that marriage is still in effect, or assuming that someone is still the owner of something, or assuming that someone is still obliged to do religious duties, until there is evidence to the contrary. The Lawgiver has indicated that the ruling should be in accordance with the assumption when it was stated concerning the game animal: “If you find it drowned, then do not eat it, for you do not know whether it was killed by the water or by your arrow” and “If you find your [hunting] dog with another dog, do not eat [the game animal], for you only said Bismillah for your dog, and you did not say it for the other dog.” As the principle concerning slaughtered animals is that their meat is prohibited, if there is doubt as to whether the condition to make them permissible was met or not, then the game animal remains prohibited, in accordance with the general principle.""(I‘lam al-Muwaqqi‘in\xa0 1/339, 340).\nHe also said: As for the meat of slaughtered animals, it is prohibited except those which Allah and His Messenger have permitted. If it so happens that there are two reasons, one reason to say that it is prohibited and another to say that it is permissible, we should assume that it is prohibited. That is more appropriate, for three reasons:\n\nTo go along with the basic principle that it is prohibited.\nBecause that is more prudent.\nIf there are two contradictory reasons, they cancel one another out, so we must go back to the basic principle, which is that it is prohibited.""(Ahkam Ahl adh-Dhimmah\xa0 1/538, 539).\n\n4.\xa0Ibn Rajab al-Hanbali said: What is regarded in principle as being prohibited – such as sexual intercourse and the flesh of animals – does not become permissible except on the basis of certainty that it has become permissible through correct slaughter or the marriage contract. If there is any uncertainty regarding any of that, because there is cause for uncertainty, then we must go back to the original principle and base the ruling on it. So in the case of that which is regarded in principle as being prohibited, we deem it to be prohibited.\nHence the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade eating the game animal on which the hunter finds the mark of an arrow that is not his, or with which he finds a dog other than his dog, or he finds it after it has fallen into water, and he explained that the reason for that is that he does not know whether the animal died due to the cause which would make it permissible, or any other cause.""(Jami‘ al-‘Ulum wa’l-Hikam\xa0p. 93).\n5.\xa0Shaykh ‘Abd ar-Rahman as-Sa‘di\xa0 (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Manzumat al-Qawa‘id:\nThe basic principle regarding sexual intercourse and animal flesh, and lives and wealth that are protected by Islamic law is that they are prohibited unless there is a change which makes them permissible. So you should understand what I say, may Allah guide you.\nThen he (may Allah have mercy on him) said, explaining that:\nThat is, the general principle regarding these things is that they are prohibited, unless we are certain that a change has occurred which makes them permissible.\nThe basic principle regarding sexual intercourse is that it is prohibited. It is not permissible except when there is certainty that it has become permissible, either by means of a valid marriage contract or concubinage.\nThe same applies to animal flesh; the basic principle is that it is prohibited, except when there is certainty that it has become permissible.\nTherefore if two factors are found in an animal, one of which indicates that it has become permissible and the other indicates that it has become prohibited to eat it, the prohibition takes precedence, so the slaughtered animal or game animal is not permissible in that case.""(Al-Majmu‘ah al-Kamilah li Mu’allafat ash-Shaykh as-Sa‘di: al-Fiqh\xa0 1/142).\n6.\xa0Shaykh Muhammad ibn Salih al-‘Uthaymin said: The basic principle regarding the flesh of slaughtered animals is that it is prohibited, unless we know how it was slaughtered and whether it was slaughtered in the manner prescribed in Islamic teachings. That is because one of the conditions of it being permissible is that it should be slaughtered in the prescribed manner.""(Fatawa as-Sayd (p. 26-27), ed. ‘Abdullah at-Tayyar.\nSecondly:\nSome scholars may say that what the basic principle regarding animals – that they are prohibited – refers to is the flesh of slaughtered animals, and that it must be proven that the animal was slaughtered in the prescribed manner; it does not refer to the live animal.\nAn example of that is the words of al-Khattabi (may Allah have mercy on him): The animal in principle is prohibited, unless we are certain that it was slaughtered or hunted in the prescribed manner. Therefore it cannot become permissible if there is any doubt concerning that.""(Ma‘alim as-Sunan\xa0 4/282).\nAsh-Shatibi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The basic principle regarding sexual intercourse is that it is not allowed except by the prescribed means, and the basic principle regarding animals is that eating their meat is not allowed, unless they were slaughtered or hunted in the prescribed manner. And there are other similar issues that are prescribed in Islamic teachings.""(Al-Muwafaqat\xa0 1/401).\nThirdly:\nWith regard to live animals, the basic principle is that they are permissible, apart from those which are excluded, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{It is He who created for you all of that which is on the earth}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:29].\nThis indicates that the basic principle regarding things is that they are permissible – which includes animals, plants and other things – unless there is proof that they are prohibited, such as the prohibition on eating them, as it is prohibited to eat pigs and tame donkeys, and it is prohibited to eat any carnivore that has fangs or any bird that has talons; or it is prohibited to kill them, such as the prohibition on killing hoopoes and sparrowhawks; or there is a command to kill it, such as the command to kill snakes and rats; or it is proven to be harmful; or it is regarded as filthy, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{he makes good things lawful to them and bad things unlawful}\xa0[al-A‘raf 7:157].\nIn al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (18/336) it says:\nWhat is permissible to eat of animals is difficult to list. The basic principle is that they are all permissible in general, apart from those which are excluded below:\n\nPigs. They are prohibited according to the texts of the Qur’an and Sunnah, and scholarly consensus.\n\nThe scholars differed regarding other animals. The majority of jurists are of the view that it is not permissible to eat any carnivore that has fangs, such as lions, tigers, leopards, wolves, dogs and so on, or any bird that has talons, such as kestrels, falcons, vultures, eagles, gyrfalcons and so on, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade every carnivore that has fangs and every bird that has talons.\nThen the scholars differed as to whether some particular animals are permissible or prohibited, such as horses, hyenas, foxes, all types of crows, and so on. For more detail, please see the topic “Foods.”\nOne of the views of the Maliki madhhab is that all animals may be eaten, from elephants to ants and worms, and so on, except humans and pigs, which are prohibited according to scholarly consensus.\nSimilarly, in their view – according to one report – no kinds of birds are prohibited. This was the view of al-Layth, al-Awza‘i and Yahya ibn Sa‘id. They quoted as evidence the general meaning of the verses which permit eating animals, and the view of Abu’d-Darda’ and Ibn ‘Abbaas, which is that what Allah did not mention is pardoned.\n\nThat which we are commanded to kill,\n\nsuch as snakes, scorpions and rats, and all harmful carnivores such as lions and wolves, and other creatures mentioned above.\n\nThings that are regarded as filthy.\n\nOne of the guidelines on what is permissible and what is prohibited is that we should pay attention to what is regarded as good and wholesome, and what is regarded as bad and filthy. Ash-Shafa‘i (may Allah have mercy on him) thought that this was the greatest and most comprehensive of guidelines. The basic principle regarding that is the verses in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{he makes good things lawful to them and bad things unlawful}\xa0[al-A‘raf 7:157]\n{They ask you, [O Muhammad], what has been made lawful for them. Say, ""Lawful for you are [all] good foods…}\xa0[al-Ma’idah 5:4].\nSee: al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (5/132-147), in which there is a detailed discussion about land animals, which are of thirteen types, as well as the difference of scholarly opinion concerning them.\nConclusion:\nThe differentiation between live animals and the flesh of animals or slaughtered animals, is something that is well known and is clear. The basic principle regarding live animals is that they are permissible, in contrast to the flesh of animals or slaughtered animals, regarding which the basic principle is that they are prohibited.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Is the basic principle regarding the flesh of animals that it is permissible or prohibited?\nHe replied: The basic principle regarding the flesh of animals is that it is prohibited, not that animals are prohibited. The basic principle regarding live animals is that they are permissible, and the basic principle regarding the flesh of animals is that it is prohibited unless we know or think it most likely that they are permissible.\nWhat this means is: if we are uncertain as to whether this animal is permissible or prohibited, then it is permissible, and if we slaughter it in the prescribed manner we may eat it. But if we are uncertain as to whether this meat was slaughtered in the prescribed manner or died of other causes, then the basic principle is that it is prohibited, unless we think it most likely that it is halal and permissible…""(Liqa’ al-Bab al-Maftuh\xa0 234/9).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/273675/the-basic-principle-regarding-animals-is-that-they-are-permissible-but-in-the-case-of-slaughtered-animals-and-their-meat-the-basic-principle-is-that-they-are-prohibited
158668,"I was reading a book of jurisprudence and I came across the idea of major intangible impurity. It said that this includes shirk, disbelief and major sins… Then it mentioned minor impurity, and said that it includes invalidating wudu’ and minor sins, et cetera. How sound is this categorisation? Did any of the early generations say this? I hope that you can explain in detail.","['Praise be to Allah.Purity (taharah) is of two types: tangible purity and intangible purity. Impurity (najasah) is also of two types: tangible impurity and intangible impurity.\nTangible impurity is things that the Lawgiver has deemed to be impure and filthy. This includes that of which the impurity is major, namely dogs, and that of which the impurity is minor, such as the urine of an infant boy. It also includes that of which the impurity is moderate, such as the impurity of urine, blood and dead animals.\nThe discussion about purity and impurity in a real, physical sense is what the jurists focus on in their books.\nWith regard to intangible impurity, that is not the focus of the jurists, hence they only mention it rarely, by way of elaboration.\nIntangible purity is the purity of the believer, who is free of shirk and disbelief. Intangible impurity is the impurity of disbelief, evildoing and sin.\nOne of the religious texts which refer to intangible purity and impurity is the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And [mention] when the angels said, “O Mary, indeed Allah has chosen you and purified you and chosen you above the women of the worlds”}\xa0[Al ‘Imran 3:42].\nIbn Jarir at-Tabari said: The words {and purified you} mean: He purified your faith of the doubts and false notions that are found in the faith of other women.""(Tafsir at-Tabari\xa0 5/392).\nAnd Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Take, [O, Muhammad], from their wealth a charity by which you purify them and cause them increase, and invoke [Allah’s blessings] upon them. Indeed, your invocations are reassurance for them. And Allah is Hearing and Knowing}\xa0[at-Tawbah 9:103].\nAt-Tabari said: Here Allah, may He be exalted, says to His Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): O Muhammad, take from the wealth of these people who have admitted their sins and repented from them charity in order to purify them from the taint of their sins, {and cause them increase} that is, develop them and elevate them above the lowly status of the hypocrites to the status of sincere people.""(Tafsir at-Tabari\xa0 11/659).\nAnd Allah, may He be exalted, said to the wives of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him):\n{And abide in your houses and do not display yourselves as [was] the display of the former times of ignorance. And establish prayer and give zakah and obey Allah and His Messenger. Allah intends only to remove from you the impurity [of sin], O people of the [Prophet\'s] household, and to purify you with [extensive] purification}\xa0[al-Ahzab 33:33].\nWhat is meant here is intangible purification.\nAnd Allah said regarding the people of Lut:\n{But the answer of his people was not except that they said, “Expel the family of Lot from your city. Indeed, they are people who keep themselves pure”}\xa0[an-Naml 27:56].\nThat is, they kept themselves pure from sins and abhorrent deeds.\nAnd Allah says:\n{O you who have believed, indeed the polytheists are unclean, so let them not approach al-Masjid al-Haram after this, their [final] year}\xa0[at-Tawbah 9:28].\nIbn al-Qayyim said: Allah, may He be glorified, describes shirk, zina and homosexuality as impure and evil in His Book, to the exclusion of other sins, even if those sins may also be described as impure, as the Qur’an says:\n{O you who have believed, indeed the polytheists are unclean}\xa0[at-Tawbah 9:28].\nAnd He, may He be exalted, says regarding homosexuality:\n{And to Lot We gave judgement and knowledge, and We saved him from the city that was committing wicked deeds. Indeed, they were a people of evil, defiantly disobedient}\xa0[al-Anbiya’ 21:74].\nAnd the homosexuals said:\n{“Expel the family of Lot from your city. Indeed, they are people who keep themselves pure”}\xa0[an-Naml 27:56].\nThus in addition to their shirk and disbelief, they affirmed that they were evil and vile people, and that Lut and his family were people who kept themselves pure of that by avoiding it.\nAnd Allah, may He be exalted, says regarding those who commit zina:\n{Wicked women are for wicked men, and wicked men are for wicked women}\xa0[an-Nur 24:26].\nThe impurity of shirk is of two types: major impurity and minor impurity.\nMajor impurity is the impurity of major shirk, which Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, does not forgive.\nMinor impurity is the impurity of minor shirk, such as a little showing off and pretending in front of other people, or swearing by a created being, or fearing him or putting one’s hope in him…\nThe point is that impurity may sometimes be tangible and visible, and may sometimes be intangible and hidden.\nEnd quote from Ighathat al-Lahfan min Masa’id ash-Shaytan (1/59).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said: What is meant by purification is cleanliness and keeping oneself free of dirt. In Islamic teaching it is of two types: intangible purity and tangible purity.\nAs for intangible purity, it is purity of the heart, which is free from shirk and innovations in worshipping Allah, and also free from rancour, grudges, envy, resentment and hatred, and other such attitudes when dealing with other people who do not deserve that.…\nHence Allah, may He be glorified and exalted described the polytheists as being unclean or impure, as He, may He be exalted, says:\n{O you who have believed, indeed the polytheists are unclean}\xa0[at-Tawbah 9:28].\nAnd the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) stated that the believer cannot be impure, as he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The believer does not become impure.” This is what the believer should pay great attention to in order to purify his heart of it.""(Fiqh al-‘Ibadat\xa0p. 97).\nShaykh Salih al-Fawzan said: Intangible purity means being free of shirk, free of innovations and free of sins. Allah, may He be exalted, says:\n{Indeed, they are men who keep themselves\xa0[al-A‘raf 7:82].\nIn this instance, purity is intangible and refers to avoiding acts of disobedience and sin.\nShirk is also impure. Allah, may He be exalted, says:\n{indeed the polytheists are unclean}\xa0[at-Tawbah 9:28].\nThis is also intangible impurity, and Tawhid (affirming the oneness of Allah) is intangible purity.""(Ash-Sharh al-Mukhtasar ‘ala Zad al-Mustaqni‘\xa0 1/52).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/158668/intangible-purity-taharah-and-impurity-najasah
