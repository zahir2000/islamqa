13532,"Is it possible to give the Mushrikun (polytheists, those who associate others with Allah) proof of the oneness of Allah?","[""Praise be to Allah.\nThe entire universe, in the way it is created and the way it is controlled, bears witness to the oneness of Allah :\xa0\n\n{Surely, His is the creation and commandment.

How then are you turning away (from Allah, by worshipping others instead of Him)?} [Ghafir 40:62 – interpretation of the meaning]\n\nThe variety and greatness of these created things, the perfect way in which they are formed, the way in which they are maintained and controlled, all indicate that the Creator is One and that He does as He wills and rules and decides as He wants:\xa0\n\n{Allah is the Creator of all things, and He is the Wakil (Trustee, Disposer of affairs, Guardian) over all things.} [Az-Zumar 39:62 – interpretation of the meaning]\xa0\nAll of the above indicate that this universe has a Creator, that this dominion has a Sovereign, that behind these forms is One Who gives them shape:\xa0\n{He is Allah, the Creator, the Inventor of all things, the Bestower of forms.

Nay, but they have no firm Belief.} [At-Tur 52:35-36 – interpretation of the meaning]\n\nReason, Revelation and the original state of man (Fitrah ) all indicate that this universe has One Who brought it into being, that these created things have a Creator Who is Ever-Living and Eternal, All-Knowing and All-Aware, Powerful and Almighty, Kind and Most Merciful. He has the Most Beautiful Names and Sublime Attributes and He knows all things. Nothing is beyond His control, and there is nothing like unto Him:\xa0\n\n{And your God is One God (Allah), La ilaha illa Huwa (there is none who has the right to be worshipped but He), the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.} [Al-Baqarah 2:163 – interpretation of the meaning]\xa0\nThe existence of Allah is something that is there is no excuse for not knowing.

230874,Is there any hadith from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) which indicates that it is not allowed to eat again shortly after eating?,"['Praise be to Allah.We do not know of any hadith from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) which indicates that it is not allowed to eat again shortly after eating. This is more akin to the words of doctors, and in fact is something that is known from their words.\nBut the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) urged us to eat and drink little, and told us that a person should not eat more than he needs. He (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The son of Adam does not fill any vessel worse than his stomach. It is sufficient for the son of Adam to eat a few mouthfuls, to keep him going. If he must do that (fill his stomach), then let him fill one third with food and one third with drink, and leave one third for breathing.” Narrated and classed as sahih by al-Tirmidhi (2380); also classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih at-Tirmidhi.\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) told us that a few mouthfuls are sufficient to keep him going, and that does not undermine his strength or weaken him. If he does eat more than that, then let him eat what is will fill one third of his stomach, and leave the second third for water and the last third for breathing. This is what is most beneficial for the body and the heart. For if the stomach is filled with food, it leaves little room for drink, and if he follows the food with drink, it will leave little room for breathing, and will cause him to become exhausted and tired from carrying it, like one who carries a heavy load. This is in addition to what that causes of corruption to the heart (in a spiritual sense), making one find it physically difficult to do acts of worship, and provoking desires which must be fulfilled. So filling the stomach with food is harmful both spiritually and physically.\nEnd quote from Zad al-Ma‘ad (4/17).\nAs-Safarini (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Ghidha’ al-Albab (2/110):\nThe one who eats must allocate one third [of his stomach] for food, one third for drink and one third for air, in compliance with the instructions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), who was compassionate and sincere to all people, and that guided us to what is beneficial in both religious and worldly terms… al-Harith ibn Kaladah, the physician of the Arabs, said: “Healthy eating is the best medicine and corpulence is the main cause of illness.” Al-Harith also said: “What kills people and dooms predators is eating again shortly after eating before having digested properly.”\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/230874/is-there-anything-in-the-sunnah-to-indicate-that-it-is-not-allowed-to-eat-again-shortly-after-eating

If We pardon some of you, We will punish others amongst you because they were Mujrimun (disbelievers, polytheists, sinners, criminals, etc.)} [At-Tawbah 9:65-66]\nThe obligation to denounce mockery of Islam\nWhat the one who is present in such a gathering must do is denounce that. If he cannot do that, then he must leave the gathering, so that he will not be a partner in the sin. If he expresses any kind of approval of their actions and words, then he is like them. Allah, may He be Exalted, Says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And when you (Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) see those who engage in a false conversation about Our Verses (of the Quran) by mocking at them, stay away from them till they turn to another topic. And if the devil causes you to forget, then after the remembrance sit not you in the company of those people who are the Dhalimun (polytheists and wrongdoers, etc.)} [Al-An`am 6:68]\n{And it has already been revealed to you in the Book (this Quran) that when you hear the Verses of Allah being denied and mocked at, then sit not with them, until they engage in a talk other than that; (but if you stayed with them) certainly in that case you would be like them. Surely, Allah will collect the hypocrites and disbelievers all together in Hell.} [An-Nisa’ 4:140]\xa0\nAllah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, regards the one who sits in a gathering and witnesses evil, if he does not denounce it, as being like the one who does or speaks that evil.\xa0\nHence it is said that the one who listens is the partner of the one who backbites. According to a report, the one who witnesses sin but hates it is like the one who was absent from it, and the one who was absent from it but approves of it is like the one who witnessed it.\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhen some of them made fun of (the believers) and said concerning those with whom Allah is pleased, “We have never seen anyone like our people who are well-versed in the Quran when it comes to eating more or telling more lies or being more cowardly when meeting the enemy,” Allah revealed the words (interpretation of the meaning):\n{The hypocrites fear lest a Surah (chapter of the Quran) should be revealed about them, showing them what is in their hearts. Say: ""(Go ahead and) mock! But certainly Allah will bring to light all that you fear.’\nIf you ask them (about this), they declare: ‘We were only talking idly and joking.’ Say: `Was it at Allah, and His Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) and His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that you were mocking?\nMake no excuse; you have disbelieved after you had believed. If We pardon some of you, We will punish others amongst you because they were Mujrimun (disbelievers, polytheists, sinners, criminals, etc.)} [Al-Tawbah 9:66]\nAllah informed them that they had disbelieved after having believed, even though they said, “We say words of disbelief without believing in them; rather we were just talking idly and joking.” He explained that mocking the revelations of Allah constitutes disbelief, and such words cannot be uttered except by someone who is content with such words, for if he had faith in his heart, it would have prevented him from saying such words. (End quote from Al-Iman, 2/284)\xa0\nThe dangers of making fun of Islamic Teachings\xa0\nUndoubtedly making fun of any aspect of Islam is contrary to respect and veneration for this religion, especially with regard to matters such as the punishment on the Day of Resurrection, or in the grave, or the terrors of the resurrection. Islam has only told us of these things so as to alarm people and set their hearts straight, so that they will not persist in heedlessness. One of the greatest forms of heedlessness, which is indicative of being overwhelmed by ignorance, whims and desires, and lack of insight, is when one regards matters of exhortation and admonition as a joke and something to be laughed at and made fun of.\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said concerning these hypocrites who make fun of Islam:\xa0\nThis indicates that they did not themselves think that they had committed an act of disbelief; rather they thought that that did not constitute disbelief. So Allah explained that ridiculing Allah and His revelations and His Messenger constituted disbelief and meant that the person had disbelieved after having believed. This indicates that they had faith, albeit weak, and they did this prohibited action knowing that it was prohibited, but they did not think that it constituted disbelief. However it was kufr by means of which they became disbelievers, although they did not think that it was permissible. (End quote from Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 7/273)\xa0\nThe one who falls into such error must renew his faith by uttering the Shahadatayn (two declarations of faith) and repent sincerely from what he has done. As for the Shahadatayn, uttering it in the prayer or in the rituals of `Umrah is sufficient.\xa0\nIt says in Kashshaf Al-Qina` (6/181):\xa0\nIf the disbeliever prays or gives the Adhan (call to prayer), he is deemed to be a Muslim, regardless of whether he was originally a disbeliever or had apostatised. End quote.\xa0\nHow to Repent from Making Fun of Islam\xa0\nWith regard to repentance, it is essential to repent sincerely and specifically from that great evil of making fun of Islam.\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Whoever speaks a word of disbelief, even in jest, has disbelieved. He must repent and must believe that he is repenting from apostasy. So he must renew his Islam, for the revelations of Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, and His Messenger, are too great to be mocked or ridiculed. (End quote from Liqa’at Al-Bab Al-Maftuh, 60/12)\xa0\nWhat you have mentioned about your friends is no excuse for you not to alert them to the serious sin that they have committed; rather what you must do is tell them about the ruling on what they have done, so that they may repent to Allah, may He be Exalted, from it, and they may regret it and be careful not to go back to it again.\xa0\nYou can read this message to them, as an answer to your question, and similar answers having to do with the Islamic ruling on that.\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 102871 , 275500 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/221739/how-to-repent-from-making-fun-of-islam
