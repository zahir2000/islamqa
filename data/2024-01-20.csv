120218,"What is your opinion about someone who recites ruqyah, and he is a hafiz of the Book of Allah and is well known for being pious and righteous, and he only recites Quran or what has been narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and he repeats some ruqyahs – such as surahs or verses or what is narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)? So for example, he will recite al-Fatihah one hundred times or more, without believing that the number of repetitions – whether it is small or great – will bring about healing. What is the ruling on this repetition, and is it an innovation (bid‘ah) or not?","['Praise be to Allah.I think that there is nothing wrong with repeating the recitation, whether it is a specific number of times or without counting, because the Quran is healing for what is in people’s hearts, and it is guidance and mercy for the believers, whilst it only increases the wrongdoers in loss. So he should use recitation of the Book of Allah, or reciting supplications narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and that will be a beneficial remedy, by Allah’s leave. Moreover, the reciter should be sincere and the patient should be righteous, and they should bear in mind the meanings of the verses and supplications that he recites, and both the reciter and the patient should be righteous, and Allah is the healer.

49039,Is it correct for a sinner to justify his falling into sin by saying that this is what Allah has decreed for him?,"['Praise be to Allah.Belief in Al-Qadar is no excuse for failing to do obligatory duties\xa0\nSome sinners and some who fall short (in religious commitment) make excuses for their shortcomings and sins by saying that Allah is the One Who has decreed this for them, so they should not be blamed for it.\xa0\nWhat they say is not correct under any circumstances. There can be no doubt that belief in Al-Qadar is no excuse for failing to do obligatory duties or committing sins, according to the consensus of the Muslims and all those who are wise.\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“No one has the right to make excuses for sin by referring to Al-Qadar , according to the consensus of the Muslims and the followers of other religions, and all those who are wise. If this were acceptable, then anyone could do whatever crosses his mind of murder, seizing people’s wealth and any kind of spreading mischief in the land, and quote Al-Qadar as his excuse. If a person who quotes Al-Qadar as an excuse were attacked by another person who also quoted Al-Qadar as an excuse for that, he would not accept that, and thus he would contradict himself, which in itself is proof that this logic is false. So using Al-Qadar as an excuse is clearly flawed, as is obvious to anyone who has any common sense.” (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 8/179)\xa0\nShari`ah and common sense indicate that it is invalid to give Al-Qadar as an excuse for committing sin\nBoth the texts of Shari`ah and common sense indicate that it is invalid to give Al-Qadar as an excuse for committing sin or not doing obligatory actions.\xa0\nThe evidence of Shari`ah includes the following:\xa0\n\nThe verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n\n“Those who took partners (in worship) with Allah will say: ‘If Allah had willed, we would not have taken partners (in worship) with Him, nor would our fathers, and we would not have forbidden anything (against His Will).’ Likewise belied those who were before them, (they argued falsely with Allah’s Messengers), till they tasted Our Wrath. Say: ‘Have you any knowledge (proof) that you can produce before us? Verily, you follow nothing but guess and you do nothing but lie’.”\xa0 [Al-An`am 6:148]\xa0\nThese polytheists quoted Al-Qadar as an excuse for their Shirk, but if their excuse had been valid Allah would not have caused them to taste His Wrath. Whoever gives Al-Qadar as an excuse for sin and shameful behaviour might as well justify the ways of the disbelievers and attribute injustice to Allah as well – Exalted be Allah far above that.\xa0\n\nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n\n“Messengers as bearers of good news as well as of warning in order that mankind should have no plea against Allah after the (coming of) Messengers. And Allah is Ever All-Powerful, All-Wise.” [An-Nisa’ 4:165]\xa0\nIf Al-Qadar were an acceptable excuse for committing sin, definitive proof would not have been established by the sending of the Messengers, and indeed there would have been no point in sending the Messengers.\xa0\n\nAllah issues commands and prohibitions to His slaves, but He does not burden them with more than they can bear:\xa0\n\n“So keep your duty to Allah and fear Him as much as you can.” [At-Taghabun 64:16]\xa0\n“Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope.” [Al-Baqarah 2:286]\xa0\nIf a person were forced to do things, he would be obliged to do things over which he had no control and this is not right. Hence whatever wrongs he commits due to ignorance or being compelled to do them, there is no sin on him for that, because he has an excuse. If this excuse (of Al-Qadar) were valid, then there would be no difference between one who is forced to do something, one who is ignorant and one who does it deliberately. But what is in fact known from real life and basic common sense, is that there is a great difference between them.\xa0\n\nAl-Qadar is something secret and concealed which no one in creation knows until it has come to pass. When a person does something, his will precedes his action, so his will to do it is not based on knowledge of the decree of Allah. So his claim that Allah has decreed that he should do such and such is a false claim, because it is a claim to have knowledge of the unseen, but no one knows the unseen except Allah. So this argument is flawed, because no man can base his evidence on something of which he knows nothing.\xa0\nQuoting Al-Qadar as an excuse for sin implies that the laws of Allah are pointless and that the reckoning, resurrection, and reward and punishment will not happen.\xa0\nIf Al-Qadar were a valid excuse for sin, the people of Hell would have used it, when they see the punishment and realise that they are going to fall into it and when the angels start to rebuke them. But in fact they do not use it as an excuse, rather they say – as Allah tells us (interpretation of the meaning) – \xa0\n\n“ ‘Our Lord! Respite us for a little while, we will answer Your Call and follow the Messengers!’” [Ibrahim 14:44]\xa0\n“‘Our Lord! Our wretchedness overcame us.’” [Al-Mu’minun 23:106]\xa0\n“‘Had we but listened or used our intelligence, we would not have been among the dwellers of the blazing Fire!’” [Al-Mulk 67:10]\xa0\n“We were not of those who used to offer the prayers.” [Al-Muddaththir 74:43], etc.\xa0\nIf Al-Qadar were a justifiable excuse for sin, they would use it, for they are in the most desperate need of an excuse that would save them from the Fire of Hell.\xa0\n\nIf Al-Qadar were a valid excuse for sin, it would have been an excuse for satan who said:\xa0\n\n“ ‘Because You have sent me astray, surely, I will sit in wait against them (human beings) on Your straight path’” [Al-A`raf 7:16 – interpretation of the meaning]\xa0\nAnd Pharaoh the enemy of Allah would have been equal with [Prophet] Musa (peace be upon him), the one with whom Allah spoke.\xa0\n\nAnother point that refutes this argument and demonstrates it to be invalid, is the fact that we see how people are keen to get what benefits them in this world. You never see anyone who ignores worldly things that are good for him and doing things that harm him on the grounds that this is what Allah has decreed. Why would anyone turn away from that which will benefit him in spiritual terms and turn to that which will harm him, and then claim that this is what Allah has decreed for him?\xa0\n\nI will give some examples which will clarify that for you: if a person wants to travel to some country, and there are two routes to this country, one of which is safe and secure, and the other is remote and dangerous, with the risk of murder and robbery, which route will he take?\xa0\nUndoubtedly he will take the first route. So why, with regard to the Hereafter, does he not take the road to Paradise and avoid the road to Hell?\xa0\n\nAnother point that may be used to refute the one who quotes Al-Qadar as evidence, is to follow his own line of reasoning and tell him: “Do not get married, and if Allah has decreed that you should have a son, you will have one, otherwise you will never have a child. Do not eat or drink, and if Allah has decreed that you should be satisfied, that will happen, otherwise it will never happen. If a wild animal attacks you, do not run away from it, and if Allah has decreed that you should be saved, then you will be, and if He has not decreed that you will be saved, running away will not help you. If you fall sick, do not seek treatment, and if Allah has decreed that you will recover then you will do so, but if He has not then medicine will never help you.”\xa0\n\nWill he agree with such comments or not? If he agrees with us, then we will know that his reasoning is not sound. If he disagrees with us, we will know that what he says and the excuses he gives are not valid.\xa0\n\nThe one who quotes Al-Qadar as an excuse for sin is likening himself to the insane and minors, who are not accountable and will not be taken to task, but if he were to be treated as they are in this world he would not accept that.\xa0\nIf we accept this excuse, there would be no need to pray for forgiveness, or repent, or make Du`aa’, or strive in Jihad, or enjoin what is good and forbid what is evil.\xa0\nIf Al-Qadar were an excuse for shameful behaviour and sin, then there would be anarchy and chaos. There would be no need for hudud and Ta`zir punishments, or other types of penalties, because the wrongdoer would be able to quote Al-Qadar as an excuse and we would not need to punish wrongdoers and bandits or to have courts and a judiciary system, because everything that happens only by the decree of Allah. But no wise man would say such a thing.\xa0\nThe one who gives Al-Qadar as an excuse says: We will not be taken to task, because Allah has decreed this for us, and how can we be taken to task for something that has been decreed for us?\xa0\n\nWe say to him: We will not be taken to task for that which has already been decreed for us, but we will be taken to task for what we do and earn. We are not commanded to do that which Allah has decreed for us, rather we are commanded to do that which is enjoined upon us. There is a difference between what Allah wills for us and what He wants from us. What He wills for us He has kept secret, but what He wants from us He has commanded us to do.\xa0\nThe fact that Allah knows what we will do from eternity and has written that down is not an excuse, because His all-encompassing knowledge means that He knows what His creation will do, but that does not imply any kind of compulsion. By way of example – and for Allah is the highest description (cf Al-Nahl 16:60) – if a teacher knows that one of his students will not make the grade this year because he is too careless and lazy, then this student fails just as the teacher knew he would, would any wise person say that the teacher forced him to fail, or would the student have any right to say “I did not succeed because this teacher knew that I would never succeed”?!\xa0\nIn conclusion, quoting Al-Qadar as an excuse for committing sin or for not doing obligatory duties is a false excuse, according to Shari`ah, common\xa0 sense and reality.\xa0\nIt is worth pointing out that many of those who use this excuse do not do so out of conviction and faith, rather they base their argument on whims and desires and stubbornness. Hence one of the scholars said to one such person: “When it comes to obedience you are a Qadari and when it comes to sin you are a Jabari; whatever school of thought suits your whims and desires, you follow it.” (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 8/107).\xa0 In other words, when he did an act of worship or obedience he attributed it to himself and denied that Allah had decreed that, but when he committed a sin he quoted Al-Qadar as an excuse.\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said of those who quote Al-Qadar as an excuse:\xa0\n“If these people persist in this belief they will be worse disbelievers than the Jews and Christians. (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 8/262)\xa0\nBased on this, there is no justification for a person to quote Al-Qadar as an excuse for his faults and sins.\xa0\nAl-Qadar may be invoked when calamities befall a person\nAl-Qadar may be invoked when calamities befall a person such as poverty and sickness, loss of a loved one, destruction of crops, loss of wealth, accidental killing, and so on. This is a sign of full acceptance of Allah as one’s Lord. In this case referring to Al-Qadar is only valid when it has to do with calamities, not faults. The fortunate one is the one who seeks forgiveness for faults and is patient in the face of calamity, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“So be patient (O Muhammad). Verily, the Promise of Allah is true, and ask forgiveness for your fault.” [Ghafir 40:55]\xa0\nThe doomed one is the one who panics at the time of calamity and quotes Al-Qadar as an excuse for sin.\xa0\nThe following example will help to explain this further: if a man is speeding in his car and fails to drive safely and causes an accident, then he is blamed for that and called to account, and he gives Al-Qadar as an excuse, that excuse will not be accepted from him, whereas if a person’s car is struck whilst stationary, and another person blames him and he responds by referring to Al-Qadar , this will be acceptable, unless he was parked in the wrong place.\xa0\nThe point is that whatever a person does and whatever choices he makes cannot be excused by referring to Al-Qadar, but whatever is beyond his will and control may correctly be attributed to Al-Qadar.\xa0\nHence Adam and Musa (peace be upon them) disputed, as is described in the Hadith of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) who said: “Adam and Musa disputed. Musa said to him: ‘You are Adam whose sin caused you to be expelled from Paradise.’ Adam said to him: ‘You are Musa whom Allah chose to convey His message and to speak to; are you blaming me for something that Allah decreed for me before I was created?’ So Adam won the argument with Moses.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2652)\xa0\nAdam (peace be upon him) did not quote Al-Qadar as an excuse for his sin as may be imagined by those who do not think about the meaning of the Hadith, and Musa (peace be upon him) did not blame Adam for his sin, because he knew that Adam had asked his Lord for forgiveness and repented, and his Lord had accepted his repentance and guided him, and the one who repents from sin like one who did not sin.\xa0\nIf Musa had blamed Adam for his sin, he would have replied: “I sinned but then I repented, and Allah accepted my repentance,” or he would have said: “You, O Musa, also killed a soul, and you threw down the Tablets,” and so on. Rather Musa referred to the calamity and Adam responded by referring to Al-Qadar. (See Al-Ihtijaj bi’l-Qadar by Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, 18-22)\xa0\nWhatever calamities are divinely decreed, we must accept them, for that is part of full acceptance of Allah as one’s Lord. With regard to sins, no one has the right to sin; if he does commit sin then he has to seek forgiveness and repent, so he should repent from sin and be patient in the face of calamity.” (Sharh At-Tahhawiyyah , 147)\xa0\nCan the one who repents from sin refer to Al-Qadar as an excuse?\nSome of the scholars said that one of those who are justified in referring to Al-Qadar as an excuse is the one who repents from sin, so if anyone blames him for a sin from which he has repented, he may refer to Al-Qadar in this case.\xa0\nIf it is said to one who has repented: “Why did you do such and such?” and he responds by saying, “That happened by the will and decree of Allah, but I have repented and asked forgiveness,” this excuse is acceptable in his case, because in his case the sin is like a calamity that befell him, and he did not quote Al-Qadar as an excuse for his negligence, rather he is referring to the calamity that befell him, which is disobedience towards Allah. Undoubtedly sin is a kind of calamity, and he is referring to Al-Qadar after the sin took place, and he is admitting his sin. So no one has the right to condemn the one who has repented from sin. What matters is how a person ends up, not the shortcomings that he may commit in the beginning.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.\xa0\nReferences:\xa0\n\nA`lam As-Sunnah Al-Manshurah, 147;\nAl-Qada wal-Qadar fi Daw’ il-Kitab was-Sunnah by Shaykh Dr. `Abd Ar-Rahman Al-Mahmud;\nAl-Iman bil-Qada’ wal-Qadar by Shaykh Muhammad Al-Hamd;\xa0\nAnd the summary by Al-Shaykh Sulayman Al-Khurashi of the belief of Ahl Al-Sunnah in Al-Qadar as discussed in his book Turki Al-Hamd fi Mizan Ahl As-Sunnah.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/49039/can-you-quote-al-qadar-as-an-excuse-for-committing-sins
479866,"I work for a company that has contracts with some organisations, and it only accepts payment by electronic means, by passing the cell phone over a magnetic card. When the customer pays the bill, 2% or more of the total amount is added, and this is regarded as a tip for the workers. The customer may pay more as a tip, or he has the option of cancelling the tip and paying the value of the invoice only. But often the customers do not notice that they are paying an additional amount on the invoice. Is doing this haram or halal? What is the ruling on me doing that to them?","[""Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nGiving tips to workers is permissible, subject to two conditions:\n1. That it is done with the consent of the customer.\n2. That it is done with the consent of the company for whom the workers are working. If it is not done with the knowledge and consent of the company, then it comes under the heading of gifts to workers, which is haram.\nPlease see the answer to question no. 143737 .\nSecondly:\nIt is not permissible to collect tips in a way that is not noticed by the customer, because this is consuming their wealth unlawfully. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{O you who have believed, do not consume one another's wealth unjustly but only [in lawful] business by mutual consent}\xa0[an-Nisa’ 4:29].\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “It is not permissible to take someone’s wealth except with his willing consent.” Narrated by Ahmad (20172); classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Ahmad (7662).\nTips are to be regarded as a gift that is given willingly, and they are not valid unless they are given with the consent of the giver who is an adult of sound mind.\nIt says in Nayl al-Ma’arib bi Sharh Dalil at-Talib (2/28) in the chapter on gifts:\nThere are eight conditions [for giving of gifts]:\n1. The gift should be given by someone who is permitted to dispose of his wealth, meaning that he should be free [not a slave], accountable and of sound mind.\n2. It should be given voluntarily, of his own free will. A gift is not valid if it is given by one who is forced and is not joking. In that case, it is not valid…\nIn Majallat al-Ahkam al-‘Adliyyah (no.860) it says: It is stipulated, with regard to gifts, that the giver should be giving it willingly; a gift is not valid if the giver is forced to give it.\nIt says in Durar al-Hukkam Sharh Majallat al-Ahkam (2/399):\nIn order for a gift or charity to be valid, it is stipulated that the giver should give willingly. There are two scenarios in which the giver is not giving willingly:\nThe first scenario is when he is forced and compelled. Based on that, the gift is not valid if the giver is forced to give it and gives it unwillingly…\nThe second scenario is when the giver is prompted to say words indicative of giving in a language that he does not know. If the recipient prompts the giver to say “Wahabtu minka ma li ‘alayka min al-alf [What you owe me of one thousand is a gift for you],” and he says it, but the giver does not understand Arabic and there is no one to explain to him what this sentence means, this gift and waiving of the debt is not valid, if it is done in this way.

205100,I am an employee in a government-run company. My question is whether the health insurance offered by my company is permissible. It can be summed up in the following two points:,"['Praise be to Allah.Difference between cooperative insurance and commercial insurance\xa0\nThe most important difference between cooperative insurance and commercial insurance is that the money deducted for cooperative insurance is not owned by the committee that is administering the fund; rather it remains a donation that is to be spent on whoever meets the conditions.\nIn contrast, the administrators of commercial health insurance funds have ownership of the subscriptions and deductibles paid by the subscribers, and that is included in their personal accounts, in return for the administration committee being committed to treat anyone who meets the conditions. There is a big difference between the two types.\xa0\n\nThe first type is cooperative and offers mutual support, and there is a Hadith that supports it in principle. It was narrated that Abu Musa (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If the Ash`aris run short of provisions during a campaign, or they run short of food for their families in Madinah, they gather whatever they have in a single cloth and share it out equally amongst themselves. They belong to me and I belong to them.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 2486)\xa0\n\nAl-Bukhari included it in a chapter entitled: “Chapter on sharing food and other resources, and how to divide that which may be weighed or measured handful by handful (without weighing it or measuring it), because the Muslims did not see anything wrong with sharing out provisions when traveling so that one could come and have some, and another could come and have some…”\xa0\n\nAs for the second type (commercial insurance ), it is a kind of gambling; all contemporary Fiqh councils are agreed that it is forbidden.\xa0\n\nDifferences between lawful and forbidden cooperative health insurance\xa0\nThere are other essential differences between cooperative health insurance to which it is permissible to subscribe, and that forbidden type of insurance which is based on gambling. It is essential to investigate these differences before issuing a fatwa ruling that any specific case is lawful or prohibited.\xa0\nIt says in Al-Ma`ayir Ash-Shar‘iyyah (p. 372-373):\xa0\nThe reason why cooperative insurance is permissible and commercial insurance is forbidden is the following essential differences:\xa0\n\nTraditional (commercial) insurance is a contract offering something in return for financial compensation; it is aimed at making a profit from the insurance itself, therefore it is subject to the same rulings as other financial transactions, whereby it may be affected by ambiguity. The ruling on traditional insurance is that it is forbidden according to Shari`ah. As for cooperative insurance, it is a commitment to donate and is not affected by ambiguity.\nThe company that manages Islamic insurance [or an insurance fund in some cases, such as that mentioned in this question] is acting as an agent when drawing up the insurance contract. In contrast, the company is a main party in the case of commercial insurance and draws up contracts in its own name.\nIn the case of commercial insurance , the company has ownership of the payments made in return for the commitment to pay out money in the case of illness. In the case of the Islamic insurance company, it does not have ownership of these payments, because these payments become the property of the fund .\nWhatever is left of the payments and their returns – after payment of expenses and compensation – remains in the ownership of the policy holders, and this is the surplus which is to be distributed to them. But this is not possible in the case of commercial insurance, because the payments become the property of the company by virtue of the contract and receipt of the payments. In fact that money is regarded as income and profit in the case of commercial insurance.\nReturns on the investment of monthly subscriptions, after deducting a percentage of the profit for the company (which is investing the fund), go back to the policyholders in the case of Islamic insurance, and they go back to the company itself in the case of commercial insurance.\nIslamic insurance is aimed at creating cooperation between different members of society; it is not aimed at making a profit by selling the insurance. In contrast, commercial insurance is aimed at making a profit from the insurance itself.\nIn the case of Islamic insurance, the company’s profits result from investing its money and its share of the profit in Mudarabah investments, because it is managing the funds and investments, and the fund itself is the owner of the wealth.\nThe one who subscribes and the one who is giving the insurance is the same in the case of Islamic insurance, even though they may be different in practical terms. In the case of commercial insurance, they are two completely different entities.\nIn the case of Islamic insurance, the company is bound by the rulings of Shari`ah and the Fatwas of its Shari`ah committee. In the case of commercial insurance, it is not bound by the rulings of Shari`ah. End quote.\n\nWe know that many of these differences are not relevant when speaking about the fund mentioned in the question, but we have quoted them here so that the reader may understand the real and important differences between cooperative insurance which is permissible, and commercial insurance which is forbidden, and thus will be able to weigh up and judge other types of governmental health insurance funds.\xa0\nHow to issue a Fatwa regarding funds of insurance\xa0\nIn order to issue a precise Fatwa concerning your fund and to try to help you to follow the Shar`i guidelines on cooperative insurance, it is essential that you send us the official documents which regulate the work of the fund, and the contracts that subscribers have to sign, so that we can study them and determine the ruling on them. Although we think it most likely that the way your fund is operated is sound, in sha Allah, we cannot be certain of the ruling before examining the official rules and regulations governing the fund, and the application forms for joining it.\xa0\nThe book Al-Ma`ayir Ash-Shar`iyyah stipulates a number of basic matters which must be stated in the articles of association of cooperative funds, as it says (p. 364):\xa0\n“Islamic insurance is an agreement among people who are exposed to a particular danger to deal with any harm resulting from this danger, by paying subscriptions in the form of a commitment to donate; from that a fund is formed that is a separate, financially independent, virtual entity, from which compensation is paid for harm that may befall one of the subscribers because of some danger against which he was insured, in accordance with the bylaws and contracts. The administration of this fund is handled by a committee chosen from among the policyholders or by a limited liability company in return for a fee paid to administer the insurance and invest the money in the fund.\xa0\nAs for traditional insurance, it is a financial transaction that is aimed at making profits from the insurance itself, subject to the rulings on financial transactions that may be affected by ambiguity; the ruling on traditional insurance is that it is forbidden according to Shari`ah (because of the ambiguity it involves).\xa0\nPrinciples of Islamic insurance\xa0\nIslamic insurance is based upon the following Shar`i guidelines and principles, which must be stated clearly in the company’s articles of association:\xa0\n\nThe commitment to donate, whereby the policyholder donates his monthly subscriptions and the returns on them to the fund, in order to pay compensation. He may also commit himself to pay his share towards covering any deficit, in accordance with the bylaws.\nThe company that is running the insurance fund should have two separate accounts: one which has to do with the company itself and its rights and commitments, and another which has to do with the fund and the rights and commitments of the policyholders.\nThe company is acting as an agent when administering the fund and when investing what is owned by the fund.\nThe insurance account has to do with whatever is owned by the fund and the returns on its investments, as well as other commitments.\nThe bylaws may include a clause dealing with disposal of any surplus according to what serves the interests of the policyholders, provided that the company that is administering the fund does not get any of this surplus.\nIn the event of liquidation, all the money in the fund and any surplus accumulated is to be spent on charitable causes.\nIt is preferred that the policyholders should administer the insurance fund.\nThe company is committed to abide by all rulings and principles of Islamic Shari`ah in all its activities and investments, and in particular is not to insure anything that is forbidden.\nA Shari`ah watchdog committee should be appointed whose fatwas will be binding upon the company.”\xa0\n\nAll of these matters should be paid attention to in the bylaws that regulate the activities of the insurance fund, especially those that invest these subscriptions of the people insured for the benefit of the fund. It is essential to ensure that these principles are present in the bylaws and articles of association governing the insurance.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/205100/difference-between-cooperative-insurance-and-commercial-insurance

Wa in aradta bi `ibadika fitnatan, faqbidni ilayka ghayra maftun (O Allah, I ask You (to enable me) to do good deeds and avoid evil deeds, and to love the poor, and (I ask You) to forgive me, have mercy on me and accept my repentance. If You will that some trial should befall Your slaves, then take me to You [i.e., cause me to die] without having subjected to that trial).” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 3233; Al-Albani said of this Hadith is authentic in Sahih At-Targhib wat-Tarhib, 408)\xa0\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to seek refuge from trials and tribulations because when they come they do not befall the wrongdoers only, rather they befall everyone.\xa0\nDu`a at times of tribulation and hardship\nIt is a good idea to acquaint ourselves with the Hadiths that mention Dhikrs which have to do with trials and tribulations and disasters, so that we may call upon Allah with these words and spread this knowledge and memorize whatever we can of them… and understand their meanings so that we can worship Allah by means of them, because they are the greatest words that can be spoken in these circumstances.\xa0\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Abu Burdah ibn `Abdullah narrated from his father that when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was afraid of some people he would say, “Allahumma inna naj`aluka fi nuhurihim wa na`udhu bika min shururihim (O Allah, we place You before them and we seek refuge in You from their evil).”\xa0(Narrated by Abu Dawud, 1537; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud, 1360)\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 It was narrated from Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to say at times of distress : “La ilaha ill-Allah Al-`Athim Al-Halim, la ilaha ill-Allah Rabb Al-`Arsh Al-`Athim, la ilaha ill-Allah Rabb us-samawati wa Rabb ul-ard wa Rabb ul-`Arsh il-karim (There is none worthy of worship but Allah, the All-Powerful, the Forbearing; there is none worthy of worship but Allah, Lord of the mighty Throne; there is none worthy of worship but Allah, Lord of heaven, Lord of earth, and Lord of the noble Throne).” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 6345; Muslim, 2730)\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The words of relief are: La ilaha ill-Allah Al-`Athim Al-Halim, la ilaha ill-Allah Rabb Al-`Arsh Al-`Athzim, la ilaha ill-Allah Rabb us-samawati wa Rabb ul-ard wa Rabb ul-`Arsh il-karim (There is none worthy of worship but t Allah, the All-Powerful, the Forbearing; there is none worthy of worship but Allah, Lord of the mighty Throne; there is none worthy of worship but Allah, Lord of heaven, Lord of earth, and Lord of the noble Throne).” (Sahih Al-Jami` As-Saghir wa Ziyadatuhu, 4571)\xa0\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) went on a military campaign he would say, `Allahumma anta `adudi wa anta nasiri wa bika uqatil (O Allah, You are my help and You are my support and by Your help I fight).” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 3584; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Tirmidhi, 2836.)\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Shall I not tell you of something that, if any worldly calamity or disaster befalls any man among you and he says these words, he will be relieved of it. (It is) the Du’a’ of Dhu’n-Nun: “La ilaha illa anta subhanaka inni kuntu min Ath-thalimin (none has the right to be worshipped but You (O Allah), Glorified (and Exalted) be You [above all that (evil) they associate with You]! Truly, I have been of the wrongdoers).” According to another report: “No Muslim man says this Du’a’ concerning anything but Allah will answer his prayer.” (Sahih Al-Jami’ As-Saghir wa Ziyadatuhu, 2065)\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to teach his Companions to say these words when they felt afraid: “A’udhu bi kalimat-illah il-tammati min ghadabihi wa min sharri `ibadihi wa min hamazat Ash-shayatini wa an yahdurun (I seek refuge in the perfect words of Allah from His wrath and from the evil of His slaves and from the evil promptings of the devils and from their presence).” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 3893; classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud, 3294)\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The Du’a’ of the person who is in distress is: `Allahumma rahmataka arju fa la takilni ila nafsi tarfat `ayn wa aslih li sha’ni kullahu la ilaha illa anta (O Allah, for Your mercy I hope, so do not leave me in charge of my affairs even for the blink of an eye; rectify all my affairs. There is none worthy of worship but You)’” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 5090; classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud, 4246)\xa0\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 If some matter was troubling him, he would say, Ya Hayyu ya Qayyum bi rahmatika astaghith (O Ever-Living, O Sustainer, by Your mercy I seek Your help).” According to another report: “If some matter worried him or distressed him.” Sahih Al-Jami` As-Saghir, 4791)\xa0\nThe Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: to Asma’ bint `Umays (may Allah be pleased with her), “Shall I not teach you some words which you can say at times of distress and hardship ? `Allahu Allahu rabbi la ushriku bihi shay’an (Allah is my Lord, I do not associate anything with Him).’” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 1525; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud, 1349)\xa0\nAccording to a version narrated in Al-Sahih Al-Jami’, “Whoever is afflicted by worry, distress, sickness or hardship, and says, Allahu Allahu rabbi la sharika lah (Allah is my Lord, He has no partner or associate), will be relieved of that.”\xa0\nAnd there are other Hadiths which will have a positive effect in times of tribulation and fear, bringing peace of mind and physical safety, and drawing one closer to Allah… We should be content with that which has been narrated in authentic reports from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), for that is sufficient and we have no need to report that are not sound. This is better.
