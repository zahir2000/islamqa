107144,"I have completed my Masters Degree in Human Resource Management (HRM) / Personnel Management, which is a specialised branch of MBA. However, now that Allah has guided me to practice Islam I find this qualification a waste, because 1. The jobs that are available based on this qualification invariably entail writing down riba (i.e. helping employees get provident fund, insurance, bank loans etc, keeping records of the riba involved etc) 2. Almost all Human Resource jobs also entail recruiting people – both men and women, and for this it means being alone with a non mahram woman during the interview and even afterwards, for performance appraisals etc, asking about their personal and professional lives. 3. In any case all workplaces with HR departments (without a single exception in my land) are mixed where women make wanton display of their beauty.","[""Praise be to Allah.Haram jobs\nSome jobs are haram in and of themselves, such as working in riba-based banks and places where alcohol is sold . Some may be haram because of things in the work-place that are contrary to Shari`ah, such as mixing between men and women , or because it is stipulated that one should wear haram clothing or do other things that are contrary to Shari`ah, such as shaving the beard . It is not permissible for the Muslim to do either type of job.\nJobs of the second type vary in the degree to which they are haram. The one which incurs the greatest burden of sin is that which involves writing down or recording riba (usury), then that which involves selling or manufacturing haram things , then that in which the workplace environment is haram.\xa0\nThe last category should not be taken lightly, because it has an impact on the religious commitment and conduct of the worker, especially the fitnah of women which was the first fitnah of the Children of Israel and is the most harmful fitnah for the Muslim man, as our Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told us.\xa0\nIf mixing between men and women is something that happens in your country and you can hardly find any job that is free of that, and you think that your being in that job will be beneficial and that you will be able to put a stop to some of that evil and reduce some of it, and you will be able to advise the employees who are under your authority, enjoining them to do what is good and forbidding them to do what is evil as much as you can, and you can take precautions and measure which will help you avoid the fitnah of women – such as hastening to get married if you are not married, not looking at them or being alone with them – and if the work requires you to sit with some of the female employees you can leave the door of the office open and not sit close to them and so on, then we think that your being present in the workplace and achieving some of the interests of Shari`ah and reducing some evils, is better than keeping the workplace devoid of the righteous and leaving it to those who do not pay any attention to religion or to the rulings of Shari`ah, so that these evils become more widespread and it becomes more difficult to fight them. How many teachers and university professors have taught in mixed institutions and Allah has benefited many through them, and warded off a great deal of evil.\xa0\nWe hope by Allah’s grace that you will be one of them.\xa0\nHowever, if you think, after taking the job, that you cannot adhere to your religious commitment and that you are being pulled into haram gradually, then you have no choice but to leave that job immediately. If a person gives up something for the sake of Allah, Allah will compensate him with something better than it, as the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said.\xa0\nHow the Companions earned their living\nWith regard to the ways in which the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) earned their living, there were many ways, including:\n\nTrade, as in the case of Abu Bakr As-Siddiq, ‘Uthman ibn ‘Affan and ‘Abd Ar-Rahman ibn ‘Awf (may Allah be pleased with him)\nAgriculture, whether they owned farmland or worked on the land; many of the Muhajirin and Ansar were involved in this\nSkilled crafts, such as smithery, carpentry and so on\nJobs that were connected to the state, such as teaching, collecting zakah, judging and so on\nEarnings acquired through jihad, such as war booty\n\nBut there is a great difference between the nature of life, professions and handicrafts at that time, and these things as they are nowadays. But every era is different, as they say.\xa0\nDid Prophet Muhammad prefer trade to handicrafts?\nWith regard to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) preferring trade to handicrafts , there is no proof for that, as far as we know. There is a difference of opinion among the scholars concerning this issue. Some of them are of the view that business is preferable, and others say that agriculture is preferable, whilst a third group prefers working with one's hands to earn a living, such as handicrafts and so on.\xa0\nThere is a hadith concerning the virtue of working in trade, but it is not proven. It is the report which says that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Nine-tenths of provision is in trade.” (See As-Silsilah al-Da’ifah, 3402)\xa0\nBest jobs in Islam\nWith regard to the report which speaks of the virtue of manufacturing or handicrafts and trade, it was narrated that Rafi’ ibn Khadij (may Allah be pleased with him) said: It was said: O Messenger of Allah, what kind of earning is best? He said: “For a man to work with his hands and every honest transaction.” (Narrated by Ahmad (17265); classed as hasan by the commentators on Al-Musnad; classed as sahih by Al-Albani in Sahih al-Targhib (1691)\xa0\nIt was narrated from al-Miqdam (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No one ever eats anything better than that which he earned with his own hands. The Prophet of Allah Dawud (peace be upon him) used to eat that which he earned with his own hands.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari (1966)\xa0\nAl-aafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah be pleased with him):\xa0\n“The scholars differed as to the best type of work. Al-Mawardi said: The basic types of earning a living are: agriculture, trade and manufacturing. The most likely view of Ash-Shafi`i is that the best of them is trade. He said: The most correct in my view is that the best of them is agriculture, because it is the closest to tawakkul (putting one’s trust in Allah).\xa0\nAl-Nawawi followed it with the hadith of al-Miqdam (quoted above) and said that the correct view is that the best way of earning a living is by working with one’s hands. If it is also in agriculture, then that is the best way of earning a living, because it involves both working with one’s hands and putting one’s trust in Allah, and it benefits both humans and animals, and because usually some of it is given for free. \xa0\nI say: Superior to that in things that are done using one's hands is what one acquires of the wealth of the kuffar through jihad. This is how the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the Companions earned wealth and it is the noblest way of acquiring wealth, because it is making the word of Allah supreme, suppressing the word of His enemies, and brings benefit in the Hereafter.\xa0\nHe said: If a person does not work with his hands, then agriculture is best for him, for the reasons we mentioned.\xa0\nI say: This is based on the fact that the benefit of agriculture is not limited to the one who practices it. However, that does not apply only to agriculture, rather anything that one does with one’s hands is going to benefit others, because this involves producing things that people need. \xa0\nIn fact that varies according to circumstances and according to individual cases. And Allah knows best.” (Fath al-Bari, 4/304)\xa0\nBased on this, agriculture may be better for one who is more skilled in it than other fields, and manufacturing may be better for one person than for others, and a third person may be better at trading so that is better for him than for others.\xa0\nSo each person should see what kind of work is suitable for him and what he is best at, and strive to benefit himself and the Muslims through this work. And Allah is the Source of strength.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/107144/haram-jobs-in-islam
10903,Are there any signs that indicate that a person’s life ended well?,"['Praise be to Allah.What is a good end in Islam?\nA good end in Islam means when a person was guided before his death to keep away from that which angers the Lord and to repent from sin, and to focus on doing acts of worship and good deeds, and then he died in this good state.\xa0\nOne of the indications of this is the authentic Hadith narrated from Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When Allah wills good for His slave, He uses him.” They said, “How does He use him?” He said, “He guides him to do good deeds before he dies .” (Narrated by Ahmad, 11625; At-Tirmidhi, 2142; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in As-Silsilah As-Sahihah, 1334)\nThe Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When Allah wills good for His slave, He sweetens him.” He was asked: “What is this sweetening?” He said: “Allah guides him to do righteous deeds before he dies, then He takes (his soul) whilst he is in that state.” (Narrated by Ahmad, 17330; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in As-Silsilah As-Sahihah, 1114)\xa0\nSigns of a good end that appear to the dying person\xa0\nThere are signs of a good end, some of which are seen by the dying person as he is dying, and some which may be visible to other people.\xa0\nWith regard to the signs of a good end that appear to the dying person, these are things that give him the glad tidings, as he is dying, indicating that Allah is pleased with him. As Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Verily, those who say: ‘Our Lord is Allah (Alone),’ and then they stand firm, on them the angels will descend (at the time of their death) (saying): ‘Fear not, nor grieve! But receive the glad tidings of Paradise which you have been promised!’” [Fussilat 41:30]\xa0\nThese glad tidings come to the believers when they are dying. (See Tafsir Ibn Sa`di, 1256)\xa0\nThis is also indicated by the Hadith narrated by Al-Bukhari, 6507; Muslim, 2683 from the Mother of the Believers `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever loves to meet Allah, Allah loves to meet him, and whoever hates to meet Allah, Allah hates to meet him.” I said, “O Prophet of Allah, do you mean hating death , for all of us hate death?” He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “It is not like that; but when the believer is given the glad tidings of the mercy and pleasure of Allah, and His Paradise, he loves to meet Allah, And when the disbeliever is given the tidings of the wrath and punishment of Allah, he hates to meet Allah and Allah hates to meet him.”\xa0\nAl-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“What this Hadith means is that the love and hate that are referred to here are those that happen when one enters the stage in which repentance is not accepted, where the dying person is told of his situation and he is shown his destiny.”\xa0\nSigns of a good end in Islam\nThere are many signs of a good end , which the scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) have derived from the texts which speak of that. These signs include the following:\xa0\n\nUttering the Shahadah (testimony of faith) when dying.\xa0\n\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “A person whose last words are La ilaha illallah [there is none worthy of being worshipped but Allah] will enter Paradise.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 3116; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawood, 2673)\n\nDying with sweat on the forehead.\xa0\n\nBuraydah ibn Al-Husayb (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say, “The believer dies with sweat on his forehead.” Narrated by Ahmad, 22513; At-Tirmidhi, 980; An-Nasa’i, 1828. (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Tirmidhi)\xa0\n\nDying on the night or day of Friday.\n\nThe Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no Muslim who dies on the day of Friday or the night of Friday, but Allah will protect him from the trial (fitnah) of the grave.” (Narrated by Ahmad, 6546; At-Tirmidhi, 1074. Al-Albani said: When all its Isnads (chains of narrators) are taken into consideration, this Hadith is sound or authentic)\xa0\n\nDying as a fighter for the sake of Allah.\n\nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Think not of those as dead who are killed in the way of Allah. Nay, they are alive, with their Lord, and they have provision.\nThey rejoice in what Allah has bestowed upon them of His Bounty and rejoice for the sake of those who have not yet joined them, but are left behind (not yet martyred) that on them no fear shall come, nor shall they grieve.\nThey rejoice in a grace and a bounty from Allah, and that Allah will not waste the reward of the believers.” [Al `Imran 3:169]\xa0\nAnd the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever is killed for the sake of Allah is a martyr, and whoever dies for the sake of Allah is a martyr.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1915)\xa0\n\nDying of the plague.\n\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The plague is martyrdom for every Muslim.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 2830; Muslim, 1916)\xa0\n`Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her), the wife of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), said: I asked the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about the plague, and he told me that it is a punishment that Allah sends upon whomsoever He will, and that Allah has made it a mercy for the believers, for there is no one who stays in his land at the time of a plague, bearing that with patience and seeking Allah’s reward, knowing that nothing will befall him but that which Allah has decreed for him, but he will be given a reward like that of a martyr.”\xa0(Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 3474)\xa0\n\nDying of a stomach disease .\xa0\n\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “… and whoever dies of a stomach disease is a martyr.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1915)\xa0\n\nDying because of being crushed by a falling wall or by drowning.\n\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The martyrs are five: the one who dies of plague, the one who dies of a stomach disease, the one who drowns, the one who is crushed by a falling wall, and the one who is martyred for the sake of Allah.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 2829; Muslim, 1915)\xa0\n\nIf a woman dies as a result of childbirth, or when she is pregnant.\xa0\n\nThe evidence for that includes the Hadith narrated by Abu Dawud (3111), according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “A woman who dies with child is a martyr.” Al-Khattabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “What this means is if she dies with a child in her womb.” (`Awn Al-Ma`bud)\nImam Ahmad narrated (17341) that `Ubadah ibn As-Samit (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told us about the martyrs and mentioned among them, “A woman who is killed by the child in her womb attains martyrdom, and her child will drag her by his umbilical cord to Paradise.” (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Kitab Al-Jana’iz, p. 39) \xa0\n\nDeath caused by burning , pleurisy and tuberculosis.\xa0\n\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Being killed for the sake of Allah is martyrdom; the plague is martyrdom; drowning is martyrdom; dying of a stomach disease is martyrdom; and the woman who dies in childbirth, her child will drag her by his umbilical cord to Paradise.” (Abu Al-`Awam, the custodian of Bayt Al-Maqdis added: and burning and tuberculosis). (Al-Albani classed it as authentic Sahih At-Targhib wa At-Tarhib, 1396)\xa0\n\nDying to defend one’s religion, wealth or life.\n\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever is killed defending his wealth is a martyr; whoever is killed defending his religion is a martyr; whoever is killed in self-defence is a martyr.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 1421)\xa0\nAl-Bukhari (2480) and Muslim (141) narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “Whoever is killed defending his wealth is a martyr.”\xa0\n\nDying guarding the borders of Islam for the sake of Allah.\xa0\n\nMuslim (1913) narrated that Salman Al-Farisi (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Guarding the borders of Islam for one day and one night is better than fasting and praying at night for a whole month, and if he dies (whilst performing this duty), he will go on receiving the reward for this great deed and his provision (continually), and he will be spared the questioning in the grave. ”\xa0\n\nDying whilst doing a righteous deed.\n\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \xa0“Whoever says La ilaha illallah, seeking the Countenance of Allah thereby, and that is the last of his deeds, will enter Paradise. Whoever gives charity and that is the last of his deeds will enter Paradise.” (Narrated by Ahmad, 22813; Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Kitab Al-Jana’iz, p. 43. See Kitab Al-Jana’iz by Al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him), p. 34)\xa0\nThese are the good signs which indicate a good end, but despite that we cannot be certain that a specific person is one of the people of Paradise unless the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) testified that he will go to Paradise, such as the four Rightly Guided Caliphs.\xa0\nWe ask Allah to grant us a good end.\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 200530 , 135314 , 40671 , 4054 , and 237764 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10903/signs-of-a-good-end-in-islam

118432,"I work as an accountant in a shipping company. Recently I found out that the company for which I work gives bribes to some workers to clear some shipments (get them released from the customs) and the like.

What should I do in this case?","['Praise be to Allah.Is bribery prohibited?\nIt is not permissible to deal with bribes , either accepting them or giving them. This is a major sin, because of the report narrated by Ahmad (6791) and Abu Dawood (3580) (may Allah have mercy on them) from `Abdullah ibn `Amr (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) cursed the one who gives a bribe and the one who takes it.
