314889,"How can we reconcile between the verse {He is not questioned about what He does, but they will be questioned} [al-Anbiya’ 21:23] and the verse {And [mention, O Muhammad], when your Lord said to the angels, “Indeed, I will make upon the earth successive generations.” They said, “Will You place upon it those who cause corruption therein and shed blood, while we declare Your praise and sanctify You?”} [al-Baqarah 2:29]?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nRegarding the angels’ questioning of Allah that is mentioned in Surat al-Baqarah, it was a question aimed at finding out and seeking to understand and learn something new. It was not an importunate question or an objection, for they are far above such a thing, may Allah’s peace be upon all of them. And it was said that Allah, may He be exalted, gave them permission to ask, so they asked.\nMakki said in al-Hidayah (1/216-217): Many of the commentators narrated that the angels were aware that the jinn who dwelt on earth had caused a great deal of mischief and shed blood, so they asked by way of wanting to learn the reason and seeking new knowledge: {Will You place upon it one who causes corruption therein and sheds blood?} In other words, will they be like those who spread mischief?\nThus they asked for the purpose of seeking to learn, not to object, because they had no knowledge of how these successive generations would be, which Allah told them He was going to create. It was said that they said that by way of wondering, as the Arabs say: Will you show kindness to So-and-so, when he mistreats you?\nAnd it was said that Allah, may He be exalted, gave them permission to ask about that.\nAnd it was said that Allah, may He be exalted, mentioned that by way of informing them that He was going to create successive generations on earth, so they asked by way of seeking knowledge: What are those successive generations going to be like? So He said: He [Adam] will have progeny who will spread mischief on earth and shed blood, whereupon they said by way of astonishment and seeking confirmation, not by way of objecting: “Will You place upon it those who cause corruption therein and shed blood?”\nAnd it was said that they said that by way of astonishment at what Allah told them about those successive generations causing mischief on earth and shedding blood. End quote.\nAl-Wahidi narrated in al-Basit (2/324) the views of scholars in response to that, as he said:\nSome of the commentators said that there is an implicit meaning that is stated briefly. What it means is: are You going to place in it those who will spread corruption in it [and shed blood? Or are You going to place in it those who will not spread mischief in it] or shed blood? This is like the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says: {Is one who is devoutly obedient during periods of the night …?} [az-Zumar 39:9], meaning: is he like one who is not devoutly obedient? And it is like the words of the poet Abu Dhu’ayb:\nI went against my gut instinct, for I am obedient to her command, and I do not know whether pursuing her is wise.\nWhat he meant is: is it wise or foolish?\nBased on that, the angels were seeking to understand and perhaps be told something of which they were not aware; it was not their intention to disapprove or object. Then Allah said: {“Indeed, I know that which you do not know”} [al-Baqarah 2:29]. He did not inform them about the character of the sons of Adam and He did not explain to them whether He wanted to create someone who would spread mischief or would not spread mischief.\nIt was said that when Allah said {“Indeed, I will make upon the earth successive generations”}, the angels did not know what type of creatures those successive generations would be. They said: O our Lord, will You place on the earth successive generations who will spread mischief like the children of the jinn? Or will You make successive generations from among the angels? For we glorify and praise You. But Allah did not inform them about that, and he said: {“Indeed, I know that which you do not know”} – in other words: among them will be both those who are obedient and those who are disobedient.\nAz-Zajjaaj said, narrating from someone else: what is meant here is that Allah informed the angels that He was going to place on the earth successive generations, and the successive generations were a group of the sons of Adam who would shed blood. Allah gave the angels permission to ask Him about that, and His informing them of that served to further confirm to them that He knows the unseen. It is as if they said: Are You going to create in it people who will shed blood and disobey You? Rather what they should do when they realise that You have created them is glorify and praise You as we do, and sanctify You as we do. They only said that when they were given permission to ask, because Allah, may He be exalted, has described them as doing what they are commanded. End quote.\nIbn Kathir (1/216) said: What the angels said was not by way of objecting to Allah, or by way of envy for the sons of Adam, as some commentators thought. Allah, may He be exalted, has described the angels as {They do not speak until He has spoken} [al-Anbiya’ 21:27]; in other words, they do not ask Him about anything for which they are not given permission.\nWhen Allah told them that He was going to create a new creation on earth, Qatadah said: They already knew that they [the new creation] would spread mischief on earth, so they said: {“Will You place upon it…”}. That was a question by way of enquiring and finding out the wisdom behind that. They said: O our Lord, what is the wisdom behind creating these people, even though some of them will spread mischief on earth and shed blood? For if the purpose is that they should worship You, we already glorify and praise You and sanctify You. In other words, we pray to You and we will not do anything of that manner at all, so why did You not decree that we are enough?\nAllah, may He be exalted, said, responding to this question of theirs: {“Indeed, I know that which you do not know”}. That is, I know that there is a greater purpose in creating such people, which outweighs the mischief that you refer to, which you do not know, for there will be Prophets and Messengers among them, and among them there will be those who are strong and true in faith, martyrs, righteous people, devoted worshippers, ascetics, close friends of Mine, devout people, those who are close to Me, scholars who act in accordance with their knowledge, those who fear Me, those who love Me, and those who will follow the Messengers (blessings and peace of Allah be upon them). End quote.\nSecondly:\nWith regard to the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says: {He is not questioned about what He does, but they will be questioned} [al-Anbiya’ 21:23], it is similar to the verse {Indeed, Allah does what He wills} [al-Hajj 22:13].\nWhat is meant is that Allah, may He be exalted, is the One Who controls His creation in whatever way He wills, for His is the power of creation and His is the command, and it is He Who is in control. Just as He creates them however He wills, blesses whomever He wills, dooms whoever He wills, grants good health to whomever He wills, decrees sickness for whomever He wills, supports whomever He wills, and forsakes whomever He wills, in like manner He rules over His slaves however He wills. Therefore He permits whatever He wills, forbids whatever He wills, allows whatever He wills, and proscribes whatever He wills, for when Allah decrees [a thing], none can reverse His decree.""(Tafsir Ibn Kathir\xa0 1/387).\nIt says in Tafsir al-Wasit – Majma‘ al-Buhuth (6/1102): This is an elaboration on the fact that He, may He be glorified, is one and unique in His divinity and majestic in His Lordship, and in the fact that He questions His slaves about what they do, but He is not to be questioned by them about what He does to them. The great scholar az-Zamakhshari said, commenting on this verse: As it is the case that usually subjects do not question kings about their actions or the way in which they run the affairs of their kingdoms, out of respect and awe, despite the fact that kings are susceptible to error, mistakes and all kinds of mischief, by the same token it is more appropriate that the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, their Creator and Provider, is not to be questioned about what He does, especially when it is known and well established that everything He does is rational and based on wisdom, so it is not possible for Him to make mistakes or do anything abhorrent. End quote.\nAs for people, they will be questioned, because they are His slaves and are obliged to obey Him and act in accordance with His laws which He prescribed for them on the lips of His Messengers, and because of what He has given them of sound reason, which enables them to distinguish truth from falsehood, good from evil, and benefit from harm.\nAmong those of His slaves whom He will question are those whom people associate with Him, such as the Messiah and the angels; so how can those whom they worshipped be deserving of that worship when they too will be questioned by the One God, may He be glorified and exalted? End quote.\nConclusion:\nAllah, may He be exalted, may be asked for the purpose of learning with humility, or He may be asked for the purpose of seeking guidance and knowledge, but He is not to be questioned by way of objection or disapproval of anything that He does, may He be glorified.\nThe question of the angels was a question that was aimed at learning, for they were aware of the rights of their Lord, and they glorified and praised Him, for they are the ones who do not disobey Allah in what He commands them, and they do as they are commanded.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/314889/the-angels-questioned-allah-in-order-to-find-out-and-learn
135314,Is there a supplication that will protect you against a sudden death? What is it?,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nSudden death is one of the things that Allah decrees for some of His slaves, meaning that death comes to a person suddenly, without any respite or warning; rather it comes out of the blue and his soul is taken smoothly, without suffering the agonies of death and its precursors.\nThis is one of the ways of death that have existed since ancient times and has increased in modern times, because of the traffic accidents that are well known today, and the launching of war against peoples and individuals with efficient modern killing machines.\nIn some reports and hadiths it says that the spread of sudden death is one of the signs of the Hour. These reports were classed as hasan by al-Hafiz as-Sakhawi in al-Maqasid al-Hasanah (p. 506). He said: It has many chains of narration which strengthen one another. It was also classed as hasan by al-Albani in as-Silsilah as-Sahihah (5/370); you can read it in the book Ithaf al-Jama‘ah bima jaa’a fi’l-Fitan wa’l-Malahim wa Ashrat as-Sa‘ah (2/236) by Shaykh Hammud at-Tuwaijri.\nSecondly:\nMoreover, a sudden death may be a good thing, or it may be a bad thing, depending on the condition of the one who dies and his standing before Allah, may He be glorified and exalted:\n1.\xa0If the one who dies is one who is righteous and good, with a track record of good deeds and righteous deeds to his credit, which gives hope that he will have a light before him on the Day of Resurrection, then in his case all kinds of death are good, whether it is a sudden death or it comes after suffering the agonies of death. A sudden death is a mercy, kindness and pardon from the Lord of mankind, so he does not experience the pain of dying and the anguish of its agonies, and he does not suffer much sickness. If he experiences that suffering, and his death is not sudden, that will be an expiation for his bad deeds, and will raise him in status before Allah. That is a confirmation of what the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said about the affair of the believer being entirely good, and that the death of the believer is a relief for him from the toil and misery of this world, as it takes him to the bliss of the hereafter.\n2.\xa0But if the one who dies was one of those who fall short in their duties to Allah, or he was an evildoer, oppresser or disbeliever, then in his case a sudden death is a kind of punishment and divine wrath, because death was hastened for him before he could repent, and he was not given any respite so that he could make up for his past negligence and shortcomings. Rather he was snatched by way of punishment and as a result of divine wrath, as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) described it when he said: “Sudden death is a seizing by (divine) wrath.” Narrated by Abu Dawud (3110).\nBecause it is difficult to judge whether one is righteous or is falling short, and people vary in that regard, and some people may go through experiences that make them more pious and increase their fear of Allah, or make them more steadfast and more certain, we find in the reports from the early generations that they had different views regarding sudden death. In the case of one whose fear of Allah is uppermost, and he thinks that he is falling short in his religious duties, he will seek refuge with Allah from sudden death and will hope that Allah will expiate his sins by causing him to go through the agonies of death, whereas in the case of one whose hope of Allah’s vast mercy is uppermost, he will see sudden death as a relief and mercy, and pardon from Allah, may He be glorified and exalted.\nSo when we read what the early generations said about sudden death, it will appear to be contradictory, but in reality there is no contradiction; rather it is two different, valid views.\nIt was narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud and ‘A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with them both) said:\nIt is punishment for the evildoer and relief for the believer – meaning sudden death.""(Musannaf Ibn Abi Shaybah (3/370); as-Sunan al-Kubra (3/379).\nIt was narrated that Tamim ibn Salamah said: A man among us died suddenly and one of the companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him} said that it was a sign of divine wrath. I mentioned that to Ibrahim – and we rarely asked Ibrahim a question but we found an answer with him – and he said: They disliked a sudden death that appeared to be a sign of divine wrath.""(Musannaf Ibn Abi Shaybah\xa0 3/370).\nThirdly:\nWith regard to the marfu‘ hadiths [those that are attributed directly to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)], none of them are sahih except the hadith quoted above, “Sudden death is a seizing by (divine) wrath,” even though some scholars had some reservations about it. Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) suggested that it was narrated via both marfu‘ and mawquf isnads, and he said that Imam al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) indicated that there were some reservations about its\xa0 isnad. See: Fath al-Bari by al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (3/254).\nAs for other hadiths which speak of sudden death as being something praiseworthy or blameworthy, and suggest that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to seek refuge with Allah from it, none of them are sahih.\nHence al-Fayruzabadi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nNothing is proven concerning that.""(Safar as-Sa‘adah\xa0 p. 353).\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\nFourthly:\nThere is no specific supplication for protection against a sudden death that has been narrated soundly from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). What is widely disseminated in chat rooms about a supplication for which the reward of 360 Hajjs will be recorded for the one who says it, and it will protect him from a sudden death, and so on, is false and fabricated, and has no basis in the books of Sunnah. We have previously explained that in the answer to question no. 126635 .\nIt is best for a person to recite the supplication that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to recite:\nIt was narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said:\nOne of the supplications of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was: “Allahumma inni a‘udhu bika min zawali ni‘matika wa tahawwuli ‘aafiyatika wa fuja’ati niqmatika wa jami‘i sakhatika (O Allah, I seek refuge with You from the withdrawing of Your blessing, and the loss of good health, the sudden onset of Your wrath, and anything that may lead to Your displeasure).”\nNarrated by Muslim (2739).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/135314/is-there-a-specific-supplication-for-protection-against-a-sudden-death
172497,"I proposed marriage to a woman, but when I saw her she was very shy, to the extent that I could not see her face because she was so shy. Question 1: is it permissible for me to ask the family of the woman to let me see her and sit and talk to her before completing the agreement and getting engaged? 2. Is it permissible to pray istikharah regarding more than one woman, meaning that I saw two girls for the purpose of marriage, and I like both of them, but I need to pray istikharah to decide which of them is best for me? 3. How should I choose a wife, from the point of view of beauty, lineage and religious commitment?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt is permissible for the suitor to look at the woman to whom he wants to propose marriage, and sit with her and talk to her, even if that happens more than once, so long as he is undecided and his aim is to reach a definitive conclusion, and make sure that both parties are happy to proceed with the marriage. However, it is stipulated that this should take place without them being alone together, and that any conversation is limited to permissible and regular topics.\nOnce he has decided to go ahead with the proposal or not, then the ruling reverts to the original, which is that it is prohibited to look at her, because the reason for it being permitted no longer applies.\nThis is indicated by the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “If one of you proposes to a woman, then if he is able to see that which will encourage him to go ahead and marry her, let him do so.” Narrated by Abu Dawud (2082); classed as hasan by al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar in Fath al-Bari (9/181).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is permissible to look at her repeatedly… If on the first occasion he did not find anything that would encourage him to marry her, he may look a second time and a third. ""(Ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘\xa0 12/21).\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is permissible for a man, if he wants to propose to a woman, to speak to her and look at her, without being alone with her… And if his conversation with her is to do with marriage, housing and her character, to find out whether she knows about such and such, then there is nothing wrong with that, if he wants to propose to her.""(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa\xa0 20/429).\nIn al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (22/17) it says: It is permissible to look repeatedly, if need be, to find out how she looks, so that he will not have any regrets after marriage, because usually this purpose is not achieved with the first glance.\nPlease see the answer to question no. 13791 .\nSecondly:\nThe basic principle regarding istikharah prayer is that it has to do with one matter, which the person may either do or not do.\nTherefore you must decide and choose one of the two options, then pray istikharah based on that choice, and go ahead with the matter. Then if it does not work out for you, then you may pray istikharah again about the second girl, and so on.\nIf you pray istikharah separately for each girl, there is nothing wrong with that. Please see the answer to question no. 130169 .\nThirdly:\nThe Sunnah describes the characteristics of the woman whom a man should be keen to marry, which may be summed up as follows: she should be a virgin, religiously committed, of good lineage, beautiful, and wealthy. That is because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Women may be married for four things: their wealth, their lineage, their beauty and their religious commitment. Choose the one who is religiously-committed, may your hands be rubbed with dust (i.e., may you prosper).” Narrated by al-Bukhari (4802) and Muslim (1466).\nIf the woman has all of these qualities, then that is even better, otherwise you should give priority to the most important of them, and the most important of them is that she should be religiously committed and righteous, as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “This world is no more than temporary joys, and the best temporary joy of this world is a righteous wife.” Narrated by Muslim (1467).\nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: It was said to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): Which kind of woman is best?\nHe said: “The one who makes (her husband) happy when he looks at her, obeys him when he tells her to do something, and does not disobey him with regard to herself or her wealth in a way that he dislikes.” Narrated by an-Nasa’i (7373); classed as hasan by al-Albani in as-Silsilah as-Sahihah (1838).\nSee also the answers to questions no. 72255 , 125907 ,and 96584 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/172497/ruling-on-seeing-the-woman-one-wants-to-propose-to-more-than-once-and-sitting-with-her
