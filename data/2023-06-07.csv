170751,"A young man of good character proposed marriage to me, and I agreed, and we set a date for the engagement, but nothing was done officially. All that happened was that my brother gave him the answer, and his mother came to visit us. At the same time, another young man proposed marriage to me who is of better character than him, and I felt more comfortable with the new suitor. I felt more at ease with him than with the first one. If I agree to marry the second suitor, will I have committed any sin? Please note that I was not completely convinced about the first one.","['Praise be to Allah.Before answering your question, we must first say something having to do with the second suitor: it is not permissible for anyone to propose to a woman to whom his brother [in faith] has already proposed.\nIt was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade outbidding [or undercutting] one another and forbade a man proposing to a woman to whom his brother [in faith] has already proposed, unless the suitor before him gives up the idea or gives him permission [to propose to her]. Narrated by al-Bukhari (4848) and Muslim (1412).\nBut if it so happens that more than one suitor proposes to a woman, because the second suitor, for example, was not aware of the first one, or for some other reason, then there is no blame on the woman for choosing the one who is best suited for her, even if he is the second one.\nIt is soundly narrated in the Sunnah that Mu‘awiyah and Abu Jahm both proposed to Fatimah bint Qays, and when she consulted the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), he advised her to marry a third man, namely Usamah ibn Zayd (may Allah be pleased with him).\nMuslim (1480) narrated from Fatimah bint Qays (may Allah be pleased with her) that she came to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and told him: Mu‘awiyah ibn Abi Sufyan and Abu Jahm have both proposed to me. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “As for Abu Jahm, he is a man who beats women. As for Mu‘aawiyah, he is a poor man who has no wealth. Marry Usaamah ibn Zayd.”\nSo there is no blame on you for accepting the second one and rejecting the first one. The choice should be based on Islamic guidelines. In the answer to question no. 5202 , you will find a description of the ideal Muslim husband.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/170751/a-second-suitor-proposed-to-her-after-the-first-one-is-she-sinning-if-she-accepts-his-proposal
122622,"In a mudarabah partnership, the profits are divided between the financier [investor] and the worker [the one who is running the business] according to the ratio agreed upon between them. My question is: is it permissible, according to Islamic teachings, for the two parties to agree that the worker is to be paid a fixed monthly salary in addition to his agreed-upon share of the profits?","['Praise be to Allah.Mudarabah is a partnership contract between the financier who provides the capital and the worker who runs the business with that capital. One of the conditions stipulated in order for this mudarabah to be valid is that the capital is not to be guaranteed, and the financier is not to be given a specific amount; rather he is entitled to a share of the profits according to what the two parties have agreed upon, and the worker who runs the business with that capital agrees to take in return for his work a percentage as agreed upon between him and the financier.\nHence the scholars are unanimously agreed that it is not permissible for him to take a fixed amount (salary) in return for his work, in addition to his share of the profits, because there may be no profit from the money invested except what he receives as a salary, in which case he will be the only one to gain some profits, to the exclusion of the financier. If he also contributed some capital to the project, then he may receive something in return for his work, if he does the work himself, and the same applies to his partner. This is what we say, and we do not know of anyone among the scholars who disagreed with that.\nThere follow some scholarly views discussing the conditions of mudarabah, highlighting the fact that what is mentioned in the question about the worker receiving a monthly salary is one of the things that invalidate this contract.\n\nShaykh Sayyid Sabiq (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n\nThe following conditions are stipulated in the case of a mudarabah contract:\n1.\xa0The capital should be in the form of currency [gold or silver coins, or cash]. If it is in the form of raw metal, jewellery or trade goods, then it is not valid. Ibn al-Mundhir said: All of those from whom we acquired knowledge are unanimously agreed that it is not permissible for any man to turn money owed to him by another man into capital for investment. End quote.\n2.\xa0The amount of the capital should be known, so as to distinguish the capital that is invested in the business from the profits that will be shared between the two partners according to the agreement.\n3.\xa0The profit should be shared between the worker and the financier according to a known ratio, such as half, one third, and one quarter, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) made a deal with the people of Khaybar that they would work the land in return for half of the yield.\nIbn al-Mundhir said: All of those from whom we acquired knowledge are unanimously agreed that the mudarabah contract becomes invalid if one or both of the partners sets aside for himself a known amount of dirhams. End quote.\nThe reason for that is that if it is stipulated that a specific amount should be given to one of them, the profit may turn out to be no more than this amount, in which case the one for whom it was stipulated will take it and the other will not receive anything, and this is contrary to the objective of the mudarabah partnership, in which the aim is that both parties should benefit.\n4.\xa0The mudarabah contract should be free of restrictions. This means that the financiers should not restrict the worker to trading only in a specific country, or trading only in a specific product, or only doing business at certain times and not others, or only dealing with one particular person, and other such conditions, because stipulating restrictions often defeats the purpose of the contract, which is to make a profit. So there should be no such conditions, otherwise the mudarabah contract becomes invalid.\nThis is the view of Malik and ash-Shafa‘i.\nAbu Hanifah and Ahmad, on the other hand, did not stipulate this condition. They said: As the mudarabah contract is valid when it is free of restrictions, it is also valid when there are restrictions.\n…\nIt is not one of the conditions of a mudarabah contract to stipulate its duration, because it is a permissible contract that may be annulled at any time. It is also not one of its conditions that it must be between a Muslim and another Muslim; rather it is valid for it to be between a Muslim and a dhimmi [non-Muslim living under Muslim rule].\nFiqh as-Sunnah (3/205-207).\n\nAl-Kasani al-Hanafi (may Allah have mercy on him) said, discussing the conditions of the mudarabah contract:\n\nOne of these conditions is that a percentage of the profit – one half or one third or one quarter – should be stipulated for both the worker and the financier. If they stipulate that a certain amount should be given, such as stipulating that one of them will have one hundred dirhams of the profits, or less, or more, and the rest should go to the other partner, that is not permissible and the mudarabah contract becomes invalid. That is because mudarabah is a type of partnership in which the partners share the profits, but this condition means that they will no longer be partners sharing the profits, because there is the possibility that the mudarabah project will not make more than this amount, in which case it will go to one of them and not the other, so it will no longer be a partnership and the deal will no longer be a mudarabah. The same applies if they stipulate that one of them should have half, or one third, plus one hundred dirhams or minus one hundred dirhams. This is not permissible, because mudarabah is a type of partnership in which the partners share the profits, but this condition means that they will no longer be partners sharing the profits, because there is the possibility that the mudarabah project will not make more than this amount, in which case it will go to one of them and not the other, so it will no longer be a partnership and the deal will no longer be a mudarabah.\nBada’i‘ as-Sana’i‘ (6/85, 86).\n\nAsh-Shirazi ash-Shafa‘i (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n\nIt is not permissible for one of them to stipulate that he will receive a certain amount of the profit and the rest is to be shared between them, because the business may not produce that amount of profit, so he will no longer be entitled to anything, or it may not make any profit except that amount, in which case the rights of the other partner will be lost.\nSee: al-Majmu‘ Sharh al-Muhadhdhab (14/366).\nConclusion: it is not permissible for the worker who does business with the capital in a mudarabah project to have a fixed monthly salary; he is not entitled to anything except the share agreed upon between him and the financier.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/122622/is-it-permissible-for-the-one-who-does-business-with-someone-elses-wealth-to-take-a-monthly-salary-from-the-invested-capital-and-some-of-the-conditions-for-doing-that
319879,"I am a young, religiously-committed man, and I pray for forgiveness constantly, praise be to Allah. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says in His Book (interpretation of the meaning):","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt is proven in the religious texts that praying for forgiveness is a means of having a good life in this world, and a means of being provided with wealth and children, and the means of having rain.\nAllah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{[Through a messenger, saying], ‘Do not worship except Allah . Indeed, I am to you from Him a warner and a bringer of good tidings,’\nAnd [saying], ‘Seek forgiveness of your Lord and repent to Him, [and] He will let you enjoy a good provision for a specified term and give every doer of favor his favor. But if you turn away, then indeed, I fear for you the punishment of a great Day’}\xa0[Hud 11:2-3].\nThe commentator Shaykh Muhammad al-Amin ash-Shinqiti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThis verse indicates that praying for forgiveness and repenting to Allah, may He be exalted, from sin are a means of Allah granting to the one who does that enjoyment of good provision for a specified term, because He has made that the consequences of praying for forgiveness and repenting, as a reward for meeting that condition.\nWhat appears to be the case is that what is meant by enjoyment of good provision is abundant provision, a life of comfort and well-being in this world, and that what is meant by the specified term is death. This is indicated by what Allah, may He be exalted, tells us in this surah about the words of His Prophet Hud (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him and upon our Prophet):\n{And O my people, ask forgiveness of your Lord and then repent to Him. He will send [rain from] the sky upon you in showers and increase you in strength [added] to your strength}\xa0[Hud 11:52].\nAnd He, may He be exalted, tells us about Nuh:\n{And said, ‘Ask forgiveness of your Lord. Indeed, He is ever a Perpetual Forgiver.\nHe will send [rain from] the sky upon you in [continuing] showers,\nAnd give you increase in wealth and children and provide for you gardens and provide for you rivers}\xa0[Nuh 71:10-12].\nAnd He, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Whoever does righteousness, whether male or female, while he is a believer - We will surely cause him to live a good life…}\xa0[an-Nahl 16:97]\n{And if only the people of the cities had believed and feared Allah , We would have opened upon them blessings from the heaven and the earth}\xa0[al-A ‘raf 7:96]\n{And if only they upheld [the law of] the Torah, the Gospel, and what has been revealed to them from their Lord, they would have consumed [provision] from above them and from beneath their feet.}\xa0[al-Ma’idah 5:66]\n{And whoever fears Allah - He will make for him a way out,\nAnd will provide for him from where he does not expect}\xa0[at-Talaq 66:2-3].\nAnd there are many similar verses.""(Adwa’ al-Bayan\xa0 3/11-12).\nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 39775 .\nSecondly:\nIf a child or rain is a long time in coming for the one who is praying for forgiveness, it is not appropriate for him to think negatively of his Lord, may He be exalted. Rather he must reflect and think negatively of his own self, for perhaps he is praying for forgiveness without proper focus and humility, or is merely paying lip service to praying for forgiveness, and this is an obstacle to his prayer for forgiveness being answered.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Call upon your Lord in humility and privately; indeed, He does not like transgressors.\nAnd cause not corruption upon the earth after its reformation. And invoke Him in fear and aspiration. Indeed, the mercy of Allah is near to the doers of good}\xa0[al-A‘raf 7:55-56].\nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said: “Call upon Allah in supplication when you are certain of a response, and understand that Allah will not answer the supplication of one whose heart is distracted and heedless.”\nNarrated by at-Tirmidhi (3479); classed as hasan by Shaykh al-Albani in Sahih at-Targhib wa’t-Tarhib (2/286).\nOr perhaps the one who is praying for forgiveness has some sins of which he is heedless, and has not repented from them or sought Allah’s forgiveness for them.\nMoreover, part of the Muslim’s creed is to believe that Allah, may He be exalted, is perfect in His justice, so He does not wrong a person by taking away even an atom’s weight of the good that he has done. He is also perfect in His wisdom, therefore the one who is seeking forgiveness should think positively of his Lord, and not object to His wisdom.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{He cannot be questioned about what He does, but they will be questioned}\xa0[al-Anbiya’ 21:23].\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nHe, may He be glorified, is the Creator, Lord and Sovereign of all things, and He has great wisdom in what He creates; from Him come all the blessings we enjoy and His mercy encompasses all in general, whilst He singles out some for special mercy. He is not to be questioned about what He does, but they will be questioned. This is not only because of His might and power, but because of the perfect nature of His knowledge, His might, His mercy and His wisdom.""(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa\xa0 8/79).\nPerhaps the delay in the arrival of a child or rain is something good for a person; perhaps keeping him on the straight path requires depriving him of some worldly conveniences.\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhat is contrary to rida (contentment with Allah’s decree) is insisting that He do something, believing that He should give you what you are asking Him for and what you want, when you do not know whether that is pleasing to Him or not. This is like one who insists that his Lord should give him such and such a position of authority, or make him rich, or meet his need. This is contrary to contentment with His decree, because he cannot be certain that this is something with which the Lord is pleased.""(Madarij as-Salikin\xa0 3/2033).\nIbn al-Jawzi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe wise person should be content if what he asks for in his supplication is not granted, for if he offers supplication and asks for what he is seeking, then this supplication is an act of worship to Allah. Then if he is granted what he sought, he should give thanks, and if he is not granted what he wants, he should not persist in pursuing it, because this world is not for the purpose of getting what we want. He should say to himself: {But perhaps you hate a thing and it is good for you; and perhaps you love a thing and it is bad for you} [al-Baqarah 2:216].""(Sayd al-Khatir\xa0 p. 625-626).\nMoreover, the supplication of the Muslim is all good. If he is not granted what he asked for in this world, perhaps something bad of which he is not aware may be warded off from him, or perhaps it will be stored up for him until the Day of Resurrection. So he should praise Allah for that.\nIt was narrated from ‘Ubadah ibn as-Samit (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no Muslim on earth who offers supplication to Allah but either Allah will grant it to him, or He will ward off an equivalent harm from him, unless he offers supplication for the purpose of sin or severing ties of kinship.” One man said: Then we should offer a great deal of supplication. He said: “Then Allah will grant you more.” Narrated by at-Tirmidhi (3573), who said: This is a hasan sahih gharib hadith with this isnad.\nAnd it was narrated from Abu Sa ‘id that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no Muslim who offers a supplication in which there is no sin or severing of ties of kinship but Allah will give him one of three things in return for it: either He will hasten to grant him what he asked for, or He will store it up for him in the hereafter, or he will avert from him and equivalent harm.” They said: Then we should offer a great deal of supplication. He said: “Then Allah will grant you more.” Narrated by Imam Ahmad in al-Musnad (17/213). Shaykh al-Albani said: It is hasan sahih, as noted in Sahih at-Targhib wa’t-Tarhib (2/278).\nFor more information, please see the answers to questions no. 229456 and 5113 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/319879/he-constantly-prays-for-forgiveness-but-he-has-not-been-blessed-with-a-child-and-no-rain-has-fallen
