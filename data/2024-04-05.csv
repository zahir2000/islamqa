27026,"On the morning of Eid Al-Fitr, when we reached the prayer place we found that the Imam had prayed and was finishing his sermon, so we prayed the two Rak`ahs of `Eid whilst the Imam was delivering the Khutbah. Was our prayer valid or not?","['Praise be to Allah.`Eid prayer is Fard Kifayah (a communal obligation) ; if enough people undertake it, the rest are absolved of sin.\xa0\nIn the scenario mentioned in the question, the obligatory duty had been discharged by those who prayed first – those to whom the Imam was delivering the Khutbah.\xa0\nFor those who missed it and want to make it up, it is recommended for them to do so, so they should pray it without a Khutbah afterwards. This was the view of Imam Malik, Ash-Shafi`i, Ahmad, An-Nakhi`i and other scholars (may Allah have mercy on them).\xa0\nThe basic principle concerning that is the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “When you come to the prayer, walk in a tranquil and dignified manner, and whatever you catch up with, pray, and whatever you miss, make it up.” \xa0\nIt was narrated from Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) that if he missed the `Eid prayer with the Imam, he would gather his family and freed slaves, then his freed slave `Abdullah ibn Abu `Utbah would stand up and lead them in praying two Rak`ahs in which he would say the Takbirs .\xa0\nThe one who reaches the `Eid prayers while the Imam is delivering the Khutbah should listen to the Khutbah, then he should make up the prayer after that, so that he may achieve two good things.\xa0\nFor more details, please refer to the following answers: 96922 , 36491 , 49014 , 337550 , 36442 , 299437 .\xa0\nAnd Allah is the Source of strength.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/27026/what-happens-if-you-miss-eid-prayer
256212,Is one sinful for not attending the `Eid sermon? And what is the evidence for that?,"['Praise be to Allah.The `Eid sermon is a recommended Sunnah, so its attendance and listening to it are not mandatory.\nThere is no harm for one who has prayed `Eid to leave and not sit for the sermon, and the evidence for this is what Abu Dawud (1155) narrated from `Abdullah ibn As-Sa\'ib, who said: ""I witnessed `Eid with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him), and when he finished the prayer, he said: \'We will give a sermon, so whoever wishes to sit for the sermon may sit, and whoever wishes to leave may leave.\' There is a difference of opinion regarding the connectedness and interruption of this Hadith. A number of Imams, such as Imam Ahmad, Ibn Ma\'in, Abu Dawud, and Abu Zur`ah Ar-Razi opted for the opinion that it is mursal (interrupted). Refer to: \'Al-Musnad Al-Musannaf Al-Mu`allal\' (11/275).\nHowever, the majority of scholars act according to its implications.\nAs-San`ani (may Allah have mercy on him) said in ""Subul As-Salam"" (3/184): ""Consensus has been transmitted on the non-obligation of the sermon in the two `Eids.""

End quote.\nTherefore, the non-obligation of attending the `Eid sermon is agreed upon among the majority of scholars, and here are some statements of scholars from the four jurisprudential schools confirming this ruling:\nAt-Tahawi Al-Hanafi said in ""Bayan Mushkil Al-Athar"" (9/359) after mentioning the aforementioned Hadith:\n""We understand from this Hadith that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) allowed those who prayed with him to leave before attending his sermon after it (i.e., the prayer).

302320,"I love my husband very much. But when I think of all the times we have argued, I feel sad because I wonder if we are still husband and wife. He has said things like “You can go back to your dad’s house and be miserable again.” He said it was not a Divorce. But how can we be so sure if he used the word ‘again’?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe husband\'s statement, ""You can return to your father\'s house and be miserable again,"" his statement, ""If there is violence, it will be the end,"" and his statement, ""I\'m done""... all of these are implicit expressions, and they are not explicit in divorce.\nDivorce does not occur with implicit expressions without intention.\nSo, if your husband says that he did not intend divorce, then divorce does not take place.\nIn the Encyclopedia of Jurisprudence (35/138): ""These implicit expressions and the like may be understood as referring to divorce or may be understood otherwise. The intended meaning is concealed from the listener, and thus they require intention to specify the intended meaning. So his saying: \'You are ba\'in (separate, revocable),\' can mean separation from evil or good or marriage, and \'free\': can mean free from the husband, and marriage, and can mean free from diseases or defects, and \'I have parted from you\': can mean separation from marriage, and can mean separation from the bed or place, and his saying: \'You are innocent (free),\' can mean innocence from marriage, and can mean innocence from evil or good, and his saying: \'Battah (Absolutely),\' from the word meaning \'cutting off,\' can mean cutting off from marriage and can mean cutting off from evil, and his saying: \'Your matter is in your hands,\' can mean divorce, and can mean something else, and so on.\nThere is no disagreement among the majority of Jurists that divorce occurs with implied statements if there is intention.\nThey differed in some issues of implicit divorce...\nThe Shafi`i school of thought holds that divorce occurs with implicit statements if there is intention and does not occur without intention.\nThere are many such expressions, indeed they are innumerable: like \'You are free,\' \'innocent,\' \'absolutely,\' \'separate,\' \'observe your waiting period,\' \'purify your womb,\' \'join your family,\' \'your rope on your own neck,\' \'remain single,\' \'go away,\' \'leave me,\' \'farewell.\'\nThey said: Implicit refers to what can mean divorce and other things, but with the intention to enact it, and with the intention of its words.\nAs for expressions that do not imply divorce except on an unreasonable basis, they have no effect, so no divorce occurs with them even if intended, such as saying: \'May Allah bless you,\' and \'May Allah reward you well.\' End quote.\nSecondly:\nYour husband\'s statement, ""If there is violence, it will be the end"":\nIf he meant divorce when he said it, then this is a divorce contingent on a condition, so if the intended violence occurs, a divorce takes place.\nAnd if he did not mean divorce when he said it—as understood from your question that he first answered you that he did not mean divorce—then divorce does not take place. Even if he intended afterwards that you would be divorced if violence occurred, divorce would not occur, unless he uttered the sentence again intending divorce.\nYou should seek mediation from knowledgeable people who can sit with your husband and make him understand the seriousness of divorce and its rulings; so that he is cautious about being negligent in this matter.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/302320/implicit-divorce
