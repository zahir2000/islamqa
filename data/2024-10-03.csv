178636,"I am a student studying engineering and water management. I am interested in finding out about ways in which we can solve the problem of misuse of water, such as in the case of wudu’, which leads to wasting a lot of water.","['Praise be to Allah.It is important to highlight the beauty of Islam and draw attention to its superiority, and the fact that following its laws and rulings will lead to all that is good. With regard to the issues that a person learns about religious matters, he may think initially that there is something wrong with the religion and that it should be criticised, but then, after thinking and reflecting on its objectives, it will become clear that his initial impression was completely wrong.\nThe way in which Islam deals with the issue of water and its emphasis on being economical with water when purifying oneself and doing wudu’ is based on two things:\n-1-\nIslam is keen for people to purify and cleanse themselves both physically and spiritually. Therefore the believer purifies himself of his sins five times a day when he does wudu’ for every prayer. If the believer does wudu’ five times a day, and washes each body part three times, there is no better way of cleaning oneself than that.\nAn-Nasa’i (103) narrated from ‘Abdullah as-Sanabihi that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When the believer does wudu’ and rinses his mouth, sins come out of his mouth. When he rinses his nose, sins come out of his nose. When he washes his face, sins come out of his face to the extent that they even come out from beneath his eyelashes. When he washes his hands, sins come out of his hands to the extent that they even come out from beneath his fingernails. When he wipes his head, sins come out of his head to the extent that they even come out of his ears. When he washes his feet, sins come out of his feet to the extent that they even come out from beneath his toenails. Then his walking to the mosque and his prayer will earn him additional reward.” Al-Albani classed it as authentic in Sahih an-Nasa’i.\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) spoke of purifying oneself from sins by doing wudu’ and praying, comparing that to cleansing oneself of dirt, when he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “What do you think, if there was a river by the door of one of you and he bathed in it five times a day, would any speck of dirt be left on him?” They said: Not a speck of dirt would be left on him. He said: “That is the likeness of the five prayers, by means of which Allah erases sins.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 528 and Muslim, 667)\nHow beautiful is the likeness that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) gave to highlight the virtue of cleansing oneself of sin through wudu’ and prayer, by likening it to cleansing oneself of dirt with water.\n-2-\nWith regard to being economical in using water when purifying oneself and not being extravagant with it, this issue could be discussed on the basis that Islam calls for being economical and following guidelines on consumption, and tells us not to be extravagant in all things. So the point we should highlight when speaking about Islam and the issue of being economical with water when doing wudu’ is that Islam instructs us to be moderate in all things and not go to extremes in anything, including wudu’.\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAllah, may He be glorified and exalted, sent down in His holy Book verses which speak of extravagance and wastefulness and forbid both, and which praise those who are moderate and righteous in their actions with regard to food, drink and all expenditures.\nSo there should be no extravagance, no waste, no stinginess, no miserliness, no going to extremes and no negligence. Thus Allah prescribes moderation in all things, which includes the prohibition on going to extremes. Therefore people are forbidden to go to extremes, as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Beware of going to extremes in religion, for those who came before you were only destroyed because of going to extremes in religion.”\nAnd Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {O People of the Scripture, do not commit excess in your religion} [An-Nisa’ 4:171]. His forbidding that to them also applies to us. Negligence and falling short are both forbidden; rather we must do what we are obliged to do, refrain from that which is forbidden to us, and strive to do good, without going to extremes or being negligent.\nGoing to extremes means doing more than is prescribed in Islamic teachings, as in the case of one who is not content to do wudu’ as it was prescribed, so he does more and uses water extravagantly; he is not content to wash his hands and feet three times, so he adds to that. This is a type of going to extremes in something that Allah has prescribed. The same may be said with regard to the adhan, the iqamah, fasting and so on.\nAdding to what is prescribed in Islamic teachings is described as going to extremes, excess and innovation. Falling short in prayer by doing less than is required and not doing it properly is called negligence and carelessness. The same applies to expenditure; we should not be extravagant or wasteful and we should not be stingy or miserly; rather we should be somewhere in between those extremes, for the best of matters are those that are moderate, as Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {Thus We have made of you an Ummah [nation, community] justly balanced} [Al-Baqarah 2:143].\nIslam teaches moderation in all things, and tells us that we should not go to extremes, be negligent or go to excess. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {O children of Adam, dress well every time you offer prayer [or perform tawaf]. Eat and drink, but do not exceed the bounds, for He does not love those who exceed the bounds} [Al-A‘raf 7:31]. In this verse, Allah, may He be glorified, instructs us to take dress well because our clothing covers the ‘awrah and because it is beautiful. Elsewhere He says: {But the garment of piety is best} [al-A ‘raf 7:26]. The garment of piety is belief in Allah, and piety means obeying Allah, following that which pleases Him and refraining from what He has prohibited. This is the greatest garment, the garment of piety.\nThen Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {Eat and drink, but do not exceed the bounds} [Al-A‘raf 7:31]. This is a command to eat and drink, because food and drink contain nourishment that will preserve health, well-being and physical strength, for not eating and drinking leads to death, and that is not permissible. Rather it is obligatory to eat and drink as much as will maintain health, so the individual should be moderate in that regard in order to preserve his health and maintain his well-being. He should not eat and drink to excess, which would lead to indigestion, sickness and various diseases, and he should not fall short in that, which would damage his health; rather he should be somewhere in between the two extremes. Hence Allah says: {but do not exceed the bounds}.\nThis extravagance in all things is one of the evils of this world. Hence the believer should be moderate in all his affairs, and the believing woman should be moderate in all her affairs. (End quote from Fatawa Ibn Baz, 4/10 9-112).\nPerhaps you will have noted from the above how Islamic teachings direct the Muslim to be moderate in doing wudu’. As Islam has enjoined that, it has also enjoined being moderate in all things, as it enjoins that when prescribing wudu’ five times every day and night, washing each body part three times.\nThus the beauty of Islamic teachings is clear to anyone who has eyes to see. Islam enjoins a kind of cleanliness that is unmatched, and there is nothing that is purer both outwardly and inwardly. Yet it instructs us to be economic when doing that and not go to extremes, which is based on the fundamental teachings and general guidelines of Islam, which enjoin that and urge people to adhere to that, and applies that to minor issues of those fundamental principles.\nWe ask Allah to help and guide you.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/178636/highlighting-the-beauty-of-islam-through-its-prohibition-on-extravagant-use-of-water
108125,I want to know the Islamic view on the topic of stem cells and cell banks. A cell bank is a place where a person’s stem cells are stored in return for a fee for a certain length of time — several years — so that they can be used in the future if needed.,"['Praise be to Allah.The Role of Stem Cells in Medical Treatments\nThe cells referred to in the question, stem cells, are extracted from the umbilical cord after birth. These cells that are taken from it play a role in rebuilding blood cells and strengthening the immune system of patients with blood diseases such as leukaemia (blood cancer) and anaemia. They may also be used to treat neurological diseases such as brain paralysis, Alzheimer’s and so on.\nThese cells are not attacked by the immune system, because they quickly develop into a neutral state. The umbilical cord looks somewhat like a rope; it connects the foetus in the uterus to the placenta. It contains two arteries and one vein. The arteries take blood carrying waste material from the foetus to the placenta, and the vein takes blood carrying oxygen and nutrients from the mother’s blood to the foetus.\xa0(End quote from Al-Mawsu`ah Al-`Arabiyyah Al-`Alamiyyah)\nSources of Stem Cells: Ethical Considerations in Islam\nThere are three sources for stem cells:\n\nStem cells taken from human embryos between the ages of 5 days and two weeks.\nStem cells taken from adults, which are collected in two ways:\n\n\nFrom bone marrow, i.e. from the bone itself, such as from the bones of the pelvis or chest. The problem with this method is that it is regarded as painful and requires a general anaesthetic; it also takes a long time, in addition to the fact that the amount of stem cells collected in this manner is very small.\n\n\nFrom blood. This requires a large amount of blood to be taken, then filtered, but in the end only a very small amount of stem cells is obtained.\n\n\nThe last and most important source of stem cells is the umbilical cord, which is a rich source of these cells; it may contain as many as 200 million stem cells!\n\nAre Stem Cell Banks Permissible in Islam?\nHence the idea developed of keeping these cells in “banks”. In Dubai there are public and private stem cell banks, and in Jeddah there is a private company that stores cells for those who want that, in return for a fee. These banks implement measures to guarantee that the cells will not be tampered with; the owner can also follow up and check on them just as he can check on the money in his bank account.\nSome doctors have stated that it is possible to preserve these cells for up to 25 years, and some doctors say that it is possible to store them for life.\nCan Stem Cells Be Donated or Sold?\nThese cells are useful not only for their owner who may be affected by diseases in which he can benefit from them; rather he can also donate them to others. Stem cells have indeed been used to treat cases of sickness and they have been a successful alternative to the risky procedure of transplanting bone marrow. From a medical point of view, stem cells are regarded as an alternative to organ donation, as it is possible to regenerate the patient’s damaged cells.\nFor their owner, they are a perfect match for his cells, and he is the only one who has a perfect match. Among members of the same family, the likelihood of a match varies between 25% to 40%. All of this, of course, applies so long as the mother does not have any communicable diseases such as hepatitis or AIDS. Hence it is essential to carry out tests on the mother’s blood before collecting the stem cells.\nBased on that, if an individual keeps them for himself, there should be no difference of opinion that it is permissible.\nIslamic Stance on Abortion and Stem Cell Use\nBecause of these benefits in the cells that are taken from the umbilical cord, some of those who do not fear Allah hastened to obtain umbilical cords by means of deliberate abortion. We are sorry to say that some of those whom people trusted with their lives did that.\nHence there was a clear statement by the Islamic Fiqh Council that it is prohibited to carry out deliberate abortions for the purpose of using the embryo’s organs – including stem cells, of course. There follows the text of the statement:\nIn the session of the Islamic Fiqh Council, held during its sixth conference in Jeddah, KSA, 17-23 Sha`ban 1410 AH (14-20 March 1990 CE), after studying the research and recommendations on this subject – which was entitled Using Foetuses as a Source for Organ Transplants – which was also one of the topics of the sixth Medical Fiqh conference held in Kuwait, 23-26 Rabi` Al-Awwal 1410 AH (23-26 October 1990 CE) – in cooperation between this Council and the Islamic Medical Sciences Organization, the following was determined:\n\nIt is not permissible to use foetuses as a source for organs that are needed for transplant into another individual except in some cases that are subject to conditions that must be met:\n\n\nIt is not permissible to deliberately induce abortion for the purpose of using the foetus in order to transplant organs into another individual. Rather abortion should be limited to that which is natural and spontaneous (i.e., miscarriage) and not deliberate, or abortion that is carried out for a legitimate shar`i reason. Surgery should not be resorted to in order to extract the foetus except where that is necessary in order to save the mother’s life.\nIf the foetus is viable (i.e., could survive), then medical treatment should focus on saving and preserving its life, and it should not be used for organ transplants. If the foetus is not viable, it is not permissible to use it except after its death, subject to conditions mentioned in statement no. 1 of the fourth conference of this Council, which discusses one human benefiting from the organs of another human, living or dead.\n\n\nIt is not permissible to use the process of organ transplant for commercial gain under any circumstances.\nIt is essential to delegate responsibility for supervision of organ transplants to a committee of specialist and trustworthy individuals. End quote.\n\nIs it permissible to use stem cells in Islam?\nIt seems – and Allah knows best – that it is permissible to make use of the cells found in the umbilical cord, especially when the cord is usually discarded.\nThe Fiqh Council of the Organization of the Islamic Conference issued a statement concerning this matter during its session that was held on 18 Jumada Al-Akhirah 1408 AH (6 February 1988 CE). The text of this statement follows:\nFirstly: it is permissible to transplant an organ from its place in a person’s body to elsewhere in his body, whilst making sure that the expected benefit from this procedure outweighs any potential harm, and on condition that this is done for the purpose of replacing a missing organ or reshaping it, or changing its function, or correcting a defect or removing a deformity that is causing psychological or physical pain. (End quote)\nShaykh Ibrahim Al-Fayyumi – Secretary General of the Islamic Research Council in Egypt – said:\nThe Council found that generating and growing tissues and cells in order to benefit from them in treating humans is done by using stem cells, and there is nothing wrong with that. This is based on what was mentioned by Professor Dr. Ibrahim Badran – a member of the Council and former Minister of Health.\nAnd he said:\nIslam does not prevent science that is beneficial to man. The Council is following with interest everything that is new in this important branch of science, and acknowledges that growing stem cells opens a new door to treatment that will reduce dependency on organ transplants from deceased persons or donors. It will give a greater opportunity to help patients whose illness is incurable, especially in cases of liver, kidney and heart disease.\nAnd he said:\nThere is no Shar`i reason to disallow setting up banks to store stem cells, so long as they are used for treating humans. (End quote)\nIs it permissible to donate sperm or eggs for producing zygotes?\nWe should point out that it is not permissible for anyone to donate sperm or eggs for the purpose of producing zygotes (fertilised eggs) which will then develop into the foetus with the aim of obtaining the stem cells from it. It is also not permissible to use cloning in order to obtain foetal stem cells. Rather permission is limited to obtaining stem cells from umbilical cords.\nA statement was issued by the Islamic Fiqh Council, no. 54 (6/5) on the topic of transplanting brain cells and nerve cells, the text of which is as follows:\nThe session of the Islamic Fiqh Council that was held during the sixth conference in Jeddah, KSA, 17-23 Sha`ban 1410 AH (14-20 March 1990 CE), after studying the research and recommendations on this topic that was one of the topics of the sixth Medical Fiqh conference held in Kuwait, 23-26 Rabi` Al-Awwal 1410 AH (23-26 October 1990 CE) – in cooperation between this Council and the Islamic Medical Sciences Organization, and in light of the conclusions reached by the conference referred to, and knowing that this does not mean transplanting the brain of one person to another person; rather the aim of this transplant is to treat a defect in specific cells in the brain that are not able to excrete sufficient chemical or hormone substances, so they are supplemented with similar cells from another source; or it is done to treat gaps in the nervous system that result from some injuries, the Council determined the following:\n\nFirstly: if the source of the tissue is the adrenal gland of the patient himself, and there is an advantage in that because it will not be rejected by his immune system as the cells are from the same body, there is nothing wrong with that from a Shar`i point of view.\nSecondly: if the source is an animal foetus, there is nothing wrong with this method if it can be successful and there are no Shar`i reservations. Doctors have stated that this method has been successful in different kinds of animals and it is hoped that it will be successful whilst taking the necessary medical precautions to avoid rejection by the immune system.\nThirdly: if the source of tissues is living cells from the brain of an early embryo – as old as ten to eleven weeks – the ruling varies according to the following:\n\n\nThe first method: taking the tissue directly from a human foetus in the mother’s uterus by opening the uterus surgically; this method results in death of the embryo as soon as the brain cells are taken, and it is haram unless it happens after spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) or an abortion that is permitted in Shari`ah in order to save the mother’s life, and after ascertaining that the foetus has died, whilst paying attention to the conditions which will be mentioned on the topic of using embryos in statement no. 59 (6/8) of this session.\nThe second method: this is the method which may be brought about in the near future, which involves growing brain cells in “farms” in order to make use of them. There is nothing wrong with this from a shar`i point of view, if the source of the cells is legitimate and they were obtained in a manner that is Islamically permissible. End quote.\n\nThe role of countries in opposing\xa0 aborting foetuses to obtain their organs and cells\nAll countries must oppose the abortion of foetuses in order to obtain their organs and cells, and it is not permissible to benefit from that which has been taken in unlawful ways to take part in setting up their banks. Trustworthy organisations should be in charge of this matter and these cells should be collected in ways that are Islamically acceptable, in order to treat those who need transplant of cells.\nIslamic Fiqh Council’s Statement on Stem Cell Research\nAfter writing the above, we came across a statement of the Islamic Fiqh Council attached to the Muslim World League on the topic of stem cells, which agrees with what we have stated above. We will post it here to summarise what is stated above and to give it precedence over other statements, because it is the opinion of virtuous scholars who are specialised in medicine and Shari`ah.\nThe statement of the Islamic Fiqh Council:\nThe Islamic Fiqh Council of the Muslim World League, in its seventeenth conference in Makkah Al-Mukarramah, 2003 CE, discussed the topic of transplanting stem cells on the basis of the sources of these cells, in accordance with the recommendations of the organisation in its sixth conference in 1989 CE, as mentioned above. In the third statement of the Islamic Fiqh Council, dated 17/12/2003 CE, it says the following:\nStem cells, which are the original cells from which the embryo is created, have the ability – by Allah’s leave – to develop into different types of cells in the human body. Scientists have recently been able to find out about these cells and to isolate them and grow them with the aim of using them for medical treatment and various scientific experiments. Hence they can be used to treat disease and they are expected to have a great impact in the future in treating many diseases and physical deformities, including some types of cancer, diabetes, kidney and liver failure, and so on.\nThese cells can be obtained from numerous sources, including the following:\n\nThe embryo at the blastula stage, where it forms a sphere of cells from which the various cells of the body will grow. Zygotes (fertilised eggs) produced in attempts at in-vitro fertilisation are regarded as the main source. It is also possible to deliberately fertilise an egg from a donor with sperm from a donor in order to obtain zygotes, and grow them until they reach the blastula stage, then extract the stem cells from them.\nAborted foetuses at any stage of pregnancy.\nThe placenta or umbilical cord\nChildren and adults\nCloning, which is done by taking a cell from an adult human, then extracting its nucleus and inserting it into an egg from which the nucleus has been removed, with the aim of reaching the blastula stage, then obtaining stem cells from it.\n\nAfter listening to the research presented on this topic and the opinions of members, experts and specialists, and finding out about this type of cells and their sources, and the ways in which they may be used, the Council took the following decision:\n\nFirstly: it is permissible to obtain stem cells and grow them, and use them for medical treatment or permissible scientific research, if the sources are permissible. That includes, for example, the following sources:\n\n\nAdults if they have given permission and that will not cause any harm.\nChildren, if their guardians have given permission, if it is done for a legitimate purpose and without harming them.\nPlacentas and umbilical cords, with the permission of the parents.\nSpontaneously aborted foetuses (i.e., miscarriage) or foetuses from abortions that were carried out for medical reasons permitted by Shari`ah, with the permission of the parents.\n\nWe should also be reminded of the seventh resolution of the twelfth session, about cases in which it is permissible to abort a pregnancy.\n\nSpare fertilised eggs (zygotes) from attempts at in-vitro fertilisation, if there are any and they have been donated by the parents; it should be noted that it is not permissible to use them for an illegitimate pregnancy.\n\n\nSecondly: it is not permissible to obtain stem cells and use them if their source is prohibited, such as the following, for example:\n\n\nFoetuses that have been aborted deliberately without any medical reason that would make that permissible according to Shari`ah.\nZygotes that result from fertilisation of donor eggs with donor sperm.\nCloning.

302845,Why has Allah appointed certain angels to do tasks when he (s.w.t) can do it himself? Asking out of curiosity,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nOne of the basic principles of faith is belief in the noble angels, and belief that Allah, may He be exalted, has appointed each angel to do a certain task. That includes managing some matters of this universe. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And those who arrange [each] matter}\xa0[Az-Nazi`at 79:5].\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nRegarding the words {And those who arrange [each] matter}, `Ali, Mujahid, `Ata’, Abu Salih, al-Hasan, Qatadah, ar-Rabi` ibn Anas and as-Suddi said: This refers to the angels. Al-Hasan added: They arrange [each] matter from the heaven to the earth; that is, on the command of their Lord, may He be glorified and exalted. There is no difference of scholarly opinion regarding that. (End quote from Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 8/313).\nShaykh ‘Abd ar-Rahman as-Sa‘di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n{And those who arrange [each] matter} are the angels, whom Allah has appointed to arrange many matters in the upper and lower realms, such as rain, plants, trees, winds, seas, foetuses, animals, paradise, hell and so on. (End quote from Tafsir as-Sa‘di, p. 908).\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nEvery movement in the heavens and on earth, including the movement of planets, stars, the sun, the moon, winds, clouds, plants and animals, is initiated by the angels who are appointed in charge of the heavens and the earth, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {And those who arrange [each] matter} [az-Nazi`at 79:5] and {And the [angels] apportioning [each] matter} [adh-Dhariyat 51:4]. These verses refer to the angels, according to those who believe and follow the messengers (peace be upon them)…\nThe Qur’an and Sunnah indicate that there are different types of angels, and that they are appointed in charge of different types of created things. Allah, may He be glorified, has appointed angels in charge of the mountains, and has appointed angels in charge of the clouds and rain. He has appointed angels in charge of the wombs, who manage the affairs of the fertilised egg until its creation is completed, then He appoints angels to protect the person, and angels to record his deeds and write them down. He has appointed angels in charge of death, and has appointed angels to question the deceased in the grave. He has appointed angels in charge of heavenly bodies, who control their movements, And He has appointed angels in charge of the sun and moon. He has appointed angels in charge of hell to stoke its flames and punish its occupants, and He has appointed angels in charge of what happens in it. He has appointed angels in charge of paradise and what happens in it, who take care of its plants and rivers.The angels are the greatest of the troops of Allah, may He be exalted. (End quote from Ighathat al-Lahfan, 2/842)\nSecondly:\nEven though Allah, may He be exalted, has appointed the angels to manage some matters of His dominion, their management thereof is by His leave and His command, and they only do what they are commanded to do.\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe word malak (angel) conveys the sense of a messenger who is carrying out the command of someone else. So the angels have no say in anything; rather the command belongs to Allah, the One, the Compeller, alone, and they carry out His command.\n{They do not speak until He has spoken, and they act by His command.\nHe knows what is [presently] before them and what will be after them, and they cannot intercede except on behalf of one whom He approves. And they are filled with reverent awe of Him}\xa0[Al-Anbiya’ 21:27-28]\n{They fear their Lord above them, and they do what they are commanded}\xa0[An-Nahl 16:50]\n{they do not disobey Allah in what He commands them but do what they are commanded}\xa0[At-Tahrim 66:6].\nThey only descend by His command, and they do not do anything except after He has given permission. They are honoured slaves of His. Some of them are the [angels] lined up in rows and some of them are those who glorify Him. There is no one among them but he has an assigned place, beyond which he does not go, and he does the task that he was commanded to do, without falling short or overstepping the mark. (End quote from Ighathat al-Lahfan, 2/843).\nThirdly:\nOne of the things that are definitively proven in Islam is that Allah, may He be exalted, does not do anything except on the basis of ultimate wisdom, whether He has informed us of that or has kept knowledge of it to Himself, may He be glorified and exalted.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about the wisdom behind the creation of the jinn and humankind, and he (may Allah have mercy on him) replied:\nBefore I speak about this matter, I would like to point out a general principle regarding what Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, creates and what He prescribes.\nThis principle is taken from the verses (interpretation of the meaning)\n{and He is the Knowing, the Wise} [at-Tahrim 66:2] and {Indeed, Allah is ever Knowing and Wise} [an-Nisa’ 4:11], and many other verses which affirm that Allah is wise in what He creates and in what He prescribes – that is, in His universal decree and His religious decree. There is nothing that Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, creates but there is wisdom behind it, whether that is when bringing it into existence or when taking it out of existence.\nAnd there is nothing that Allah, may He be exalted, prescribes except there is wisdom behind it, whether that is making something obligatory or prohibited or permissible.\nBut this wisdom on which His universal decree and religious decree are based may be known to us or it may be unknown, or it may be known to some people and not others, commensurate with the level of knowledge and understanding that Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, grants them. (End quote from Majmu` Fatawa ash-Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin, 1/87).\nFourthly:\nThe perfect nature of the wisdom of Allah, may He be exalted, is something that is well established and well known to every Muslim, and submitting to it is one of the fundamentals of faith.\nImam ash-Shafa`i (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Allah enjoined His Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and all other creatures to worship Him in whatever way He willed, as was stated by His Prophet. No one has the right to question why or how, or add his own view to what was narrated from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). (End quote from al-Umm, 10/16).\nKnowing that motivates the Muslim to focus on purifying himself and not let himself be distracted by giving his view on issues that do not bring any benefit; rather they lead to going to extremes in doubts and expose him to intrusive thoughts (waswasah).\nIbn Abi’l-‘Izz al-Hanafi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nYou should understand that the basis of servitude and belief in Allah and His Books and His Messengers is submission and not asking about the details of the wisdom behind the commands, prohibitions and other divine laws.\nHence Allah, may He be glorified, did not tell us that any nation that believed in its prophet and believed in the message he brought to them ever asked him about the details of the wisdom behind what he enjoined them to do and forbade them to do, and what he conveyed to them from their Lord. If they had done that, they would not have been believers in their prophet; rather they accepted the teachings, submitted and surrendered.\nWhatever they learned of the wisdom behind rulings is what they learned, and whatever was hidden from them, their submission and surrender did not depend on knowing that, and the nation never thought that finding out about that wisdom was any of their concern, for they thought too highly of their messenger to ask him about that.\nHence the early generations of this ummah – which is the most perfect of nations in terms of mature thinking, knowledge and understanding – did not ask their Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): Why did Allah enjoin such and such? Why did He forbid such and such? Why did He decree such and such? That was because they knew that asking such questions is contrary to faith and submission, and they could not remain steadfast in their commitment to Islam unless they surrendered…\nAllah, may He be glorified and exalted, is not to be questioned about what He does, because of the perfect nature of His wisdom, mercy and justice, not merely because of His might and power. (End quote from Sharh at-Tahhawiyyah, p. 261-262)\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {And your Lord creates what He wills and chooses; not for them was the choice. Exalted is Allah and high above what they associate with Him} [al-Qasas 28:68].\nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 186418.\nFifthly:\nWhen the Muslim reflects on the actions of the angels, some aspects of the wisdom of Allah, may He be exalted, will become apparent to him.\nAllah’s creation of the angels and their deeds confirms the perfection of His lordship and His divinity. So when the Muslim learns about the immense size of these angels and their large numbers, and the tasks to which they are appointed, yet despite that not one of them disobeys Allah’s command in the slightest – rather they race to obey Him, may He be glorified and exalted – that is indicative of the perfect lordship and divinity of Allah, may He be exalted.\nIf the great number of troops and workers of a king in this world is indicative of his perfect sovereignty and control, and is indicative of the high level of obedience that his subjects show him, then in the case of Allah, may He be exalted, this meaning is demonstrated more clearly by His creation of the noble angels. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And they say, “The Most Merciful has taken a son.” Exalted is He! Rather, they are [but] honored servants.\nThey do not speak until He has spoken, and they act by His command.\nHe knows what is [presently] before them and what will be after them, and they cannot intercede except on behalf of one whom He approves. And they are filled with reverent awe of Him.\nAnd whoever of them should say, “Indeed, I am a god besides Him” – that one We would requite with Hell. Thus do We requite the wrongdoers}\xa0[Al-Anbiya’ 21:26-29].\nMoreover, for the one who studies the texts of the revelation concerning the existence of the angels and the tasks to which they are appointed, that will instil in him perfect fear of Allah, may He be exalted, and at the same time will instil in him perfect love and hope.\nIf he studies the texts of the revelation that speak of the angels of punishment and those who write down people’s deeds, that will increase him in fear of Allah. In contrast, if he studies the texts of the revelation that speak of the angels of mercy and the guardian angels, that will increase him in love for his Lord and hope of His forgiveness. All of this leads to attaining the level of faith that is enjoined upon people.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Only those believe in Our verses who, when they are reminded by them, fall down in prostration and exalt [Allah] with praise of their Lord, and they are not arrogant.\nThey arise from [their] beds; they supplicate their Lord in fear and aspiration, and from what We have provided them, they spend}\xa0[As-Sajdah 32:15-16].\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nBelief in the angels leads to great outcomes, including the following:\n\nKnowledge of Allah’s greatness, power, might and authority, for the greatness of the created being is connected to the greatness of the Creator.\nGratitude to Allah, may He be exalted, for His care towards the children of Adam, as He has appointed some of these angels to protect them, record their deeds and do other things that are in their interests… (End quote from Majmu` al-Fatawa, 6/89).\n\nAnd he (may Allah have mercy on him) said regarding the wisdom behind the creation of the noble scribes (the recording angels), even though Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, knows all things and nothing that we do in secret or in public is hidden from Him:\nThe wisdom behind that is that it highlights the fact that Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has created all things in a system, according to estimates and calculations, and He has perfected it to the extent that He has appointed noble scribes to record the words and deeds of the children of Adam, who write down everything that they do, even though Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, knows what they will do before they do it.\nBut all of that serves to highlight how perfect is the care of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, for man, and it highlights the fact that this universe is put together in the best order and is perfectly designed.

14506,"I live in a non-Muslim country and find some difficulty when the time of prayer comes while I am outside home as there are not always nearby mosques everywhere you go. A lot of sisters (including myself) have no solution but to pray in the fitting rooms of the shops, or sometimes in the nursing rooms where mums change the nappies for their babies. The problem is that sometimes these nursing rooms have a special section (a corner in the room) where there is a toilet for children. Is it OK to pray there away from the toilet, or is it still considered a “Najis” place? Also can a Muslim woman pray in an open park or car parking? I do not feel shy about my religion and I do not care about people seeing me, but I sometimes feel shy when non-Muslims stand and stare as if you are doing a show! I am also worried that it could be haram for a Muslim woman to pray in front of men. We try to avoid these situations as much as we can, but sometimes we cannot. What should a sister do in these situations?","['Praise be to Allah.Can you pray in the bathroom?\nIt was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that it is prohibited to pray in certain places, including bathrooms. It is not permissible to pray in them.\nIt was narrated in an authentic report from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that he said: “All the earth is a mosque except for graveyards and bathrooms.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, As-Salah, 291; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Sunan At-Tirmidhi, 262)\nIs Praying in a Room with a Toilet Permissible?\n“Bathroom” refers to every place that is used for the purpose of relieving oneself; it is not permissible to pray in any such place. This room on the edge of which there is a toilet is not considered to be a bathroom so long as there is a barrier between it and the bathroom, with a wall and door etc.\nIn this case, prayer in that room is valid, because the prohibition on praying in bathrooms is because they are usually impure, and this room is not like that.\nWhat indicates that prayer in this place and elsewhere is valid is the Hadith in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The earth has been made a place of prayer and a means of purification for me, so wherever a man is when the time for prayer comes, let him pray.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, At-Tayammum, 323)\nGuidelines for Women Praying in Public Spaces\nSo prayer in that place is valid, and it is also valid in parks and parking lots, on condition that the place in which one prays is pure.\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked, if there is a bathroom in front of a person in the direction of the Qiblah, is it O.K. to pray facing it?\nHe said:\nThe prayer is valid and there is nothing wrong with that, rather what is forbidden is to pray inside the bathroom.\xa0(End quote from Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn Baz, vol. 2, p. 196)\nOne thing to which attention must be paid is that a woman should uncover her face when praying, especially when she is among other women or her Mahrams. But if she is praying in a place where men can see her, then she should cover her face whilst praying.\nThe Importance of Praying on Time\nSecondly: you will be rewarded, in sha Allah, for your keenness to do the prayers on time. Undoubtedly the Muslim is obliged to do the prayers on time. And you have to make yourself feel that you are obeying Allah when you are praying.\nYour adherence to the truth and your establishing prayer and not feeling shy to worship openly may be the means of guiding some of the non-Muslims who see you to Islam, in which case you will have a reward equal to theirs in sha Allah.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/14506/is-praying-in-a-room-with-a-toilet-permissible%C2%A0
