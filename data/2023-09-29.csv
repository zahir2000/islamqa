113584,"I am a student in a university in France and I live with my family. I do not want to continue my studies, yet I signed up in university to study. I receive a monthly grant to spend on my study, but I did not go to university since the educational year started except few times. I intended to leave study totally and attend only the exams, as I fear they stop giving me the grant. What is the ruling on taking this grant, knowing that I spend most of it on my family and friends?","['Praise be to Allah.If the matter is as you mention, that you received this grant legally, there is nothing wrong with you accepting it, even if you have decided to give up your study completely, so long as you have not actually given it up yet.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/113584/she-received-a-grant-to-spend-on-her-study-but-she-has-decided-to-give-up-her-study
112139,I am not able to fast on Thursdays for certain reasons. Is it sufficient for me to fast on Monday every week or is it essential to fast both of them?,"['Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with fasting on one of the two days mentioned and not the other. Fasting on these two days is Sunnah and is not obligatory, so if someone fasts on both of them or one of them, he is doing a great good deed. It is not obligatory to fast on both of them; rather that is recommended (mustahabb) because of the sahih hadiths concerning that which were narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). And Allah is the source of strength.
