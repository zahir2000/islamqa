342396,"Some people say [in Arabic] “May the angels of the Most Gracious say Bismillah over you” in response to someone saying “Bismillah ‘alayk” [lit. “In the name of Allah over you”, meant as a prayer for Allah’s protection]. Can we attribute this action [saying Bismillah] to the angels? What is the ruling on that? What should a person do who has the habit of saying this to people? Is it a sin?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe angels\nThe angels are honoured slaves of Allah who have the characteristics that Allah has mentioned in His book (interpretation of the meaning):\n{[All] praise is [due] to Allah, Creator of the heavens and the earth, [who] made the angels messengers having wings, two or three or four. He increases in creation what He wills. Indeed, Allah is over all things competent}\xa0[Fatir 35:1]\n{The heavens almost break from above them, and the angels exalt [ Allah ] with praise of their Lord and ask forgiveness for those on earth. Unquestionably, it is Allah who is the Forgiving, the Merciful}\xa0[ash-Shura 42:5].\nSecondly:\nWas it narrated that the angels say Bismillah over anyone?\nThere is no report in the Islamic texts to suggest that the angels say Bismillah over anyone; rather it was narrated that they pray for forgiveness for the believer . So if someone says: “May the angels pray for forgiveness for you,” and the like, that is more appropriate and is better.\nBut we say: there is nothing wrong with such phrases that are commonly used by people, because saying Bismillah is no more than a kind of dhikr (remembrance of Allah), and the intended meaning is: May Allah protect you; or it is a supplication asking Allah to protect and take care of the other person. There is nothing wrong with any of that. The angels glorify and remember Allah, and among the angels are guardians and protectors who protect people by Allah’s command and decree, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{For each one are successive [angels] before and behind him who protect him by the decree of Allah. Indeed, Allah will not change the condition of a people until they change what is in themselves. And when Allah intends for a people ill, there is no repelling it. And there is not for them besides Him any patron}\xa0[Ar-Ra‘d 13:11].\nIn other words, Allah has angels who come in succession to protect His slave from all directions, coming one after another without any delay. Each of them comes straight after the other, taking turns to protect him by night and by day from all harm that could touch him or anything bad that could happen to him. This protection is by the command of Allah, meaning because Allah has commanded them to do that. And when the decree of Allah [for some harm to befall him] comes to pass, the angels forsake him.""(At-Tafsir al-Wasit\xa0 5/416).\nMoreover, if someone were to say: “May the angels of the Most Gracious say Bismillah over you,” he is not saying that this is what the angels do; rather it is a supplication asking that the angels might say Bismillah over him, and is a prayer for protection for him, asking that the blessing of Allah’s name be bestowed upon him. This is clearly a good intention, and there is nothing wrong with it, in sha Allah.\nConclusion:\nThere does not seem to be anything wrong with this phrase, and there is nothing to dictate that one should be strict about it or tell off anyone who says it.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/342396/what-is-the-ruling-on-saying-may-the-angels-of-the-most-gracious-say-bismillah-over-you
308096,"I took out a loan without interest, with repayment to be made by instalments. One of the conditions of this loan is that I have to provide a fake invoice for an electrical household appliance intended for use at home, so that that invoice may be included in the loan application file. Please note that you can ask for this invoice from any store selling household electrical goods, and it is a fake invoice, with no signature, fingerprint or anything. It only includes your name, and there is no obligation to buy these items; all it does is show the total amount required for the items one intends to buy, which is the same amount that I am going to borrow. The shop owner knows that I am not going to buy these items, and the lender does not verify whether the loan will be used to buy them. Now, after taking out the loan, I do not want to use it to buy these items; rather I want to use it for other things. What is the ruling on that? If it is not permissible, then what is the solution?","['Praise be to Allah.If the lender stipulates that you should buy appliances with this loan, or he will only lend to one who needs to buy these appliances, then it is not permissible to use tricks to get this invoice, and it is not permissible to use the loan for anything except what is stipulated.\nThe basis for that is the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “The Muslims are bound by their conditions.” Narrated by Abu Dawud (3594); classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud.\nAl-Bayhaqi (14826) narrated from ‘Abd ar-Rahman ibn Ghanm that ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Rights are defined by stipulated conditions. Classed as sahih by al-Albani in al-Irwa’ (6/303).\nAl-Bukhari said in his Sahih: Ibn ‘Awn narrated from Ibn Sirin: A man said to the man whom he hired, along with his mount: Take your mount to the stable, and if I do not set out with you on such and such a day, I will give you one hundred dirhams. Then he did not set out with him. Shurayh said: Whoever stipulates a condition for himself willingly, without being compelled to do that, is bound by it.\nEnd quote from Sahih al-Bukhari, the Book of Conditions (Kitab ash-Shurut), Chapter: what is permitted of stipulated conditions.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: To conclude, the basic principle is that stipulating conditions is something that is permissible and valid, whether that has to do with marriage, buying and selling, renting and hiring, collateral, or endowments (waqfs). The ruling on stipulated conditions in contracts is that if the conditions are valid and permissible, they must be fulfilled, in the case of marriage and other matters, because of the general meaning of the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {O you who have believed, fulfill [all] contracts} [al-Ma’idah 5:1]. Fulfilling contracts includes fulfilling all the conditions and clauses thereof, because all of that is part of the contract.""(Ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘\xa0 12/164).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/308096/if-one-of-the-conditions-of-the-loan-is-that-one-should-produce-an-invoice-for-purchase-of-household-appliances-is-it-permissible-to-produce-a-fake-invoice
