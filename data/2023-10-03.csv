417534,"If a brother sees his sisters doing something wrong, and he keeps quiet because he is afraid, then he tells his father after some time, and there are consequences of his having kept quiet for a while, is he sinning? Is he responsible for that?","['Praise be to Allah.The one whose sees something wrong and is able to act or speak against it must do so, unless he fears that doing so will lead to a greater evil.\nMuslim (49) narrated that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever among you sees an evil action, let him change it with his hand (by taking action); if he cannot, then with his tongue (by speaking out); and if he cannot, then with his heart (by hating it and feeling it is wrong), and that is the weakest of faith.”\nIbn al-Qayyim said:\nDenouncing evil is of four levels:\n1. When it is removed and replaced with its opposite [its opposite is what is right and good].\n2. When it is reduced, even if it is not completely removed.\n3. When it is replaced with something that is equally bad.\n4. When it is replaced with something that is worse than it.\nThe first two levels are acceptable, the third is subject to ijtihad, and the fourth is haram.""(I‘lam al-Muwaqqi‘in\xa03/12-13).\nYou should understand that it is very important for the brother to object to what his sisters are doing, because they are his honour and he is enjoined to protect them. If he fears that denouncing their wrong actions will lead to negative consequences, he should tell his father or mother.\nAs to whether he is sinning by not denouncing their actions, if he fails to denounce their wrong actions or tell his parents when he is not expecting a greater evil to result from that, then he is sinning. If he fears a greater evil may result from denouncing their actions on telling his father, and he puts a stop to the evil action and tries to prevent any repeat of it, then he is excused, in sha Allah.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/417534/if-a-brother-sees-his-sisters-doing-something-wrong-and-keeps-quiet-then-there-are-consequences-is-he-sinning
13966,"If a woman’s husband dies, she remains in ‘iddah (a waiting period) whilst mourning. What are the things that a woman should not do during the mourning period?","['Praise be to Allah.Forbidden practices for a mourning woman :\xa0\n\nGo out of the house : she is only allowed to do so for a necessity, such as if she is sick and needs to go to the hospital, in which case she should go during the day; or in the case of emergencies such as if her house is about to fall down and she fears that it may collapse on top of her; or in the case of fire; and so on.\xa0\n\nThe scholars said: “She may go out during the day for necessary purposes, but at night she should not go out unless it is essential.”\xa0\n\nWear perfume: the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade the  mourning woman from wearing perfume except when she purifies herself following her period, in which case she may apply a little Azfar (a kind of perfume) after her period ends, to remove the traces of menstruation odour\nWear beautiful clothes : the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade the woman from wearing clothes that are considered to be adornments while mourning. Rather she should wear ordinary clothes such as the kind that she usually wears inside her house, without making herself look beautiful\nApply kohl: the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade that. If she needs to use it, she should use the kind of kohl whose colour is not obvious, applying it at night and removing it during the day\xa0\nWear jewellery : if a woman is forbidden from wearing beautiful clothes while mourning, it is more appropriate that jewellery should not be allowed.\xa0\n\nPermissible practices for a mourning woman:\nIt is permissible for a widow in mourning to:\n\nSpeak to men\xa0\nSpeak on the telephone\nAllow people to enter the house who are permitted to do so according to Shari`ah\nGo onto the roof of her house during the night and during the day.\xa0\n\nPractices women are not compelled to do during mourning:\nThere are some practices that women commonly do while mourning which they are not compelled to do, such as:\n\nPerform ghusl every week as some of the common folk think\nUndo their hair every week\nA widow in mourning does not have to – indeed it is not prescribed for her to – go out when her `iddah (waiting period) ends and give charity to the first person she meets. This is an act of bid`ah (religious innovation).\xa0\n\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13966/prohibited-practices-for-a-mourning-woman
114800,"I had some secretion that was streaked with blood, and I purified myself from it, but some of it got onto my underwear, and I forgot to change this underwear, and I prayed. What is the ruling on this prayer, is it valid or invalid?","['Praise be to Allah.Your prayer is valid, and you do not have to do anything, because whoever prays with some impurity [on him or his clothing] that he was not aware of, or he was aware of it then he forgot it, his prayer is valid according to the more correct scholarly view. al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) attributed this view to the majority of scholars and favoured this view. ""(Al-Majmu‘\xa0 1/163).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If a person forgets that impurity got onto him, and he did not remember until after he said the salaam at the end of the prayer, then he must repeat the prayer according to the author’s view, because he broke one of the conditions of the prayer, which is avoiding impurity, so it is as if he prayed without wudu’, forgetting that he had broken his wudu’.\nThe same applies if he forgets to wash off the impurity.\nThe more correct view concerning all these issues is that he does not have to repeat the prayer, whether he forgot [about the impurity] or he forgot to wash it off, or he was unaware that it had got onto him, or he was unaware that it was an impurity, or he was unaware of the ruling, or he was unaware of it before the prayer or after the prayer.\nThe evidence for that is the important general principle which Allah set out for His slaves, which is mentioned in the verse (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Allah does not place on any soul a burden greater than it can bear. For it is what it has earned, and against it is what it has committed. Our Lord, do not hold us accountable if we forget or fall into error}\xa0[Al-Baqarah 2:286].\nThis man who did this haram action was unaware of the ruling or forgot, and Allah has spared him accountability for it, so nothing further is required of him.\nThere is evidence which specifically addresses this issue, which is that when the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) prayed wearing shoes on which there was something filthy, and Jibril informed him of that, he did not start the prayer again from the beginning. If this did not render the first part of the prayer invalid, then it should not render the remainder of the prayer invalid.""(Ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘\xa0 2/232).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/114800/she-forgot-to-remove-the-impurities-from-her-clothes-and-prayed-wearing-them
27093,What are the factors which cause a widening gap between Muslim and christian communities?.,"['Praise be to Allah.Basic Tenets of Islamic Belief\xa0\xa0\nThere are many great factors that widen the gaps between Muslims and Christians. The differences in belief between us and them do not let us get close unless they give up their disbelief and misguidance, and join the monotheists who believe in One Lord and God, and bear witness that the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is His Messenger, and believe that `Isa (Jesus – peace be upon him) was a human being.\nBasic Tenets of Christian Belief\nThese are the most significant deviations in their religion, which widen the gap between us Muslims and them:\xa0\n\nThe Messiah (peace be upon him) is a god alongside God and that he is the second person of the holy trinity .\nThe Messiah is the son of God .\nDivinity may be incarnated in humanity.\nGod is formed of three\xa0 coequal consubstantial divine persons, which is known as the doctrine of the trinity.\nThe Messiah (peace be upon him) was crucified by the Jews on the command of Pontius Pilate, and that he died on the cross.\nThe Messiah died on the cross as a ransom for mankind and as expiation for original sin .\nThe Christian attitude towards the Jews who disbelieved in Jesus (peace be upon him) and claimed that they crucified him and killed him, and they accused his mother Mary (Maryam - peace be upon her) of fornication – of which she was innocent – yet despite all that their attitude towards them today is one of support and loyalty, and their attitude towards the Muslims who venerate Jesus (peace be upon him) and his mother is one of enmity and disavowal.\nTheir distortion of the Book of God, the Gospel (Injil), whether they distorted the words by changing them or by adding words, or they distorted the meaning, and in doing that they attribute things to God that cannot be attributed to Him.\nThe doctrine of redemption, which is their belief that God sent His only son to redeem mankind from a sin committed by the father of mankind (Adam – peace be upon him), but God was unable to forgive his sin, so He sent His only son who had no sin, to sacrifice himself in order to do away with sin. This is an attribution of imperfection to the Lord of the Worlds and a denial of the fact that Adam (peace be upon him) repented and Allah saved the Messiah (peace be upon him) from death.\nTheir disbelief in the Prophethood of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), even though he is mentioned in the Old and New Testaments.\nTheir belief in the soundness of the distorted Torah that they have in front of them today, which contains insults against God, describing Him as having shortcomings, and insults against the Prophets and Messengers, saying things that one can hardly dare utter, but we mention them in order to highlight the abhorrent nature of the disbelief that they follow. They describe God as weeping with regret for the Flood which drowned the people of Noah, until His eyes became sore, and the angels came to visit Him – exalted be He far above that.\n\nThey describe Lot (peace be upon him) as committing incest with his two daughters, and Noah (peace be upon him) as drinking wine until he became drunk and his `awrah (private parts) was exposed. There are even more foolish stories than that.\xa0\nSee Hidayat al-Hayara fi Ajwibat al-Yahud wa’l-Nasara by Ibn al-Qayyim; Naqd al-Nasraniyyah by Dr. Muhammad ibn ‘Abd-Allah al-Sahim\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/27093/differences-between-christianity-and-islam
