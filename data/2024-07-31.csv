353034,"My daughter is asking: When Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, manifested Himself to the mountain, He made it crumble. Why does nothing happen to the universe when Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, descends in a manner that is befitting to His majesty every night?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nWe ask Allah to help us, you and all the Muslims to raise children in a manner that Allah loves and is pleased with, and to enable us to follow the path of the people of faith and righteousness, and to make all our offspring righteous.\nSecondly:\nThe attributes of Allah do not resemble the attributes of created beings.\nYou must explain to your daughter that there is nothing like unto Allah, may He be glorified, and nothing resembles Him. There is nothing like unto Him and He is the All-Hearing, All-Seeing. You should tell her that the believer believes in the attributes of Allah, may He be glorified, but they cannot be likened to the attributes of created beings.\nYou should tell her that Allah, may He be exalted, is able to do things that humans are not able to do. Allah, may He be exalted, hears everything and sees everything, and He does whatever He wills, because He is the Almighty Creator.\nAs Allah, may He be exalted, has told us about His descending, the believer must believe that He descends, but this descending is not like the descending of people; rather His descending happens in a manner that we do not know, and humans cannot grasp it.\nThirdly:\nThe difference between manifesting and descending\nYou should explain to her that there is a difference between manifesting and descending.\nManifesting means appearing; what is meant is appearing to people’s eyes.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{… he said: O my Lord, show Yourself to me, so that I may look upon You. Allah said: You cannot see Me. But look at the mountain; if it remains firm in its place, then you will see Me. But when his Lord appeared to the mountain, He caused it to crumble, and Musa fell down unconscious}\n[al-A‘raf 7:143].\nAr-Rabi‘ ibn Anas said: When his Lord appeared to the mountain, He caused it to crumble and Musa fell down unconscious. That is because, when the concealment was lifted and the mountain saw the divine light, it crumbled. Some of the scholars said that what is meant is that He caused it to break up into small pieces.\nMujahid said regarding the phrase {But look at the mountain; if it remains firm in its place, then you will see Me}: [What is meant is:] it is bigger than you and is a stronger creation. But when his Lord manifested Himself to the mountain, Musa look at the mountain and saw that it was not able to withstand that, and it collapsed completely and broke into small pieces, so he fell down unconscious.\n‘Ikrimah said: {He caused it to crumble} means: Allah looked at the mountain, and it was flattened and turned to dust.\nEnd quote from Tafsir Ibn Kathir (3/47). See also: Tafsir at-Tabari (13/97 ff).\nSee also: Sifat Allah ‘azza wa jalla al-Waridah fi’l-Kitab wa’s-Sunnah by ‘Alawi as-Saqqaf (92).\nWith regard to descending, we believe that Allah, may He be exalted, descends every night to the lowest heaven, during the last third of the night, as is mentioned in mutawatir hadiths. This descending happens in a manner that is befitting to His majesty, and we cannot discuss how it is or try to depict it. It is not like the descending of created beings when they move from one place to another, so that there is something above them. Rather He descends to the lowest heaven when He is still above His Throne and above all of His creation, so there is nothing above Him.\nThis is different from the descending of created beings, so no one can imagine it or try to see it in his mind’s eye, for Allah Essence cannot be imagined or comprehended, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): {but they do not encompass Him with their knowledge} [Ta-Ha 20:110].\nSee also the answers to questions no. 12290 and 20081 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/353034/manifestation-and-descent-are-divine-attributes
129666,"If I lose my Wudu during the prayer, should I complete the prayer? Should I complete it from where I left off or start the prayer from the beginning all over again? When should one say the Taslim - is it after the imam’s first Taslim or his second?","['Praise be to Allah.What to do if wudu breaks during prayer\nThe one who loses his Wudu during the prayer, by passing wind or otherwise , should go and do Wudu, then come back and start the prayer from the beginning all over again, according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions. This is the view of the Malikis, Shafa`is and Hanbalis, unlike the Hanafis and the older view of the Shafa`is.\xa0\nThis applies to the one who cannot help breaking his Wudu. As for the one who breaks his Wudu deliberately, his prayer becomes invalid according to scholarly consensus.\xa0\nThe evidence quoted by the majority concerning this issue is analogy. They say, Because breaking wind and the like makes Wudu invalid, so it also makes the prayer invalid, as is also the case when one breaks Wudu deliberately.\xa0\nThe Hanafis quoted as evidence the Hadith of `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever regurgitates, has a nosebleed, vomits, or emits Madhi (prostatic fluid) should stop praying, do Wudu, then resume his prayer, and whilst he is in that situation he should not speak”, but this is an inauthentic Hadith. It was narrated by Ibn Majah, 1221. Al-Busayri said in Az-Zawa’id: Its chain of narrators includes Isma`il ibn `Ayyash, who narrated from the Hijazis, but his narration from them is inauthentic.\xa0\nAl-Hafidh ibn Hajar said in At-Talkhis Al-Habir, 1/495: “More than one of the scholars criticized the report of Isma`il ibn `Ayyash from Ibn Jurayj and the report of Isma`il from the Hijazis as inauthentic. The scholars of Hadith among the companions of Ibn Jurayj differed with Ibn Hajar and they narrated it from Ibn Jurayj, from his father, from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in a Mursal report.” (See: At-Tahqiq fi Ahadith Al-Khilaf by Ibn Al-Jawzi, 1/83; Tanqih At-Tahqiq by Ibn `Abd Al-Hadi, 1/284)\xa0\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “We have stated that our view is the correct, new one, that it is not permissible to resume (from where one left off); rather one has to start all over again. This is the view of the Companions Al-Miswar ibn Makhramah (may Allah be pleased with him). It was also the view of Malik and others. This is the correct view from the Madhhab of Ahmad.\xa0\nAbu Hanifah, Ibn Abu Layla and Al-Awza`i said: “He may continue his prayer from where he left off. This was narrated by Ibn As-Sabbagh and others from `Umar ibn Al-Khattab, `Ali and Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with them). It was also narrated by Al-Bayhaqi from `Ali, Salman Al-Farisi, Ibn `Abbas, Ibn `Umar, Ibn Al-Musayyab, Abu Salamah ibn `Abd Ar-Rahman, `Ata’, Tawus, Abu Idrees Al-Khawlani, Sulayman ibn Yasar and others (may Allah be pleased with them). The author mentioned in brief the evidence for both views, but the Hadith is inauthentic. The Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) differed concerning this issue, so the matter may be resolved on the basis of analogy. And Allah knows best.” (Al-Majmu`, 4/6) (See also Al-Mughni, 1/421)\nAsh-Shafa`i (may Allah have mercy on him) interpreted the reports about some of the Companions\xa0 exiting the prayer because of nosebleed, then going to do Wudu, then resuming the prayer from where they left off as referring to washing away the blood, not Wudu in the sense of ablution for prayer.\xa0\nAnd he (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Rather what is meant by Wudu here, in our opinion, is washing off blood and whatever else had gotten onto the body, not Wudu for prayer. It was narrated from Ibn Mas`ud that he washed his hands after eating, then he wiped his face with his wet hands and said: This is the Wudu of one who has not broken his Wudu. This (usage of the word Wudu) is well known among the Arabs, who use the word to refer to washing some part of the body, not all the parts that should be washed in the case of Wudu for prayer.” (As-Sunan Al-Kubra, 1/143)\xa0\nFurther evidence in support of the majority view is the report narrated by Abu Dawud (205) from `Ali ibn Talq (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If one of you breaks wind whilst praying, let him leave and do Wudu, then repeat the prayer.”\nThere is a difference of opinion as to the soundness of this Hadith. It was classed as authentic by Ibn Hibban and as sound by others.\xa0\nIn Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah there is a question about the Hadith, “Whoever breaks wind during the prayer, let him exit the prayer. If that is during a congregational prayer, let him hold his nose and leave, and do Wudu, then let him resume his prayer from where he left off, so long as he does not speak.”\xa0\nThey replied: “This Hadith was classed as inauthentic by some of the leading scholars of Hadith. Hence what it indicates about the one who breaks his Wudu during the prayer exiting the prayer, then doing Wudu and coming back to complete what is left of his prayer, is not correct. Rather breaking Wudu during the prayer renders it invalid, and after doing Wudu the individual has to start the prayer all over again from the beginning, as is indicated by the Hadith of `Ali ibn Talq (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If one of you breaks wind whilst praying, let him leave and do Wudu, then repeat the prayer.” Narrated by Ahmad, Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa’i and Ibn Majah; classed as authentic by Ibn Hibban.” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 5/438, vol. 2)\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “If a person loses his Wudu whilst praying, by breaking wind or having a severe nosebleed and so on, then his prayer is rendered invalid, according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If one of you breaks wind whilst praying, let him leave and do Wudu, then repeat the prayer.” (Narrated by Imam Ahmad and the authors of As-Sunan. This was also mentioned by Al-Hafidh Ibn Hajar in Al-Bulugh)\nWith regard to the Hadith which mentions resuming the prayer from where one left off, this is a weak Hadith, as was also explained by Al-Hafidh Ibn Hajar in Al-Bulugh.” (Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 10/159)\xa0\nWhen to say Taslim in prayer behind the Imam\xa0\nIt is preferable for the one who is praying behind an imam not to say the Taslim after the prayer until the imam has finished the second Taslim .\xa0\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 154587 , 145246 , 42 , and 20958 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/129666/what-to-do-if-wudu-breaks-during-prayer
406458,"If I move to make my life in Japan, will i get the sins of my children & descendance if they divert to islam?","['Praise be to Allah.Living in the land of the disbelievers is fraught with risks, because there is such a great deal of temptation, and the danger for children and grandchildren is greater. They may be compelled to commit objectionable actions in the schools and elsewhere, and the father may not have any control over his son or daughter, so he will not be able to deter them from unlawful relationships or unlawful actions. Thus the child will grow up committing sin, and that may lead to him giving up Islam altogether. The reality in those countries bears witness to that.\nParents are responsible for raising their children and protecting them from the causes that lead to deviation.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{O you who believe, guard yourselves and your families against a fire …}\xa0[at-Tahrim 66:6].\nMujahid and others among the early generations said: Advise your families to fear Allah and discipline them. Qatadah said: Instruct them to obey Allah and forbid them to disobey Him.\nAl-Bukhari (2554) and Muslim (1829) narrated from ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Each of you is in a position of responsibility and each of you is answerable for those under his care. The ruler of the people is in a position of responsibility and is answerable for those under his care. A man is in a position of responsibility over his household and is answerable for those under his care. A woman is in a position of responsibility over her husband’s house and children and is answerable for those under her care. The slave is in a position of responsibility over his master’s wealth and is answerable for it. Indeed, each of you is in a position of responsibility and each of you is answerable for those under his care.”\nCountries vary in the extent of evil that is present in them and the possibility of the children being corrupted or not. The ages of the children also make a difference; protecting younger children is easier than protecting adolescents and older children.\nWhat may be said about parents’ being responsible for their children going astray is that if the parents take measures to keep their children on the right path and avoid things that may lead to their being corrupted, then they will not be questioned about anything else.\nApplying that to the matter under discussion here means that it is not permissible for the parents to move with their children from a Muslim country, where it is most likely that they will be safe from temptation that could lead them away from their religion, especially the major temptations to which those who live in non-Muslim countries are exposed. It is not permissible for the parents to move with their children when they have an alternative to that, even if the standard of living is better and opportunities for higher earnings are available, and other worldly considerations.\nBut if they or their country is faced with some emergency which forces them to move to a non-Muslim country, and they can find no other alternative, then what the parents must do is choose a country in which there is a large number of Muslims and where they are able to practice Islam openly.\nOne of the guidelines on choosing a country in which to live is that there should be schools that are only for Muslims, where their children can study and be safe from seeing nakedness and other evils, and from having to study subjects that promote ideas of disbelief.\nThey should try to teach their children Arabic and Islam, to memorize the Holy Qur’an and attend Jumu‘ah and prayers in congregation.\nIf there is a city like that, there is nothing wrong with the parents moving there, then if the child goes astray after that, there will be no sin on them; that would be comparable to a case in which a child drifts away from Islam when living in a Muslim country.\nBut if there are few Muslims in the country, and perhaps there are no mosques or it is not possible to go to the mosque except on Friday, and there are no Islamic schools, so the children have to study with the local people and learn their customs and see their evils, and study their curricula, then this is an environment which will lead to their going astray. In fact, the basic assumption is that children will go astray. Hence the one who takes his children to such a country is harming them, and is the cause of their becoming corrupted and doomed, and he is responsible for their going astray, let alone their disbelieving and apostatising – Allah forbid.\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no person whom Allah puts in charge of others and he fails to be sincere towards them, but he will not smell the fragrance of Paradise.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (7150_ and Muslim (1442).\nAnd he said: “Allah will question each person in a position of responsibility about what he was responsible for – whether he took care of it or neglected it – until He questions a man about the members of his household.” Narrated by Ibn Hibban; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Ghayat al-Muram, no. 271.\nSo when the father is asked tomorrow about travelling to that land even though he thought it was likely that his children would be corrupted, how will he respond?\nWill he say: O Lord, I was seeking wealth or cleanliness or luxury or freedom or a good education?\nWhat are these things worth if the cost is losing one’s faith?\nThus you will realize that the basic principle is that taking your children to non-Muslim countries is something that is restricted and is not allowed except when one has no other choice and one is able to find a city in which there are the things we mentioned above, namely a large Muslim community with many mosques, schools and other organisations.\nIf the Muslim travels to that country because he has no choice, and settling there is permissible according to Islamic teachings, and he does the things mentioned above to the best of his ability to protect his children, but they still go astray, then there is no sin on him.\nBut if he travels there by his own choice, and he has no Islamically acceptable excuse for settling in that land, and one of his children goes astray, then he is responsible for that, because he is the one who took him towards that evil and made it easily accessible to him.\nFor more information, please see the answers to questions no. 52893 and 224475 .\nWe ask Allah to protect us and you, and the Muslims.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/406458/will-he-bear-the-burden-of-his-childrens-and-grandchildrens-sins-if-they-go-astray-from-islam-in-a-non-muslim-country
