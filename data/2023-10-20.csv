105471,Does hasad (destructive envy) exist in Islam or not?,"['Praise be to Allah.Meaning of hasad\nHasad (destructive envy) means wishing that a blessing that Allah has bestowed on the envied person be taken away. Allah enjoined His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to seek refuge with Him from the evil of the envier when he envies. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Say: ‘I seek refuge with (Allah), the Lord of the daybreak, ‘From the evil of what He has created, ‘And from the evil of the darkening (night) as it comes with its darkness; (or the moon as it sets or goes away), ‘And from the evil of those who practise witchcraft when they blow in the knots, ‘And from the evil of the envier when he envies.’” [al-Falaq 113]\nWhat is meant by “when he envies” is when he manifests what he feels of envy in his heart and acts on it, and his envy makes him do something bad to the one whom he envies.\xa0\nDegrees of hasad\nHasad is of varying degrees:\xa0\n\nWhen a person wants the blessing to be taken away from his Muslim brother, even if it does not come to him; rather he does not like Allah to bless anyone else and that upsets him.\xa0\nWhere he wants the blessing to be taken away from someone else because he wants it, in the hope that it will come to him.\xa0\nWhere he wishes for himself a blessing like that which someone else has, without wanting it to be taken away from the other person. This is permissible and is not called hasad rather it is called ghibtah.\xa0\n\nHow the envier harms himself\nThe envier harms himself in three ways:\xa0\n\nHe earns sin because hasad is haram.\xa0\nIt is bad etiquette before Allah, because what hasad really means is hating Allah’s blessing His slaves, and objecting to what Allah does.\xa0\nHe suffers because of too much worry and distress. \xa0\n\nAnd Allah is the Source of strength. May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and Companions.” (Standing Committee for Academic Research and Issuing Fatwas)\nFor more, please see these answers: 11359 , 20954 , and 125543 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/105471/meaning-of-hasad
262618,"I own a contracting company and I want to run my business in a manner that pleases Allah; I do not want to begin my project with anything that Allah has forbidden. I intended to give some money as a gift to anyone who brings projects to our company, because I cannot get any work, since the consulting engineering companies have engineers who do not advise their clients to go to any contracting companies except those who give a kickback to these engineers in return for awarding their contracts to their companies. I do not know whether it is permissible to pay this money to these engineers, especially since they take it without the knowledge of the owners of these engineering consultancy companies. Is it permissible for me to pay this kickback to them? Is it permissible to give it to someone else?","['Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with you giving money to someone who brings business to your company, whether to an ordinary person or to a consultancy.\nAs for giving this kickback to the engineers who work in the consultancies, without the knowledge of the company owners, that is not permissible, because this is helping them in betraying the owner of the company.\nThis is a summary of what our shaykh, ‘Abd ar-Rahman al-Barrak (may Allah, may He be exalted, preserve him), said.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/262618/ruling-on-giving-a-kickback-or-bribe-to-a-consulting-engineering-company-if-they-give-them-a-project-contract
