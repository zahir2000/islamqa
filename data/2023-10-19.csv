262618,"I own a contracting company and I want to run my business in a manner that pleases Allah; I do not want to begin my project with anything that Allah has forbidden. I intended to give some money as a gift to anyone who brings projects to our company, because I cannot get any work, since the consulting engineering companies have engineers who do not advise their clients to go to any contracting companies except those who give a kickback to these engineers in return for awarding their contracts to their companies. I do not know whether it is permissible to pay this money to these engineers, especially since they take it without the knowledge of the owners of these engineering consultancy companies. Is it permissible for me to pay this kickback to them? Is it permissible to give it to someone else?","['Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with you giving money to someone who brings business to your company, whether to an ordinary person or to a consultancy.\nAs for giving this kickback to the engineers who work in the consultancies, without the knowledge of the company owners, that is not permissible, because this is helping them in betraying the owner of the company.\nThis is a summary of what our shaykh, ‘Abd ar-Rahman al-Barrak (may Allah, may He be exalted, preserve him), said.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/262618/ruling-on-giving-a-kickback-or-bribe-to-a-consulting-engineering-company-if-they-give-them-a-project-contract
114656,"I have a grandfather who is stingy with his property… He has quite a few useful books that he bought when he was young, including some useful Islamic books, some of which are out of print and not available in the market. I am a seeker of knowledge, and I want to make use of them, but he will not let me do that. Is it permissible for me to take them by stealth and make use of them and keep them?","['Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to transgress against the property of another person by stealing, plundering, seizing by force or taking it without his permission, even if that is by way of borrowing. The ruling on the books in this regard is the same as the ruling on other kinds of property, hence the majority of scholars ruled that the hand of one who steals them is to be cut off.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Mughni (9/98): If he steals a Mus-haf, Abu Bakr and al-Qadi said: His hand is not to be cut off for that. This is the view of Abu Hanifah…\nAbu’l-Khattab favoured the view that his hand is to be cut off, and he said: This is the apparent meaning of the words of Ahmad. He was asked about someone who stole a book containing knowledge to study it, and he said: Anything of which the value reaches three dirhams, the hand of the one who steals it is to be cut off. This is the view of Malik, ash-Shafa‘i, Abu Thawr and Ibn al-Mundhir, because of the general meaning of the verses which speak about all thieves.…\nThere is no difference of opinion among our companions regarding the fact that the hand of the thief is to be cut off for stealing books of jurisprudence, hadith and all other Islamic sciences.\nIt says in al-Mawsu ‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (34/193): The Malikis, Shafa‘is and Hanbalis, and Abu Yusuf among the Hanafis, are of the view that the hand of one who steals a beneficial book – such as a book of tafsir, hadith, jurisprudence or other beneficial sciences – is to be cut off, if the value of the stolen item reaches the minimum threshold. End quote.\nSo you have no right to take these books by stealth, or to keep them. Rather you must ask permission, then if he gives you permission and lets you borrow them, all well and good, otherwise you have no right to take them. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “It is not permissible to take the property of anyone unless he gives it willingly.” Narrated by Ahmad (20172); classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami‘ (7662).\nThis is not the only way to seek knowledge. You can come to an agreement with your grandfather to go to his house and read the books there, and not take them away.\nOr you can go to the public library, where – in sha Allah – you will find many useful books.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/114656/ruling-on-taking-books-by-stealth-from-his-grandfather-to-learn-from-them-and-keep-them
20935,"I have eczema which was under control until I started doing Wudu 5 times a day. I have tried everything I can think of, but nothing is helping. What can I do if Wudu is causing very bad rashes?","['Praise be to Allah.Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope.”\xa0[Al-Baqarah 2:286]\nAbu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “… if I forbid you from doing\xa0 something, avoid it, and if I command you to do something, do as much as you can.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 6858; Muslim, 1337)\xa0\nAlthough Allah has clearly commanded us to do Wudu with water, He exempted the sick from having to do Wudu with water and has allowed them to do Tayammum .\xa0Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“O you who believe! Approach not As-Salah (the prayer) when you are in a drunken state until you know (the meaning) of what you utter, nor when you are in a state of Janabah (i.e. in a state of sexual impurity and have not yet taken a bath), except when travelling on the road (without enough water, or just passing through a mosque), till you wash your whole body. And if you are ill, or on a journey, or one of you comes after answering the call of nature, or you have been in contact with women (by sexual relations) and you find no water, do Tayammum with clean earth and rub therewith your faces and hands (Tayammum). Truly, Allah is Ever Oft-Pardoning, Oft-Forgiving.”\xa0[Al-Nisa’ 4:43]\nShaykh Muhammad Al-Salih Al-‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Or if he is afraid of using it or if looking for it will cause him physical harm:\xa0\nIf he will be physically harmed by using water and will become sick, then this comes under the general meaning of the words (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“But if you are ill or on a journey.”\xa0[Al-Maidah 5:6]\nFor example, if there are wounds or sores on the parts of the body that are washed during Wudu, or if there are wounds or sores on all parts of the body, in the case of Ghusl (ritual bath), and there is the fear of physical harm, then he may do Tayammum.” (Al-Sharh Al-Mumti’, 1/378, 379; Ibn Al-Jawzi edition)\xa0\nBut if he can put water on his skin without affecting it, then he should do so, and he does not have to rub that part of the body or go to extremes in washing it.\xa0\nShaykh Muhammad Al-Salih Al-‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Similarly he does not have to go to extremes in rinsing his nose if he has a problem in the sinuses, because in that case the water may settle there and cause an unpleasant smell and make him sick, or it may cause him some harm. It should be said to such a person: it is sufficient for you to rinse your nose until the water enters the nostrils.” (Al-Sharh Al-Mumti’, 1/210, Ibn Al-Jawzi edition)\xa0\nHe also said:\xa0\n“If a person has a sinus problem, or if going to extremes in rinsing the nose will make the water reach the sinuses and cause him pain, or if the water will turn rotten and turn to pus and so on, in this case we say to him: Do not go to extremes in rinsing your nose, so as to ward off harm from yourself.” (Al-Sharh Al-Mumti’, 1/172. Ibn Al-Jawzi edition)\xa0\nIf Wudu will harm your skin or delay your recovery, then you should do Tayammum , and there is no sin on you.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20935/resorting-to-tayammum-if-one-has-eczema
