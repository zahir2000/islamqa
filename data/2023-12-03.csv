464430,"If we did the marriage contract over the Internet, is it permissible to do it again in person after a few months have passed?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIf the marriage contract that was done over the Internet met all the necessary conditions, then it is a valid marriage. It is valid to do the marriage contract over the Internet so long as it meets all the necessary conditions. The senior scholars have issued fatwas stating that a marriage contract done over the telephone is valid, if we have verified the identity of the parties to the marriage contract and it fulfils the necessary conditions, namely the consent of the woman’s guardian (wali), two witnesses, and the proposal and acceptance. If a marriage contract done in this way is valid, then if it is done over the Internet, in which it is possible to verify the voice and the image directly, it is more appropriate that it should be valid.\nSee the fatwa of Shaykh Ibn Baz in question no. 2201 , and also question no. 297344 .\nSecondly:\nIf the first marriage contract met the necessary conditions, then repeating it a second time will not invalidate the first marriage contract; rather it is by way of confirming it in front of the family, or for the purpose of documenting the first marriage contract. So the rulings on marriage will apply from the time of the first contract. Hence it is not valid to impose new conditions in it, or to stipulate a mahr (dowry) other than that which was agreed upon in the first contract. But if the first marriage contract did not meet the necessary conditions, then it is deemed invalid and a new marriage contract must be done with a new mahr, and it is permissible to stipulate new conditions in it.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/464430/what-is-the-ruling-on-repeating-the-marriage-contract-if-it-was-done-over-the-internet
209517,How can a person fulfil his religious obligations of Wudu and prayer when his right arm is broken and is in a cast?,"['Praise be to Allah.How to make Wudu with a cast\xa0\nIf a person is unable to move his right arm and use it when doing acts of worship, then he must be careful to adhere to the following Shar`i rulings:\nWudu and Ghusl are obligatory and are not waived because of his right arm being broken , because he can use his left arm to take water and make it reach the parts of the body that must be washed when purifying himself. He must be careful and deliberate when doing that to ensure that the act of purification is done properly.\nWith regard to the right arm which is broken and in a cast , it is sufficient, when doing Wudu and Ghusl, to wipe over it lightly so that the plaster will not be affected, and it can be wiped once only and does not have to be done repeatedly, unlike washing the arm [as is usually done]. Thus the act of purification will be sound, in sha Allah. It is also essential to note that the fingers or elbow of the right hand, if they are uncovered, must be washed; wiping is only acceptable with regard to the part that is hidden beneath the cast.\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Sometimes the cast covers the palm and the fingers are not covered. In that case, it is obligatory to wash the fingers and the cast may be wiped over. Similarly, in the case of [a cast on] the leg , the toes may be not covered, so they must be washed and the cast must be wiped over.” (Al-Liqa’ Ash-Shahri, 61/27)\nHow to pray with a cast\nWith regard to prayer, the actions of the right arm may be summed up as follows:\n\nRaising the arm when saying the four Takbirs (when commencing the prayer (Takbirat Al-ihram), when bowing, when standing up from bowing, and when rising from the first Tashahhud).\nPlacing the right hand over the left hand when standing.\nResting on the arm when prostrating.\nPlacing the hands on the thighs when sitting.\nPointing with the forefinger when reciting the Tashahhud.\n\nIn all of these cases, if you can move the arm that is in plaster and do these actions if possible, then that is better and is preferable. If you are not able to complete the full movement with your arm, then you should do as much as you are able. If you are not able to move it, then there is no blame on you, and you only have to move the left arm when doing these actions, with the exception of pointing with the forefinger, which should be done only with the right hand.\nThe Shar`i evidence for all of the above is two general juristic principles, for which are proven by many religious texts of the Quran and authentic Sunnah.\n\nThe first principle: Hardship dictates leniency. The evidence for which is the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “Allah does not burden any soul with more than it can bear” [Al-Baqarah 2:286]\nThe second principle: What one is able to do cannot be waived on the grounds of what one is unable to do. The evidence for which is the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “So fear Allah as much as you are able.” [At-Taghabun 64:16] This is an important principle concerning which the scholars say: “It is one of the basic principles that cannot be overlooked so long as the principles of Shari`ah are adhered to.” (Al-Ashbah wan-Nadha’ir by As-Suyuti, p. 293)\n\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“There are many religious texts which indicate that the actions that are enjoined are subject to the condition that one be able to do them, as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to `Imran ibn Husayn: “Pray standing; if you cannot, then sitting; and if you cannot then lying on your side.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 1117)\nThe Muslims unanimously agreed that if a worshipper is unable to do some of the obligatory parts of the prayer – such as standing, sitting, bowing, prostrating, covering the `Awrah, facing the Qiblah, and so on – then what he is unable to do is waived in his case. Rather what he is obliged to do is that which, if he seriously wanted to do it, he could do it.\xa0\nIt is important to note that the Shar`i definition of one’s ability to comply with the commands and prohibitions is not the ability to do so even if it leads to harm. In fact if a person is able to do something but it would harm him , then he is regarded as being like one who is unable to do it in many instances, such as purifying himself with water, fasting when he is ill, standing in the prayer, and so on, in accordance with the words of Allah, may He be exalted (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Allah intends for you ease and does not intend for you hardship.”\xa0[Al-Baqarah 2:185]\n“[Allah] has not placed upon you in the religion any difficulty.”\xa0[Al-Hajj 22:78]\n“Allah does not intend to make difficulty for you.”\xa0[Al-Ma’idah 5:6]\nIn an authentic narration from Anas (may Allah be pleased with him), the Prophet (blessings and peace be upon him) said: “You have been sent to make things easy, and you have not been sent to make things difficult.” (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 8/438-439)\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/209517/how-to-make-wudu-with-a-cast
134346,"Recently it has become common practice for the one who loses something to recite Surat al-Duha, and by Allah’s leave he will find what he lost, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {And your Lord is going to give you, and you will be satisfied} [al-Duha 93:5]. But the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not do that, so how should we respond to those who say that?","['Praise be to Allah.Allah has perfected the religion for us, as He, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {This day I have perfected for you your religion and completed My favor upon you and have approved for you Islam as religion} [al-Ma’idah 5:3].\nAnd the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) conveyed it to us in full, so we do not need anyone to add anything to what Allah, may He be exalted, has prescribed for us.\nIf anyone adds to what Allah has prescribed, then he must be one of two things: either he does not believe that Islam is perfect, or he is accusing the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) of having failed to convey the religion to us in full.\nHence al-Shatibi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIslam came perfect, and nothing can be added to it or taken away from it, because Allah, may He be exalted, says regarding it (interpretation of the meaning): {This day I have perfected for you your religion and completed My favor upon you and have approved for you Islam as religion} [al-Ma’idah 5:3].\nAnd it is proven that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not die until he had explained in detail everything that is needed with regard to both religious and worldly matters. None of Ahl al-Sunnah differs regarding this.\nAs that is the case of the one who uses innovation, then what he is saying, implicitly or explicitly, is that Islam is not yet perfect, and that there remain matters which must or should be added, because if he believed that Islam is complete and perfect in every respect, he would not have introduced any innovation or added something to the religion. The one who thinks that is misguided and has gone astray from the straight path.\nIbn al-Majishon said: I heard Malik say: Whoever introduces an innovation into Islam that he thinks is good is claiming that Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) betrayed the message, because Allah may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {This day I have perfected for you your religion} [al-Ma’idah 5:3]. Whatever was not part of the religion on that day cannot be part of it today.""(Al-I‘tisam\xa0 p. 33).\nShaykh Bakr Abu Zayd (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nOne of the innovations is singling something out without evidence, such as singling out a particular verse or a particular surah to be recited at a particular time, or in a particular place, or for a particular need, and so on, singling things out without evidence.\nExamples of that include:\n\nReciting al-Fatihah with the intention of having needs met or being granted relief from hardship.\nReciting Surah Ya-Sin forty times with the intention of having needs met.""(Bida‘ al-Qira’ah\xa0 p. 14-15).\n\nSingling out the recitation of Surat al-Duha when losing something is an innovation that comes under the heading of innovations that are invented by one who does not properly appreciate the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nFor if they had truly appreciated the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), they would not have added anything to what he prescribed for us at all.\nWe ask Allah, may He be exalted, to make us among those who adhere to the practice of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and that of his companions.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/134346/ruling-on-reciting-surat-al-duha-when-one-has-lost-something

They include the following:\n\nAhmad (3712) narrated that `Abdullah ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “No person suffers any anxiety or grief , and says: ‘Allahumma inni `abduka wabnu `abdika wabnu amatika, nasiyati bi yadika, madin fiyya hukmuka, `adlun fiyya qada’uka, as’aluka bi kulli ismin huwa laka sammayta bihi nafsaka aw `allamtahu ahadan min khalqika aw anzaltahu fi kitabika aw ista’tharta bihi fi `ilm il-ghaybi `andak an taj`ala Al-Qurana rabi`a qalbi wa nura sadri wa jala’a huzni wa dhahaba hammi (O Allah, I am Your slave, son of Your slave, son of Your female slave, my forelock is in Your hand, Your command over me is forever executed and Your decree over me is just.

He (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Yes indeed; whoever hears them should learn them.”\xa0(Classed as authentic by Al-Albaani in\xa0Sahih At-Targhib wa At-Tarhib, 1822)\nMuslim (2713) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to tell us, when any one of us wanted to lie down and sleep, to say: “Allahumma Rabb As-samawati wa Rabb Al-ardi wa Rabb Al-`Arsh il-`Adhim, Rabbana wa Rabba kulli shay’, faliq Al-habbi wan-nawa wa munzil At-Tawrati wal-Injili wal-Furqan, a`udhu bika min sharri kulli dabbatin anta akhidhun bi nasiyatiha.

And if you have debt like the mountain of Sir, Allah will pay it off for you . He said: “Say: Allahumma ikfini bi halalika `an haramika wa aghnini bi fadlika `amman siwaka (O Allah, suffice me with what You have permitted so that I have no need of that which You have forbidden, and make me independent of means by Your bounty so that I have no need of anyone besides You).’”\xa0 (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 3563; classes as sound by Al-Albani in\xa0Sahih At-Tirmidhi)\nAt-Tabarani narrated in\xa0Al-Mu`jam As-Saghir\xa0that Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to Mu`adh (may Allah be pleased with him): ‘Shall I not teach you a Du`a which you may say; even if you have debt like Mount Uhud, Allah might pay it off for you?’ Say, O Mu’adh: ‘Allahumma Malik Al-mulk, tu’ti Al-mulka man tasha’ wa tanzi` Al-mulka mimman tasha’, wa tu`izzu man tasha’ wa tudhillu man tasha’, bi yadika Al-khayr, innaka `ala kulli shay’in qadir, Rahman Ad-dunya wal-akhirati wa rahimahuma, tu‘tihima man tasha’ wa tamna`u minhuma man tasha’, irhamni rahmatan tughnini biha `an rahmati man siwaka (O Allah, Sovereign of all, You give dominion to whomsoever You will and You take dominion away from whomsoever You will, You exalt whomsoever You will and You bring low whomsoever You will.

With regard to whatever Allah has prescribed of Adhkar, supplication and all other acts of worship that are not limited to a specific time, number, place or manner, it is not permissible for us to commit ourselves to a particular manner, time or number; rather we worship Allah by doing these acts of worship with no restrictions, as they were prescribed. Whatever is proven on the basis of reports which indicate on the basis of the Prophet’s words or deeds that they are limited to a particular time or number, or limited to a particular place or manner, we worship Allah by doing them in accordance with what is proven by the religious texts.” (Shaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn Baz, Shaykh `Abd Ar-Razzaq `Afifi, Shaykh `Abdullah ibn Ghadyan, Shaykh `Abdullah ibn Qa`ud.""
