270518,Please forgive me if my question sounds inappropriate. I need some guidance. I have been married for 15 yrs. Initially we exchanged French kisses but then hec started getting ill and hence for some reason or other would verbally abuse me. So I completely stopped kissing even though we would get intimate. Life has moved on but he has anger problems and this gets verbally abusive. He has requested many times for can French kiss and I just am trying my best but I feel how can I kiss a mouth that has said such and such words to me. My question is am I sinning? Should I forget and satisfy his desire?,"['Praise be to Allah.It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If a woman prays her five (daily prayers), fasts her month (Ramadan), guards her chastity and obeys her husband, she will enter whichever of the gates of paradise she wishes.” Narrated by Ibn Hibbaan (4163); classed as sahih by al-Albani.\nTherefore it is obligatory for the wife to obey her husband, so long as it does not involve disobedience towards Allah. This is one of the greatest of good deeds that may lead to paradise, after the woman fulfils her religious duties.\nWhilst we appreciate that you are suffering, we advise you to push yourself to respond to your husband’s request as much as you can, and we do not advise you to respond in the same way as he treats you, or to refuse intimacy with him because of his mistreatment, or to respond in kind, even though all of that is permissible for you and you cannot be blamed for it. Rather we advise you to try hard to treat him kindly as much as you can, and to make yourself respond to what he asks of you with regard to intimacy, or even to hasten to do what you know he likes before he asks you for it.\nWe advise all of the above for two reasons:\nFirstly, responding to his mistreatment in kind, even though it is legitimate justice between people, between spouses it only makes the problems worse and does not solve them. No relationship could continue between the spouses in that case; rather it is essential for them to interact with wisdom, forbearance, kindness and deliberation. Every time your husband shows harshness and strictness, wisdom dictates that you should respond in a soft manner; if he becomes stubborn regarding any issue, reason dictates that you should be easy-going regarding that matter, unless it involves sin or severing ties of kinship.\nSecondly, Allah, may He be exalted, has taught these good manners to His slaves and shown them the wisdom behind them and the great interest that may be served by adhering to them. He, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And not equal are the good deed and the bad. Repel [evil] by that [deed] which is better; and thereupon the one whom between you and him is enmity [will become] as though he was a devoted friend.\nBut none is granted it except those who are patient, and none is granted it except one having a great portion [of good]}\xa0[Fussilat 41:34-35].\nIf that etiquette is something that Allah has taught to all people when dealing with one another, then how about the interaction between spouses?\nWhatever you are unable to do or cannot bear it, so you do not do it because of what you feel of hurt sometimes, we hope that there will be no sin on you for that, and that you will be excused for it, on condition that this does not become your habit or the regular way in which you deal with your husband, and you do not use it as a means to solve problems between you. For that will only make matters more complicated and will not solve anything; rather it is like letting off steam most of the time or sometimes. The basic principle regarding your relationship with your husband is that you should obey him so long as it does not involve disobedience towards Allah, and you should give him his rights. If he disobeys Allah in the way he treats you, you should still obey Allah in the way you treat him, and try to make yourself do that as much as you can. Perhaps that may be a means of making him mend his ways and change his attitude, and come back to behaving in the way you like and treating you in an honourable manner.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/270518/ruling-on-the-wife-refusing-some-kinds-of-foreplay-because-she-is-subjected-to-verbal-abuse-by-her-husband
70577,"When we want to say some Dhikrs, is it obligatory to move the mouth? For example, when we want to enter the bathroom and recite Dhikr, should we move our mouths or is it sufficient to say it in our minds? And when we want to go to sleep or say the Adhkar for the morning?","[""Praise be to Allah.Forms of Performing Dhikr\nRemembering Allah (Dhikr) is one of the noblest deeds that a Muslim can do. Dhikr is not only verbal; rather we may remember Allah in our hearts, on our lips and in our physical actions.\xa0\nShaykh `Abd Ar-Rahman ibn Si`di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“The phrase Dhikr Allah (remembrance of Allah) includes everything by means of which a person may draw close to Allah, such as belief (`Aqidah), thoughts, actions of the heart, physical actions, praising Allah, learning and teaching beneficial knowledge, and so on. All of that is remembrance of Allah.” (Ar-Riyad An-Nadirah, p. 245)\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Remembrance of Allah (Dhikr) may be in the heart, on the tongue or in one’s physical actions. The basic principle is remembrance in the heart as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “In the body there is a piece of flesh which, if it is sound, the entire body will be sound, but if it is corrupt the entire body will be corrupt. It is the heart.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim) What counts is remembrance in the heart, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And obey not him whose heart We have made heedless of Our remembrance, and who follows his own lusts.”\xa0[Al-Kahf 18:28]\nRemembering Allah with one's tongue or physical actions without remembering Him in one's heart is a serious shortcoming; it is like a body without a soul.\xa0\nRemembering Allah in one's heart means thinking about the signs of Allah, loving Him, venerating Him, turning in repentance to Him, fearing Him, putting one's trust in Him, and other actions of the heart.\xa0\nRemembering Allah on one's tongue means speaking all words that will bring one closer to Allah, above all saying La ilaha ill-Allah.\xa0\nRemembering Allah with one's physical actions means every deed which brings one closer to Allah, such as standing, bowing and prostrating in prayer, engaging in jihad, paying Zakah. All of these are remembrance of Allah, because when you do them you are obeying Allah. Hence you are remembering Allah when you do these actions. Hence Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“and perform As-Salah (Iqamat As-Salah). Verily, As-Salah (the prayer) prevents from Al-Fahsha’ (i.e. great sins of every kind, unlawful sexual intercourse) and Al-Munkar (i.e. disbelief, polytheism, and every kind of evil wicked deed) and the remembering(praising) of (you by) Allah (in front of the angels) is greater indeed [than your remembering (praising) of Allah in prayers].” [Al-`Ankabut 29:45]\nOne of the scholars said: this means that what prayer includes remembrance of Allah is more important. This is one of the two scholarly views concerning this verse.” (Tafsir Surat Al-Baqarah, 2/167, 168)\xa0\nCan we do Dhikr without moving lips?\nWith regard to the Adhkar which are spoken on the tongue, such as reciting Quran, saying Tasbih (Subhan Allah – glory be to Allah), Tahmid (Al-hamdu Lillah – praise be to Allah) and Tahlil (La ilaha ill-Allah – there is none worthy of worship but Allah), and the Dhikrs to be recited in the morning and evening , when going to sleep, when entering the washroom, and so on, it is essential to move the tongue, and a person is not regarded as having said them if he does not move his tongue.\xa0\nIbn Rushd (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated in Al-Bayan wat Tahsil (1/490) that Imam Malik (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about a person who recites when praying, but no one can hear him, not even himself, and he does not move his tongue. He said: “This is not recitation, rather recitation is that in which the tongue moves.”\xa0\nAl-Kasani (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Bada’i` Al-Sana’i` (4/118)\xa0\n“Recitation can only be done by moving the tongue to say the sounds. Do you not see that if a worshipper who is able to recite does not move his tongue, his prayer is not acceptable? Similarly he swears that he does not recite a Surah from the Quran but he looks at it and understands it but he does not move his tongue, then he is not breaking his oath.”\xa0 This is because he has not recited it, rather he has only looked at it. \xa0\nThis is also indicated by the fact that the scholars said it is not allowed for a person who is Junub to recite Quran with his tongue, but they said it is permissible for him to look at the Mus-haf and recite Quran in his heart, without moving his tongue.”\xa0\nThis indicates that there is a difference between the two things, and that not moving the tongue is not counted as reading or reciting.\xa0 (See Al-Majmu`, 1/187-189)\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Is it obligatory to move the tongue when reciting the Quran in prayer or is it sufficient to say it in one's heart?\n\xa0He replied:\xa0\n“Recitation must be done with the tongue. If a person recites it in his heart when he is praying, that is not sufficient. The same applies to all other Adhkar; it is not sufficient to recite them in one's heart, rather it is essential to move one's tongue and lips, because they are words to be spoken, and that can only be achieved by moving the tongue and the lips.” (Majmu` Fatawa Ibn `Uthaymin, 13/156)\nFor more details, please refer to the following answers: 258651 , 139841 , 194998 , and 10491 .\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/70577/can-we-do-dhikr-without-moving-the-tongue-and-lips
