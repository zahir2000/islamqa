506997,Is praying to increase ones height considered as the transgressions of dua?,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nWhen a person has passed the growth stage, meaning that it is usually not possible to increase in height, then praying to increase one’s height is a transgression of du`a (supplication).\nWhat we have found out regarding the age at which a man stops growing is:\nA growth spurt begins in males at the onset of puberty – i.e., between 10 and 13 years of age – and usually they continue to grow until the age of 16, but growth may continue after that time until the early 20s.\nIn response to a question about when a man stops growing, there are other factors which may affect that, such as:\n\nGenes inherited from the father and mother. This is one of the most significant factors that may play an important role in growth, as it has an impact of 80% on how much a person will grow.\nLevels of hormones in the blood, such as growth hormones, thyroid hormones and reproductive hormones, and whether there is any problem with the levels of these hormones.\nDiet and the extent to which essential nutrients are found in it.\nActivity levels during childhood.\nThe mother’s nutrition during pregnancy.\nThe individual’s state of health and whether there are any chronic illnesses that could affect growth.\nThe presence of genetic discrepancies in some hereditary conditions, such as Down syndrome and Marfan syndrome.\n\nEnd quote from at-Tibb website.\nIf specialist doctors state that a man has reached an age after which it is usually impossible for him to grow any further, then praying for an increase in height is a transgression of du`a, because of what it involves of poor etiquette towards Allah by asking Him to do something different to what He has decreed for His creation.\nAbu Dawud (96), Ibn Majah (3864) and Ahmad (16847) narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn Mughaffal heard his son say: O Allah, I ask You for the white palace on the right-hand side of Paradise, if I enter it. He said: O my son, ask Allah for Paradise and seek refuge with Him from Hell, for I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “There will be people among this ummah who will transgress in purification and supplication.”\nThis hadith was classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud.\nAl-Qarafi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The second category of that which is prohibited but does not reach the level of disbelief is when a supplicant asks Allah, may He be exalted, for things that are ordinarily impossible unless one is a prophet, for the usual practice of the prophets (blessings and peace be upon them) is to do extraordinary feats or miracles, so that is permissible for them, as they called for a table to be sent down from heaven, and for the she-camel to be brought forth from the solid rock…\nAs for what is prohibited, there are several examples:\n1. Asking Allah, may He be exalted, to make you have no need to breathe air, so as to be protected from suffocation, when usually that is impossible.\n2. Asking Allah, may He be exalted, for freedom from sickness all your life, so that you can benefit from your strength, senses and physical faculties throughout your life, when usually that is impossible.\n3. Asking Allah, may He be exalted, for a child without having intercourse, or for fruits without planting and tending trees, when usually that is impossible, so asking for that constitutes poor etiquette towards Allah, may He be exalted…\nRather every wise person must understand the way in which Allah, may He be exalted, manages and controls His creation, and he should recognise the connection between cause and effect in this world and the hereafter, whilst acknowledging the possibility that by His power, effects may come about through other causes or without any cause at all, for in fact Allah, may He be exalted, has ordained His dominion according to a particular system and has set it up with all the natural laws that He has ordained and decreed, and He is not to be questioned about what He does [al-Anbiya’ 21:23]. So if the supplicant asks Allah, may He be exalted, to change His dominion and go against the system that He has ordained, and to do things in a manner other than that in which He usually does them in His dominion, then he is showing poor etiquette towards Allah, may He be glorified and exalted; in fact that would be poor etiquette towards the lowest of rulers and even governors.""(Al-Furuq\xa0 4/368).\nSecondly:\nWhat is meant by the jawline is the outline of the jaw and its shape from the side.\nThere is nothing wrong with defining the jawline by means of exercises, but not by means of surgery or injecting fillers.\nThese exercises – according to what we found out – have other benefits besides defining the jawline.

219643,I heard that it is not permissible for a man to wear shoes that cover the top of the feet when doing tawaf (during Ihram – this is the view of a number of Hanafis). Is that true? Or is it permissible to wear all kinds of shoes?,"['Praise be to Allah.What the pilgrim in Ihram may wear on his feet is of several kinds, for each of which there is a ruling. In general terms, they may be summed up in three categories:\xa0\nProhibited footwear for pilgrims in Ihram\n\nThat which covers the entire foot , plus the ankles [which are the two bones that protrude at the joint between the leg and the foot], such as the Khuff (a type of leather slipper have comes up past the ankle), boots that cover the ankle, army boots, and so on.\n\nSuch shoes are not permissible for the pilgrim in Ihram to wear, because of the report narrated by Al-Bukhari (1543) and Muslim (1177) from `Abdullah ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which a man said: O Messenger of Allah, what garments can the pilgrim in Ihram wear? The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “He should not wear chemises, head coverings, pants, burnooses, or Khufuf (leather slippers), except for one who cannot find sandals, in which case he may wear Khufuf, but he should cut them so that they come lower than the ankles.”\xa0\nThis Hadith clearly states that it is prohibited for the pilgrim in Ihram to wear Khufuf, and this is applicable by analogy to similar footwear that also covers the entire foot and ankle.\xa0\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Wearing the Khuff (leather slipper) is prohibited for the man who is in Ihram, and this is agreed upon, whether the Khuff is intact or has holes in it, because of the general meaning of the authentic Hadith.” (Al-Majmu` Sharh Al-Muhadhdhab, 7/258)\xa0\nPermissible sandals for pilgrims in Ihram\n\nThe sandal is that which is the same size as the sole of the foot, but leaves the top of the feet, the heels and the ankles uncovered. There is nothing wrong with wearing it (when in Ihram).\xa0\n\nIn fact it is proven in the Sunnah that it is recommended to enter Ihram wearing sandals. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Let one of you enter Ihram wearing an Izar (waist wrapper or lower garments), Rida’ (upper garment) and sandals.” (Narrated by Ahmad in his Musnad, 8/500; classed as authentic by Ibn Khuzaymah, 2601)\xa0\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “With regard to sandals, it is permissible to wear them no matter how they look, and it is not necessary to cut anything from them, because the ruling that they are permissible was narrated in general terms.” (Al-Mughni, 5/123)\xa0\nAl-Juwayni (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“With regard to sandals, they may be worn by the pilgrim in Ihram, even if they have a strap that comes over the top of the foot. There is nothing wrong with anything that is called sandals, even if the straps are wide. There may be a need to make it wide if one wants to walk for long distances.” (Nihayat Al-Matlab fi Dirayat Al-Madhhab, 4/251)\xa0\nIn Tuhfat Al-Muhtaj (4/162) it says:\n“What is meant by sandals is a kind of footwear that does not cover all the toes.”\xa0\nIt says in Matalib uli An-Nuha (2/329):\n“It is permissible for the pilgrim in Ihram to wear sandals, even if the sandal has a strap going across the foot and another strap going around the heel.”\xa0\nThe point is that it does not matter if the sandal has straps that help to keep it on the foot, whether the straps go across the toes or around the heel.\xa0\nControversy over footwear that covers the ankles\n\nIf the shoe does not cover the ankles, but it covers the rest of the foot, such as the toes, the top of the foot and the heel, then there is a difference of scholarly opinion as to whether it may be worn (in Ihram), because of the difference of opinion as to whether it resembles the Khuff (leather slipper) or sandal. Some scholars think that because it covers most of the foot, it should be regarded as being like the Khuff and should be disallowed for that reason. Others think that because it does not cover the ankles, it comes under the same ruling as sandals and is permissible. The majority of scholars are of the view that it is prohibited to wear anything that covers the foot, even if it does not cover the ankles, whether it covers all of the toes at the front or covers all of the heels, or covers the top of the foot.\xa0\n\nIn Minah Al-Jalil Sharh Mukhtasar Khalil (2/260) it says: “No sandals should be worn except those that have two straps to tie them to the foot, so that one may walk easily. It is not permissible for him to wear any shoes that have a wide strap going around the heel and a wide strap going over the top of the feet, because that results in covering much of the foot.”\xa0\nAbu Ishaq Ash-Shirani (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Wearing Khufuf that have been cut so that they come lower than the ankle, when sandals are available, is not permissible, and compensation must be offered for that… because it is a garment that is fitted to that part of the body, and it resembles the Khuff (leather slipper).”\xa0 (Al-Muhadhdhab fi Fiqh Al-Imam Ash-Shafa`I, 1/381)\xa0\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“With regard to wearing Khufuf that have been cut to come lower than the ankle, is it permissible to wear them when sandals are available? There are two well-known points of view concerning that which were mentioned by the author and his companions. The correct view, according to their consensus, is that it is prohibited; this is what is implied by the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in the authentic Hadith mentioned above: “Whoever cannot find sandals, let him wear Khufuf, but let him cut them so that they come lower than the ankles.” (Al-Majmu` Sharh Al-Muhadhdhab, 7/258)\xa0\nAl-Mawirdi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Because the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) permitted the wearing of Khufuf that have been cut down, on condition that the individual does not possess any sandals, if that condition is not met, then it cannot be assumed to be permissible.” (Al-Hawi Al-Kabir, 4/97)\xa0\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Wearing cut-down Khufuf, when sandals are available, is an action for which compensation must be paid, and he (the pilgrim in Ihram) does not have the right to wear them. This was stated by Ahmad, and this was also the view of Malik… because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) stipulated, when he said that it was permissible to wear them, that one should not have any sandals. This indicates that (wearing cut-down Khufuf) is not permissible when a person does have sandals. Moreover, they are tailored to fit that part of the body. So the pilgrim in Ihram must give compensation if he wears them (without a valid excuse), as in the case of gloves (if worn by a woman in Ihram).” (Al-Mughni, 5/122)\xa0\nThis view was favoured by Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him), who said:\n“With regard to rubber boots that come below the ankles , some scholars say that there is nothing wrong with that, because the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said, according to the hadith of `Abdullah ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), “Whoever cannot find sandals, let him wear Khufuf, but let him cut them so that they come lower than the ankles.” He said: That is because, if they are cut so that they come lower than the ankles, they become like sandals.\xa0\nBut the apparent meaning of the Sunnah is that the ruling is general, so the correct view is that it is prohibited, and that it is not permissible for the pilgrim in\xa0 Ihram to wear (western-style) shoes, even if they come below the ankles.” (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 22/136)\xa0\nShaykh Muhammad Al-Mukhtar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“It is not permissible for the pilgrim in Ihram to wear shoes that cover his feet or most of his feet; rather he should wear shoes that do not cover most of the foot. If the shoes cover part of the foot, then his toes should be uncovered, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “…let him cut them so that they come lower than the ankles.” Based on that, the toes should be uncovered, and based on that, if the shoe covers the ends of the toes, then it is not permissible to wear it, like the kind of slipper that covers the front of the foot. This should not be worn.” ( Sharh Zad Al-Mustaqni`, 5/135)\nThe Hanafis are of the view that it is permissible to wear something that covers the foot on condition that it does not cover the ankles. So if a person wears a shoe that covers the front of the foot and the heel and the top of the foot, there is nothing wrong with that so long as it does not cover the ankles.\nThey quoted as evidence the fact that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) advised a person who could not find any sandals to wear the Khufuf and cut them so that they came lower than the ankles, which suggests that after cutting it, it has been transformed from a form that is prohibited to a form that is permissible, which indicates that it is permissible to wear anything that comes lower than the ankles.\xa0\nAl-Kasani (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Some of our later shaykhs granted a concession allowing the wearing of shoes, by analogy with the cut-down Khufuf, because it is similar to it.” ( Bada’i` As-Sana’i`, 2/184)\xa0\nAs-Sarkhasi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Based on that, our later shaykhs said: There is nothing wrong with the pilgrim in Ihram wearing that which does not cover the ankle, so it is like sandals.” (Al-Mabsut, 4/127)\xa0\nIn Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah (2/154) it says: “The Malikis, Shafa`is and Hanbalis included with the Khuffayn any footwear that covers part of the feet, so they did not regard it as permissible to wear Khuffayn that are cut to come below the ankle, except in cases where sandals are not available. If sandals are available, then it is not permissible for him to wear them (the cut-down Khuffayn), and he must take them off if he has put them on. But if he has put them on because of an excuse such as illness, then he is not sinning and he does not have to offer compensation.\xa0\nAs for the Hanafis, they said: Anything that does not cover the ankles is permissible for the pilgrim in Ihram to wear.”\xa0\nThis view was favoured by Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him).\xa0\nHe said:\n“The correct view is that it is permissible to wear anything that comes below the ankles, whether sandals are available or not.” (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 26/110)\xa0\nHe said concerning the Hadith, “If he cannot find sandals, let him wear Khufuf , but let him cut them so that they come lower than the ankles”:\n“This indicates that that which has been cut down to be like sandals is permissible to be worn in all cases, and one may wear things that are similar to them, of various kinds of footwear. This is the view of Abu Hanifah and is one of the views narrated from Imam Ahmad and others. My grandfather Abu’l-Barakat (may Allah have mercy on him) used to issue fatwas to this effect towards the end of his life, when he did Hajj.\xa0\nRather the hadith mentions the one who cannot find sandals because cutting the Khufuf when sandals are available is damaging the Khufuf and wasting wealth unnecessarily, which is prohibited. That is different from the case when there are no Khufuf. This has been made an alternative in that case, so as not to waste wealth.” (Al-Fatawa Al-Kubra, 1/327)\xa0\nAnd he said:\n“The words “let him wear Khufuf, but let him cut them so that they come lower than the ankles” clearly indicate what is permissible to wear and what makes it different than the Khufuf, which is disallowed, and makes it like sandals which is permissible. Otherwise there would be no difference between wearing cut-down Khufuf and intact Khufuf. This is a concession granted to the one who cannot find sandals, because of what is mentioned above. Moreover, a concession was granted after that allowing people to wear Khufuf and pants, for one who has no alternative.\xa0\nMoreover, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) only forbade the pilgrim in Ihram to wear Khufuf and he allowed wiping over the Khufuf; the cut-down Khufuf and other types of shoes are not Khufuf and do not come under the same heading as Khufuf, so they are not included in the prohibition just as they are not included in what may be wiped over, especially when forbidding the pilgrim to wear the Khufuf implies that it is permissible for him to wear other things, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was asked about what garments the pilgrim in Ihram may wear, and he said: ““He should not wear such and such…” So so he limited what the pilgrim is forbidden to wear, and whatever he did not mention is permissible.\xa0\nMoreover, if the foot needs to be covered, then that which is required by necessity must inevitably be permitted. Many people cannot walk in sandals, so it is essential that they be granted a concession allowing them to wear other kinds of footwear.” (Sharh `Umdat Al-Qari, 3/46)\xa0\nThis view is also favoured by Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him), who said:\xa0\n“If someone wears Western-style shoes that come below the ankles, that does not matter, because they come under the same heading as sandals according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions, and because the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to the one who could not find any sandals: “let him wear Khufuf, but let him cut them so that they come lower than the ankles.”\xa0\nThis indicates that those that have been cut down come under the same heading as sandals, and many of the scholars regarded as correct the view which says that it is permissible to wear Khufuf without cutting them down if no sandals are available.\xa0\nIn conclusion, that which is cut down is that which is cut so that it comes below the ankle; there is nothing wrong with this. So if a shoe comes below the ankle and does not cover the ankle, then the ruling on it is the same as the ruling on sandals, and there is nothing wrong with that.” (Fatawa Nur `ala Ad-Darb, 17/275)\xa0\nAnd he said:\xa0\n“It is permissible for the pilgrim in Ihram to wear Khufuf that come below the ankles, because they come under the same heading as sandals.” (At-Tahqiq wal Idah, p. 34)\xa0\nAlthough the view of the Hanafis, which was also favoured by Shaykh Al-Islam (may Allah have mercy on him) and other scholars, is strong in terms of evidence and rationality, it is more on the safe side for the Muslim and his worship not to do that, especially since sandals are available and plentiful, unless there is a need for that, such as if he is someone who will be harmed by wearing sandals or he cannot easily walk in them.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/219643/what-shoes-to-wear-for-hajj-and-umrah
209165,What is the ruling on one who does `Umrah and starts Sa`i from Al-Marwah instead of As-Safa?,"['Praise be to Allah.What the one who does Sa`i between As-Safa and Al-Marwah must do is begin with that with which Allah, may He be Exalted, began and with which His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) began. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily! As-Safa and Al-Marwah (two mountains in Makkah) are of the Symbols of Allah. So it is not a sin on him who performs Hajj or `Umrah (pilgrimage) of the House (the Ka`bah at Makkah) to perform the going (Tawaf) between them (As-Safa and Al-Marwah). And whoever does good voluntarily, then verily, Allah is All-Recogniser, All-Knower” [Al-Baqarah 2:158].\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) began his Sa`i with As-Safa, and he said: “I begin with that with which Allah began.” The more correct view is that doing Sa`i in the proper order is obligatory. So the one who begins with Al-Marwah first cannot count his first lap, and he must do another lap.\xa0\nShaykh Muhammad Al-Amin Ash-Shinqiti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“It must be understood that the majority of scholars stipulate that Sa`i must be done in the proper order, which means beginning at As-Safa and ending at Al-Marwah. If he starts at Al-Marwah, that lap is not counted. Among those who stipulated that it must be done in the proper order are: Malik, Ash-Shafi`i and Ahmad, and their companions, and Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Al-Awza`i, Dawud and the majority of the scholars.\xa0\nConflicting views were narrated from Abu Hanifah concerning that:\xa0\nThe author of Tabyin Al-Haqa’iq Sharh Kanz Ad-Daqa’iq, which is a book on the Fiqh of Imam Abu Hanifah (may Allah have mercy on him), said:\n“If a person begins Sa`i from Al-Marwah, the first lap should not be counted, because he has gone against the command.”\xa0\nShaykh Shihab Ad-Din Ahmad Ash-Shalabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said, in his footnote to Tabyin Ad-Daqa’iq:\n“With regard to his words “If a person begins Sa`i from Al-Marwah, the first lap should not be counted”, in Manasik Al-Karmani it says: Doing Sa`i in a certain order is not an essential condition, according to our view; even if he begins at Al-Marwah and comes to As-Safa, that is acceptable and he may count it, but it is disliked because he did not do what is Sunnah. Therefore, it is recommended for him to repeat that lap.\xa0\nAs-Saruji (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Ghayah: There is no basis for what Al-Karmani said:\xa0\nAr-Razi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Ahkam Al-Quran: If he begins with Al-Marwah before As-Safa, that is not to be counted according to the well-known report from our companions. It was narrated from Abu Hanifah that he should repeat that lap, but if he does not do so there is no blame on him. He regarded it as being like failing to follow the proper order of washing the limbs when purifying oneself. End quote.\xa0\nWith regard to As-Saruji’s comment that there is no basis for what Al-Karmani said, that is subject to further discussion. End quote from Ar-Razi.\xa0\nThe evidence quoted by the majority for it being essential to do Sa`i in the proper order is the fact that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did that and said: “I begin with that with which Allah began.” According to a report narrated by An-Nasa’i he said: “Begin with that with which Allah began,” in the form of a command or instruction. Moreover, he said: “Learn from me your rituals of Hajj.” So we must learn from him and follow him with regard to our rituals, and begin with that with which Allah began, and following that which he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did, acting in accordance with the Holy Qur’an.” (Adwa’ Al-Bayan, 5/250-251)\xa0\nThe scholars of the Standing Committee said – in response to a question about someone who began with Al-Marwah instead of As-Safa, and added an eighth lap:\xa0\n“If the matter is as you describe, that you did an eighth lap to complete the seven laps of Sa`i in the correct order, then your Sa`i is valid, because the first lap that you did, beginning at Al-Marwah and ending at As-Safa, is regarded as invalid, as you did not do it in the prescribed manner.” (Shaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn `Abdullah ibn Baz, Shaykh `Abd Ar-Razzaq `Afifi, Shaykh `Abdullah ibn Ghadyan, Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah lil-Buhuth Al-`Ilmiyyah wal-Ifta’, 11/259- 260)\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/209165/what-to-do-if-you-start-sai-from-al-marwah
483142,"I can recite well from al-Baqarah to al-An‘am in approximately one and a half hours, and that is 8 juz’. In other words, I can complete the entire Quran by repeating this portion four times, that is, in only five hours. What is the ruling on that? What is the ruling on doing this in Ramadan instead of doing a complete khatm? Will I get the same reward?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly: We congratulate you on what you are doing of good by constantly reciting Quran, and you should carry on with that, because the religious texts speak of the great virtue of doing that.\nIt was narrated from ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ood (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever recites a letter of the Book of Allah will have one good deed recorded for him, and the good deed brings a tenfold reward. I do not say that alif-lam-mim is a letter; rather alif is a letter, lam is a letter and mim is a letter.” At-Tirmidhi (2910); classed as sahih by al-Albani.\nThis reward is attained by everyone who reads or recites any surah of the Quran, whether he recites it as part of a khatm in the correct order, or in his prayer, or in any kind of recitation, without paying attention to any particular khatm.\nBut repeating what you have memorized from al-Baqarah to al-An‘am is not regarded as a real khatm of the Quran, even though you will attain reward for reciting Quran. So strive to recite what you recite well from memory, then complete the rest by reading from the Mushaf.\nThe practice of the early generations (the salaf) was to complete the entire Quran, then go back to the beginning and start again, and so on.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is disliked (makruh) to take too long in completing the Quran and to take more than forty days to complete it.\nAhmad said: What I mostly heard is that the Quran should be completed within forty days.\nThat is because taking longer than that will lead to forgetting the Quran and becoming negligent about it. Therefore what we have mentioned is more appropriate.\nThis applies if there is no excuse. If there is an excuse, then the matter is flexible.\xa0 End quote from al-Mughni (2/611).\nSecondly: you should understand that the best of guidance is the guidance of Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). He has told us the timeframe for completing the Quran, and one should not go beyond that.\nIt was narrated from ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to him: “Read the Quran in a month.” I said: I can do more than that… Until he said: “Read it in seven days, and do not do more than that.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (4767).\nHe also forbade them to complete it in less than three days. It was narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The one who reads the Quran in less than three days will not understand it.” Narrated by Abu Dawud (1394); classed as sahih by al-Albani.\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: What is the longest timeframe for completing the Quran?\nHe replied: There is no set timeframe for that, and the best one can do in that regard is what the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) explained to ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘As when he asked him about how to read the Quran. ‘Abdullah told him that he completed the Quran every day and fasted all the time, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) told him to fast and not fast, and to sleep and pray qiyam, and to complete the Quran every month. He said: “Your own self has a right over you, your wife has a right over you, and your guest has a right over you, so give each of them his or her due.” ‘Abdullah asked for more, and in the end, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) told him to read it in a week, as he said: “Read it every week,” meaning every seven days.\nSo the best timeframe to complete the Quran is seven days, and if a person takes longer to do it, there is nothing wrong with that. So it may be completed in a month, or in twenty days, or more than that. The minimum time frame for completing it is three days, as it says in the hadith “The one who reads the Quran in less than three days will not understand it,” or however the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said it. End quote from the Shaykh’s website.\nWe have previously given a detailed answer regarding this matter; please see question no. 156299.\nThirdly:\nCompleting 8 juz’ in an hour and a half means that each juz’ is completed in 11 minutes, which is a very short time to recite an entire juz’ of the Quran. It is barely possible for a person to recite in a proper manner in this time, and to recite it as it should be recited, let alone understand what he is reciting and reflect on it.\nThe early generations disallowed reciting Quran quickly, if that will lead to mispronouncing the words or will not give any opportunity for reflection. It was narrated that Ibn Mas‘ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Do not recite the Quran rapidly as you recite poetry, and do not utter its words carelessly in the manner of handling poor quality dates. Rather, pause to reflect on its wonders and let your heart be moved by it. The main focus of one of you should not be merely to reach the end of the surah. Al-Bayhaqi: Shu‘ab al-Iman (1883).\nIt was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: There was a time in our lives when one of us would learn about faith before learning about the Quran, and a surah would be revealed to Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and he would learn what it permitted and what it prohibited, and where one should pause to reflect and understand, as you learn the Quran. Then he said: I have seen some men, one of whom starts to recite Quran, and he recites it from al-Fatihah to the end without realising what it enjoins and what it prohibits, or where he should pause and reflect, and the way in which he recites it is (careless) like one who is handling poor quality dates. Narrated by al-Hakim in al-Mustadrak (1/35); he said: It is a sahih hadith according to the conditions of al-Bukhari and Muslim, and I am not aware of any problem with the hadith. And adh-Dhahabi agreed with him.\nReciting the Quran with speed is described by the scholars as qira’at al-hadr.\nOne of the conditions of qira’at al-hadr is that it should not lead to mispronunciation. Qira’at al-hadr means reciting one word after another in rapid succession, whilst paying attention to grammar and the correct pronunciation, and pronouncing the letters clearly. See: al-Itqan fi ‘Ulum al-Quran (1/345).\nReciting a juz’ in ten minutes does not allow one to pronounce words correctly or pay attention to grammar; rather it is reciting at such speed that it is not possible to follow the meaning.\nWhat was narrated from ‘Uthman ibn ‘Affan (may Allah be pleased with him), that he recited the entire Quran in a rak‘ah, is not a precedent to be followed by others; rather it is something unique to ‘Uthman. We are not like him, and what he was enabled to do is something that we cannot be enabled to do. If it is said that this is a karamah (miracle or extraordinary feat) with which he was honoured, that would not be far-fetched, but most of the Sahabah used to recite the Quran in seven days.\nAl-Hafiz al-‘Iraqi said: The Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) used to complete the Quran every seven days… Among those who completed it every seven days were: Tamim ad-Dari, ‘Abd ar-Rahman ibn Yazid, Ibrahim an-Nakha‘i, ‘Urwah ibn az-Zubayr, Abu Mijlaz, Ahmad ibn Hanbal, and the wife of Ibn Mas‘ud. Masruq regarded that as something good. Among those who would complete it in eight days were Ubay and Abu Qilabah. Among those who would complete it in six days was al-Aswad ibn Yazid. Among those who would complete it in five days was ‘Ilqimah ibn Qays. Among those who would complete it in three days was Ibn Mas‘ud. And he said that the one who recites it in less than three days is reciting at speed.

7268,"DuringHajj, is it permissible to use an umbrella that covers the head and protects the body from the heat of the sun? This umbrella is however held by supports from the shoulder leaving the two hands free.","[""Praise be to Allah.Is it permissible for men to cover their head in Ihram?\nThe scholars agree that covering the head is prohibited for a man in Ihram . This is indicated by the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) concerning a man who died in `Arafah when he was in Ihram: “Wash him with water and lotus leaves, and shroud him in two cloths, and do not put any perfume on him or cover his head, for Allah will resurrect him on the Day of Resurrection reciting the Talbiyah.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 1267; Muslim, 1206)\nAl-Bukhari (1542) and Muslim (1177) narrated from `Abdullah ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that a man said, “O Messenger of Allah, what garments should the Muhrim (a person in the state of Ihram) wear?” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “He should not wear a shirt, or a turban, or pants, or a burnoose or Khifaf (leather socks).” The burnoose is a garment worn by the people of the Maghreb (North Africa) which has a hood attached.\xa0\nTypes of covering the head in Ihram\nThe Muhrim’s covering his head is of various kinds:\xa0\n\nCovering it with something that stays on the head , such as a hat or turban and the like. This is prohibited. The evidence for it being prohibited is the two Hadith quoted above.\xa0\nCovering his head with something that does not touch or stay above it, such as an umbrella, tent, car roof etc. There is nothing wrong with this, because Umm Husayn (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “I performed Hajj with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) during the Farewell Pilgrimage, and I saw him when he stoned Jamarat Al-`Aqabah and went away on his mount, accompanied by Bilal and Usamah. One of them was leading his mount and the other was holding his garment over the head of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), shading him from the sun. (Narrated by Muslim, 1298)\n\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“This indicates that it is permissible for the Muhrim to shade his head with a cloth or whatever. This is our view and the view of the majority of scholars.”\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “This is exactly like an umbrella.”\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “There is nothing wrong with the Muhrim using an umbrella to shield himself from the sun, or shading himself in a tent or under the roof of a car.” (Fatawa Ibn Baz, 17/115)\xa0\n\nCarrying one’s luggage on one's head. There is nothing wrong with this because it is usually not done with the intention of covering the head. If it is done with that intention then it is prohibited.\xa0\n\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Carrying luggage is not covering the head, it is like the Muhrim carrying food and the like, so long as he is not doing that as a trick (to get around the ruling), because Allah has forbidden His slaves to use trickery in order to do things that He has forbidden.” (Fatawa Ibn Baz, 17/115)\xa0\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 11356 , 175014 , 227097 , and 41140 .\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/7268/can-you-use-an-umbrella-in-ihram
