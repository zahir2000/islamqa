217852,What is the Islamic view regarding a woman buying and selling during Jumu‘ah prayer?,"['Praise be to Allah.It is permissible for a woman to buy and sell during Jumu‘ah prayer, because she is not obliged to attend the prayer. That is on condition that the one who buys from her or sells to her is someone who is also not obliged to attend Jumu‘ah prayer, such as a woman, a minor or a traveller.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIt is prohibited to buy and sell, and it is obligatory to attend the prayer for those who are obliged to pray Jumu‘ah. In the case of others, such as women, minors and travellers, they are not subject to this prohibition, because Allah, may He be exalted, only forbade buying and selling to those whom He commanded to attend Jumu‘ah prayer. The prohibition does not apply to those who are not required to attend, and the reason for the prohibition is made clear; it is because of what would result from buying and selling of being distracted and prevented from attending Jumu‘ah prayer, and that is not applicable in their case.\nIf one of the parties to the transaction is obliged to attend Jumu‘ah and the other is not, then it is haram for the one who is obliged to attend and it is disliked (makruh) for the other party, because of what it involves of helping in sin.\nIt may even be that it is haram because Allah says: {do not cooperate in sin and transgression} [al-Ma’idah 5:2].\nAl-Mughni (2/73).\nWhat Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said about the possibility of it being haram if there is a transaction between two people, one of whom is obliged to attend Jumu‘ah and the other is not obliged, is a strong view that carries weight, because of the apparent meaning of the verse that he quoted. It is the view of many of the scholars (may Allah have mercy on them).\nJalal ad-Din al-Mahalli (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf two people engage in a transaction, one of whom is obliged to attend Jumu‘ah and the other is not, the other one is also sinning, because he is helping in something that is haram.""(Sharh al-Muhalli ‘ala Minhaj at-Talibin\xa0 1/335).\nIt says in al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (9/228): If Jumu‘ah is obligatory for one of them and not the other, then the view of the majority of Hanafis and Shafa‘is is that they are both sinning, because the first one, who was obliged to attend Jumu‘ah, has committed something that is prohibited, and the other one who is not obliged to attend, helped him in that.

238718,"If a man kept his marriage to his second wife secret, and had children with her, then he died without having disclosed this secret to his parents and siblings, or to his first wife and her children, then how can the second wife and her children seek their rightful share of the estate?","['Praise be to Allah.In a number of questions we have stated that it is obligatory to officially register marriages, because that will protect people’s rights so that they will not be lost.\nPlease see the answer to question no. 129851 .\nBut a man may be forced to forego registering a marriage because he lives in a western country where plural marriage is not allowed and the one who does that will be penalised. In that case, we may say:\nIf the husband married a second wife in accordance with Islamic teachings, then it is easy for the second wife and her children to prove that, because when she got married there must have been her guardian and two men – at least – who acted as witnesses or he must have announced the marriage to some of his friends or relatives.\nThe husband may have left behind something in his handwriting confirming this second marriage, or he may have registered his children from his second wife in his name, and so on.\nSo the second wife should take some of these witnesses and whatever proof or other circumstantial evidence she has to prove the validity of her claim, and present it to those in charge of the Islamic centre in her city, and they can present it to the family of the deceased and prove to them that there are other parties who have rights in this regard, and they are entitled to their share of the estate.\nThe first wife of the deceased and her children must accept that, and beware of cutting off ties of kinship and refuse to give what rightfully belongs to their brothers, because Allah has ordained that all wives and all children have rights to the estate, so there should be no differentiation between one wife and another, or between one son and another. They are all children of the deceased and are all entitled to their share of the inheritance. The prohibition [on denying them their rights] is further emphasized if any of the heirs are minors (orphans), because devouring the wealth of orphans is a major sin for which the one who does that deserves punishment in hell.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Indeed, those who devour the property of orphans unjustly are only consuming into their bellies fire. And they will be burned in a Blaze}\xa0[an-Nisa’ 4:10].\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/238718/how-can-the-second-wife-prove-her-marriage-after-her-husband-dies-as-the-marriage-was-not-officially-registered
