222944,"In the mosques, we see many people reading Quran with the Mushaf on their thigh or knee whilst they are sitting. Is that permissible?","['Praise be to Allah.Venerating and respecting the Book of Allah, may He be exalted, is part of faith, and subjecting it to disrespect and mishandling is undoubtedly prohibited.\nBut there is nothing wrong with the reader placing the Mushaf on his thigh or knee whilst reading, and it does not seem that there is any kind of disrespect towards the Book of Allah in doing that. Rather it may be that this is easier for some readers, and is more comfortable for them when reading, especially if they are reading for a long time.\nBut in that case he must be careful not to let the Mushaf fall onto his foot or on the ground.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIt is permissible for a person to put the Mushaf in a pocket on his chest or on his side, but if he puts it in a pocket that is on his side, he should take care when sitting, so that it will not be near his posterior, meaning that he should put it on his thigh.""(Liqa’ al-Bab al-Maftuh\xa0 168/10).\nThus the shaykh indicated that there is nothing wrong with putting the Mushaf on one’s thigh.\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) was also asked about putting the Mushaf in one’s lap when reading Quran : is that contrary to proper etiquette? He replied: No.\nFor more information, please see the answers to questions no. 95753 and 95753 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/222944/is-it-permissible-to-put-the-mushaf-on-ones-thigh-or-knee-when-reading-from-it
223445,"I was unaware of the Islamic rulings when I went in to have a vasectomy. What should I do now? In other words, what are the guidelines?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly: it is not permissible for a man or woman to undergo any surgical or other procedure that will permanently prevent them from having children.\nOne of these means that is forbidden is vasectomy, which is a surgical procedure in which the vas deferens (the two channels through which sperm travels to the bladder and then to the penis) is cut.\nIt says in a statement of the Islamic Fiqh Council: It is haram to permanently remove the ability to produce offspring for a man or a woman, which is what is known as sterilization, so long as there is no necessary reason, according to Islamic standards, for doing that.\nThis has been explained previously in the answers to questions no. 111969 and 47196 .\nSecondly: With regard to reversing the vasectomy, this is a matter concerning which one must refer to medical specialists. If the doctors determine that there is no harm that would result from that, then you must undergo this procedure and restore the vas deferens to its natural state.\nBut if that is not possible, or it will result in harm, then you do not have to do anything, because harm cannot be removed by further harm.\nAs you did that as a result of ignorance of the ruling, then Allah, may He be exalted, will pardon you and there is no sin on you. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {And there is no blame upon you for that in which you have erred but [only for] what your hearts intended} [al-Ahzaab 33:5].\nAnd you did not deliberately intend to commit sin.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/223445/ruling-on-vasectomy-and-reversal-thereof
