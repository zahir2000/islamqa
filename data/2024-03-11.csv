351838,It's a fact that only Allah know the unseen but I'm a little bit confused regarding the fact that some people see stuff happening in there dreams which comes true later or some people seeing jannah in there dreams and hell and etc,"['Praise be to Allah.No one knows the true unseen except Allah, may He be exalted, but He may disclose to some of His slaves some matters of the unseen, either through the angel, or through a true dream, or through inspiration, or by speaking directly to him.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{He knows what is [presently] before them and what will be after them, and they encompass not a thing of His knowledge except for what He wills}\xa0[Al-Baqarah 2:255]\n{[He is] Knower of the unseen, and He does not disclose His [knowledge of the] unseen to anyone,\nExcept whom He has approved of messengers}\xa0[Al-Jinn 72:26-27].\n-1-\nPart of the unseen of which Allah informed His prophets through the angel is knowledge of what will happen of the portents of the Hour; the description of the gathering, the reckoning and the sirat (bridge over Hell); and many of the details of Paradise and Hell.\n-2-\nPart of the unseen of which Allah informs His slaves through a true dream is when a person sees what is going to happen to him or to someone else in the future, then it happens as he saw it. So he may see that So-and-so is going to die, or that he is going to get married to So-and-so, or that he will have a child, and the like.\nThis is part of the unseen which Allah discloses to some of His slaves. Hence true dreams are a part of prophecy.\nAl-Bukhari (6989) narrated from Abu Sa‘id al-Khudri that he heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “True dreams are one of the forty-six parts of prophecy.”\nMuslim (8) also narrated it from Abu Hurayrah.\nWhat is meant by true dreams being one of the parts of prophecy is that the word nubuwwah (prophecy, prophethood) is taken from the words naba’ and ianba’, which refer to informing. What is meant is that the dream is true foretelling from Allah, and there is no lie in it. Similarly, the word nubuwwah refers to true foretelling from Allah, Who cannot lie. Hence dreams are similar to prophecy in the sense that what is foretold about the unseen is true.""(Sharh Sahih al-Bukhari by Ibn Battal\xa0 9/517).\nSo if someone sees in his dream something of the future unseen, then it comes to pass as he saw it, this means that Allah has blessed him with knowing something of the unseen that no one knows except Him, may He be glorified, and He has told us that He may disclose it to some of His slaves.\n-3-\nAllah may inform His slave of some matter of the unseen by means of inspiration, as al-Bukhari (3469) and Muslim (2398) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Among the nations that came before you there were men who were inspired. If there are any among my ummah who are inspired, then ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab is among them.”\nAccording to a mu‘allaq report narrated by al-Bukhari (3689), “Among those of the Children of Israel who came before you there were some men who were spoken to without them being prophets; if there is anyone among my ummah who could be one of them, it is ‘Umar.”\nAl-Khattabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “if there is anyone among my ummah who could be one of them, it is ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him)” – the one who is inspired is the one into whose heart something is cast, so it is as if he is told about it; something occurs to him and it happens to him, or something crosses his mind and it comes to pass. This is a high status of the awliya’ (those friends of llah) and a lofty status among those who are brought close to Allah.""(\xa0A‘lam al-Hadith\xa0 3/1571).\nAn example of that is when Allah inspired the mother of Musa (peace be upon him): Throw him into the river; he will be saved and will be one of the messengers. Allah called this inspiration wahy, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And We inspired [wa awhayna] to the mother of Moses, “Suckle him; but when you fear for him, cast him into the river and do not fear and do not grieve. Indeed, We will return him to you and will make him [one] of the messengers”}\xa0[al-Qasas 28:7].\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This wahy (inspiration) is for people other than the prophets; it may happen when they are awake or when they are asleep, and it may happen with an audible voice or a voice that is in the person’s heart, not coming from outside himself, when awake or when asleep.(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa\xa012/398).\n-4-\nAllah may inform His Messenger about the unseen by speaking to him directly, as happened to a number of the prophets, including our Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on the night of the Mi‘raj (ascent to heaven).\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{ And it is not for any human being that Allah should speak to him except by revelation or from behind a partition or that He sends a messenger to reveal, by His permission, what He wills. Indeed, He is Most High and Wise}\xa0[Ash-Shura 42:51].\nThese are four ways in which Allah may inform some of His slaves about the unseen, one of which is dreams. So a person may see something of the future, then it comes to pass as he saw it, or Allah may cause him to see Paradise or Hell.\nAt the end of time, true dreams will increase and will bring some glad tidings, and the truthfulness of the dreams will be indicative of the sincerity of the one who sees the dream, as Ahmad (10590), Abu Dawud (5019), at-Tirmidhi (2270), and Ibn Majah (3917) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), who said: “Towards the end of time, a Muslim’s dream will hardly be false and the truest of them in dreams will be the truest of them in speech. The dream of the Muslim is one of the forty-six parts of prophecy.” And he said: “Dreams are of three types: good dreams, which are glad tidings from Allah; another type of dream, which comes from the Shaytan and is intended to make him sad; and dreams that come from what a person is thinking of to himself. If one of you sees something that he dislikes, let him not tell anyone about it, and let him get up and pray.”\nClassed as sahih by al-Albani and Shu‘ayb al-Arna’ut, who said: [Sahih] according to the conditions of al-Bukhari and Muslim.\nMay Allah grant us and you true dreams.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/351838/does-seeing-matters-of-the-unseen-in-a-dream-contradict-the-fact-that-only-allah-knows-the-unseen
118350,"In our country, there are mosques where they delay Jumu`ah prayer until almost the time for `Asr. Is it permissible to pray Jumu`ah in these mosques?","['Praise be to Allah.How long does Jumu`ah last?\nThe time for Jumu`ah lasts until the time for `Asr begins, according to the majority of scholars. If the people pray Jumu`ah before the time for `Asr begins, then they have caught up with Jumu`ah.\xa0(Al-Majmu`, 4/377-381, Al-Muhalla, 5/42-45)\xa0\nIt is better to pray Jumu`ah with those who offer the prayer at the beginning of its time , because that is in accordance with the Sunnah of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).\xa0\nSalamah ibn Al-Akwa` (may Allah be pleased with him) said: We used to pray Jumu`ah with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when the sun passed its zenith . (Narrated by Al-Bukhaari, 4168 and Muslim, 860) \xa0\nIt is prohibited to delay Jumu`ah until the time for it is over; that is a major sin, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Verily, the prayer is enjoined on the believers at fixed times.” [Al-Nisa’ 4:103]\xa0\n“Then, there has succeeded them a posterity who have given up the prayers [i.e. made their prayers to be lost, either by not offering them or by not offering them perfectly or by not offering them in their proper fixed times] and have followed lusts. So they will be thrown in Hell.” [Maryam 19:59]\nIs it permissible to delay Jumu`ah prayer?\xa0\nThe scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas were asked about people who are studying in the US, and the study program does not allow any time for prayer. The time for Jumu`ah prayer in the US is 1.30 p.m., but they are forced to delay it until 4 p.m. because of the study program. Is it permissible to delay Jumu`ah until this time?\xa0\nThey replied:\xa0\n“It is not permissible to delay the five prayers for which the Wise Lawgiver (Allah) has stipulated specific times. If the delay in prayer is for a reason which will not cause one to miss its prescribed time, then it is permissible to delay it; if it will cause one to miss the time, it is prohibited. If continuing to study means that the prayer will be done outside of the proper time, then it is not permissible for the student to do that, and he must offer the prayer on time. The end of the time for Jumu`ah is the end of the time for Dhuhr, so it is not permissible to delay it under any circumstances.”\xa0 (Shaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn `Abdullah ibn Baz, Shaykh `Abd Al-Razzaq `Afifi, Shaykh `Abdullah ibn Qa`ud, Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 8/197)\xa0\nTo sum up, it is permissible to delay Jumu`ah prayer until close to the time for `Asr, in such a way that it will end before the time for `Asr begins, but if there is more than one Jumu`ah in the town, it is better to pray with those who pray Jumu`ah when the time for it begins.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/118350/how-late-can-you-pray-jumuah
150534,"If the father appoints a proxy to give his daughter in marriage, what should the proxy say to the groom when doing the marriage contract? If he says, “I give to you in marriage the woman on behalf of whom I am acting as a proxy” out of ignorance, is that valid? What is the correct phrase?","['Praise be to Allah.If the father appoints a proxy to give his daughter in marriage, then this proxy should say words to indicate that he is acting as a proxy of the guardian in this marriage, such as saying “I give to you in marriage So-and-so the daughter of So-and-so, who has appointed me as his proxy to give her in marriage” or, “I give to you in marriage So-and-so the daughter of the one who has appointed me as his proxy,” and similar phrases.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf the guardian has appointed a proxy, what the proxy should not say, for example, is, “I give to you in marriage my daughter.” Rather he should explain that he is a proxy, so he should say, “I give to you in marriage the daughter of So-and-so, who appointed me as his proxy, and she is So-and-so the daughter of So-and-so” or, “I give to you in marriage as a proxy the daughter of So-and-so the son of So-and-so.”\nIf he says: “I give to you in marriage the daughter of So-and-so,” that is not valid, because he has no guardianship over her, unless he explains the reason why he is giving the daughter of So-and-so in marriage, which is because he is his (the guardian’s) proxy.""(Ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘\xa0 12/23).\nShaykh Ibn Jibrin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIt is valid for the groom to appoint a proxy, and for the woman’s guardian to do so. Therefore if the groom is far away, he can send word appointing you as his proxy, and say: “You are my proxy in my marrying the daughter of So-and-so, so you should be present.” And the guardian of the girl may say: “I give my daughter in marriage to So-and-so, who has appointed you as his proxy.” And you may say: “I accept on behalf of So-and-so, who appointed me as his proxy.” That is valid.\nSimilarly, the guardian may appoint you as his proxy, so for example you may say to the groom: “I give to you in marriage the daughter of the one who appointed me as his proxy, So-and-so the daughter of So-and-so,” and he may say, “I accept.”(Sharh Akhsar al-Mukhtasrat).\nAs for the proxy of the guardian saying: “I give to you in marriage the woman on behalf of whom I am acting as a proxy,” this wording is not correct, because the woman has no right to do the marriage contract herself, or to appoint someone to do the marriage contract for her.\nRather her guardian should do the marriage contract for her on the basis of his having guardianship over her, not on the basis that he is acting as a proxy for her.\nBut usually people do not differentiate between these words, and do not pay attention to the difference in meaning or what they indicate.\nTherefore what appears to be the case is that the marriage that was done with these words is valid, on the grounds of the intention of the guardian’s proxy, as he meant that he was the proxy of the guardian, not the proxy of the woman.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/150534/what-should-the-proxy-of-the-womans-guardian-say-when-doing-the-marriage-contract
50404,"A girl noticed some thin discharge on her underwear but she had not felt it come out. Is it permissible for her to pray with her underwear on which this discharge has gotten? If it is not permissible, then does she have to repeat her Wudu and change her underwear?","['Praise be to Allah.The discussion on such discharges focuses on two issues:\xa0\nAre discharges pure or impure?\xa0\nThe view of Abu Hanifah and Ahmad, and one of the two views narrated from Ash-Shafi`i – which An-Nawawi classed as correct – is that it is pure. This view was also favoured by Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin, who said in Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti` (1/392):\xa0\n“If these discharges come as the result of intimacy, then they are pure, because they are not the waste products of eating and drinking, thus they are not urine.\xa0\nThe basic principle is that there is no impurity unless there is evidence that something is impure. Because a man is not obliged to wash his penis if he has intercourse with his wife nor to wash his garment if anything gets onto it; if it were impure then the semen, which is pure, would become impure (through contamination with these discharges).\xa0(See Al-Majmu`, 1/406 and Al-Mughni, 2/88)\xa0\nBased on this, she does not have to wash her underwear or change them if these discharges get on them.\xa0\nIs Wudu invalidated because of discharges or not?\xa0\nThe view of most of the scholars is that this does invalidate Wudu.\xa0This is the view favoured by Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him), who said:\xa0\n“Anyone who attributes to me the view that this does not invalidate Wudu is not correct. It seems that he understood from my words that it is pure and does not invalidate Wudu.” (Majmu` Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin, 11/287)\xa0\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) also said (11/285):\xa0\nWith regard to the belief of some women, that (these discharges) do not invalidate Wudu , I do not know of any basis for that except the view of Ibn Hazm.\xa0\nBut, if a woman experiences this wetness constantly, then she should do Wudu for every prayer after the time for the prayer begins, and it will not matter if this wetness is discharged after that, even if that happens while she is praying.\xa0\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“If the wetness described happens continually , most of the time, then every woman who experiences that must do Wudu for every prayer when the time begins. This is similar to the case of a woman who suffers from Istihadah (irregular vaginal bleeding outside menses) or one who suffers from urinary incontinence . \xa0\nBut if this wetness only happens sometimes, and is not ongoing, then it comes under the same rulings as urine – when it happens it invalidates purity, even during the prayer.” (Majmu` Fatawa Ibn Baz, 10/130) \xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/50404/can-you-pray-with-discharge-on-your-underwear
