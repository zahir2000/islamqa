98479,"I want to know about buying gold from an auction for a very cheap price, because some people leave it with the bank as collateral, and when the time [for paying their debt] comes, the bank sells it for much less than its real price. Is buying this gold permissible for me?","['Praise be to Allah.It is permissible to buy gold from an auction subject to two conditions:\n1.\xa0That the purchase is hand-to-hand, which includes certified cheques, which means that the money is moved from the buyer’s account and is deposited in the seller’s account immediately. Please see question no. 2711 .\nThe Islamic Fiqh Council belonging to the Muslim World League issued a statement in its eleventh session in which they said: After studying and discussing the matter, the council unanimously determined the following:\nFirstly: the receipt of the [certified] cheque may be regarded as an exchange on the spot, if certain conditions are met when money is to be transferred between banks.\nSecondly: recording it in the bank’s records comes under the ruling on exchange on the spot for one who wants to exchange one currency for another, whether this exchange is in return for currency that a person gives to the bank, or when the money is already deposited in the bank. End quote.\n2.\xa0The bank’s sale of the collateral should be permissible according to Islamic rulings. What that means is it is only permissible to sell the collateral if the time for payment of the debt has come and the debtor refuses to pay it. So if the borrower gave the lender (the bank) permission to sell the collateral, the matter is clear. If he did not give permission, the authorities or judge should force him to sell, and if he does not do that, then the authorities should sell the collateral and pay the lender what is due to him. In that case, the authorities may appoint a proxy to handle the sale, whether the proxy is the lender or someone else.\nIt says in Zad al-Mustaqni‘: When the debt becomes due and the borrower refuses to pay, if the borrower gave permission to the lender to sell (the collateral), he should sell it and pay the debt, otherwise the authorities should force him to pay up or sell the collateral. If he does not do that, the authorities should sell the collateral and pay off the debt. End quote.\nIf the system in that country gives permission to the bank to sell collateral when the debt becomes due and the borrower does not pay it, then this is like permission from the authorities or the judge.\nBut that is subject to the condition that whoever sells the collateral, whether it is the bank or someone appointed by the judge, should sell it at the regular price, not for less than that.\nIt says in Mughni al-Muhtaj (3/71): The person with whom the collateral is kept should not sell it except for the regular price in the local currency, with the exchange taking place on the spot; he is like a proxy, so he should not sell it for a lower price. If he fails to pay attention to any of these conditions, the sale is not valid, but it does not matter if the price is a little lower than the regular price, in a manner that people usually agree on through bargaining, because people usually tolerate that.\nThus you will realise that it is not permissible for the bank to sell the gold for much less than its regular price, and it is not permissible to buy it from the bank [for such a low price], because this transaction is not valid, as explained above, and because it is consuming the borrower’s wealth unlawfully.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/98479/if-the-bank-sells-gold-by-auction-that-it-is-keeping-as-collateral-is-it-permissible-to-buy-it
149276,Is it permissible for me to recite Du`as (supplications) from the book Abwab Al-Faraj by Muhammad `Alawi Al-Hasani Al-Maliki? Are there any Du`as narrated from the Messenger for relief from worry and stress?,"['Praise be to Allah.Reciting Du`a from the book of Abwab Al-Faraj\nWe have not read the book Abwab Al-Faraj in its entirety, but we have come across some paragraphs of it which contained innovated prayers such as Salat Al-fatih ”, “As-Salah An-Nariyyah ”, “As-Salah Al-Munjiyah” and others which contain odd phrases and blameworthy exaggeration.\xa0\nDu`a for anxiety and stress\nWith regard to Du`as for relief from worry and stress , they include:\xa0\n\nThat which was narrated by Ahmad (3528) from `Abdullah ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “No person suffers any anxiety or grief, and says: `Allahumma inni `abduka wa ibn `abdika wa ibn amatika, nasiyati bi yadika, madin fiyya hukmuka, `adlun fiyya qada’uka, as’aluka bi kulli ismin huwa laka sammayta bihi nafsaka aw anzaltahu fi kitabika aw `allamtahu ahadan min khalqika aw ista’tharta bihi fi `ilm il-ghaybi `andak an taj`ala Al-Qur’ana rabi` qalbi wa nur sadri wa jala’a huzni wa dhahaba hammi (O Allah, I am Your slave, son of Your slave, son of Your female slave, my forelock is in Your hand, Your command over me is forever executed and Your decree over me is just. I ask You by every Name belonging to You which You named Yourself with, or revealed in Your Book, or You taught to any of Your creation, or You have preserved in the knowledge of the unseen with You, that You make the Quran the life of my heart and the light of my breast, and a departure for my sorrow and a release for my anxiety)` but Allah will take away his sorrow and grief, and give him in their stead joy.” It was said: O Messenger of Allah, should we not learn them (these words)? He (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: Yes indeed; whoever hears them should learn them.”\xa0 (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in As-Silsilah As-Sahihah, 199)\nThat which was narrated by Abu Dawud (5090) and Ahmad (27898) from Abu Bakrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The Du`a of the person who is in distress is : `Allahumma rahmataka arju fa la takilni ila nafsi tarfat `ayn wa aslih li sha’ni kullahu la ilaha illa anta (O Allah, for Your mercy I hope, so do not leave me in charge of my affairs even for the blink of an eye; rectify all my affairs.

At-Tabari said: The early generations used to offer this supplication and they called it Du`a Al-karb (the supplication of distress ). If it is said that this is dhikr (remembrance of Allah) and there is no supplication in it, that may be answered in two well-known points: (i) that the supplication may begin with this dhikr, then one may offer supplication as one wishes; (ii) the response of Sufyan ibn `Uyaynah who said: Do you not know the words of Allah, may He be Exalted [stated in a Qudsi Hadith]: “Whoever is distracted by remembrance of Me from asking of Me, I shall give him the best of that which I give to those who ask .” The poet said: If a man praises you, then that is enough and there is no need for him for state that he needs help [because his praise of you is a signal that he needs help.”\xa0\nFor more, you can read this booklet “Dealing with Worries.”\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/149276/dua-for-relief-from-anxiety-and-stress
111930,"I am pregnant, and I ask Allah to bless me with a righteous child. I would like to know whether there are any righteous deeds that I can do when I am pregnant?","['Praise be to Allah.Perhaps the most important righteous deed that a pregnant woman can do and pay attention to is learning useful methods of raising children, reading trustworthy books about child-rearing, and listening to specialist people of knowledge who are known to be sincere. That is because giving a child a good upbringing is the most important duty that parents can do for their children, and it cannot be matched by accumulating wealth, buying what they need or anything else, to the extent that a wise person said:\nThe best thing that parents can leave for their children is a praiseworthy attitude, good manners and righteous friends.\nThis was quoted by Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr in Bahjat al-Majalis (p. 18). Something similar was also narrated in a mursal hadith. See: al-Silsilah al-Da‘ifah (no. 1121).\nNo one should think that instilling good manners and a good attitude is something easy; rather this refers to a set of manners and attitudes that a person cannot attain except through experience, care and discipline. If the parents rely on the child learning about good manners and good attitudes by himself, then they are being careless and negligent towards their children.\nAl-Mawardi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nYou should understand that the child is born with some characteristics and manners, so the praiseworthy and pleasing characteristics need to be polished and refined, because the praiseworthy characteristics have opposites which could be strengthened through whims and desires. If the parent fails to discipline the child and leaves the development of manners and attitudes to the child’s reason, in the hope that he will naturally adhere to good characteristics and manners, and he gives up striving, he will end up a remorseful loser and the child will grow up with no manners or discipline, behaving like ignorant people. That is because good manners are acquired through experience or learned from customs that are regarded as good, and each community will vary in that regard. That is not something that can be attained through reason or letting the child behave according to his nature so that he can learn through experience and pain. And it cannot be learned through experience in dealing with others, then letting the child’s reason decide about these issues. If reason were sufficient to learn about good manners and attitudes, then the Prophets of Allah, may He be exalted, would have had no need for revealed texts, and it would have been sufficient for them to rely on their reason. It was narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that he said: “I have been sent to perfect noble characteristics.”(Adab al-Dunya wa’l-Din\xa0 p. 286).\nThat – undoubtedly – is what is referred to in the verse in which Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{O you who have believed, protect yourselves and your families from a Fire whose fuel is people and stones}[Al-Tahrim 66:6].\nIf parents had sufficient awareness of this matter, and they realised how serious the issue of raising a child, disciplining him and teaching him good manners is, the entire condition of the ummah could be changed completely and would become better and more sound, by Allah’s leave.\nWe also advise the pregnant woman to adhere to religious duties, uphold regular prayer, and offer a great deal of supplication, asking Allah, may He be exalted, for a righteous child who honours his parents and for well-being in this world and the hereafter, for no one is ever given anything better than well-being. We do not know of any particular act of worship that is recommended in Islamic teachings specifically for the pregnant woman and not for others.\nYou can learn a lot from the book Mas’uliyat al-Ab al-Muslim nahwa al-Walad fi Marhalat al-Tufulah by ‘Adnan Salih Baharith.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/111930/are-there-righteous-deeds-that-a-pregnant-woman-in-particular-can-do
231261,"I am living here in the West. I was wondering what is the extent that [something is pure until proven that it is prohibited] with respect to food, clothing and soap?","['Praise be to Allah.Everything Is Permissible in Islam Until Proven Prohibited\nThe scholars set a rule that says that in principle everything is permissible, and they based this rule on Shar`i evidence.\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“It should be understood that in principle all things, of various types and categories, are generally permissible for human beings, and that they are pure and it is not forbidden for people to handle them and touch them. This is a comprehensive rule that is general in application, and it is an important ruling that is of immense benefit and brings much blessing, and the scholars turned to it when issuing ruling on innumerable actions and issues faced by people. It is based on ten points of evidence – from what I can call to mind of sources of shari‘ah – namely: the Book of Allah, the Sunnah of His Messenger, and following the path of the believers that is mentioned in the verses (interpretation of the meaning): “Obey Allah and obey the Messenger (Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)), and those of you (Muslims) who are in authority” [An-Nisa’ 4:59] and “Verily, your Walee (Protector or Helper) is Allah, His Messenger, and the believers” [Al-Ma’idah 5:55]; in addition to analogy, giving the same rulings to similars situations, rational thinking, and insight.” (Majmu‘ Al-Fatawa, 21/535)\xa0\nThen he (may Allah have mercy on him) quoted the evidence for that, so please refer to the book mentioned above.\nWhat this ruling means is that with regard to everything that is of benefit on earth, and what man may attain thereof and make use of, is permissible so long as there is no evidence to indicate that it is prohibited.\nPermissible and prohibited food and drinks\nWith regard to food , drink, clothing and soap (and cleaning materials), this rule is to be followed with regard to everything except in the presence of Shar`i text that gives a ruling about a certain matter or situation, with the exception of the following:\n\nThings containing any considerably harmful ingredients, because the basic principle with regard to harmful substances is that they are prohibited, and they are not included in the rule that says: “in principle everything is permissible”.\n\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“and do not throw yourselves into destruction.”\xa0[Al-Baqarah 2:195]\n“And do not kill yourselves (nor kill one another). Surely, Allah is Most Merciful to you.”\xa0[An-Nisa’ 4:29]\nAbu Sa‘id Al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There should be neither harming nor reciprocating harm.” Narrated by Al-Hakim (2/57-58). He said: Its chain of narrators is authentic according to the conditions of Muslim. It was also classed as authentic by Al-Albaani in Silsilat Al-Ahaadeeth As-Saheehah (1/498)\nShaykh Muhammad Al-Amin Ash-Shanqiti (may Allah have mercy on him) discussed this issue and said:\n“If it is purely harmful with no benefit at all, then it is prohibited, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There should be neither harming nor reciprocating harm.”\nIf it is beneficial in some ways and harmful in others, then one of three scenarios must apply:\n\nEither the benefit outweighs the harm\nor the converse is true\nor the benefit and harm are equal.\n\nIf the harm outweighs the benefit or is equal to it, then it is not allowed, because of the Hadith, “There should be neither harming nor reciprocating harm,” and because warding off harm takes precedence over achieving interests.\nIf the benefit outweighs the harm, then the most correct view is that it is permissible, because it is a well-established principle that greater benefits take precedence over lesser harms.” (Adwa’ Al-Bayan, 7/793-794)\n\nThe basic principle with regard to meat is that it is prohibited.\n\nThat is because it is not permissible to eat meat unless it is slaughtered in the proper (Islamic) manner, fulfilling all the necessary conditions.\nAl-Khataabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“With regard to anything that is prohibited in principle, it only becomes permissible if it fulfils the necessary conditions and is done in the proper manner, such as intimate relationships, which do not become permissible until after marriage.\xa0\nSimilarly, the meat of sheep does not become permissible unless it is slaughtered in the proper manner. If there is any doubt concerning the fulfilment of these conditions, and whether they were met for certain in the manner that indicates that it has become permissible, then the original principle remains in effect and the meat is prohibited.” (Ma‘alim As-Sunan, 3/57)\nHowever, in order to prove that it is permissible, it is sufficient to know that the one who slaughtered it was a Muslim or one of the People of the Book (a Jew or Christian). After that it is not necessary to ascertain the method of slaughter for each animal.\nBased on that, with regard to meat that is available in a Muslim or Christian country, it is deemed to be permissible, unless it is proven that it was slaughtered in a way that is contrary to Islamic rulings, such as strangling or electric shock, or that the name of Allah was not mentioned over it, and so on.\nWith regard to products for which there is no Shar`i evidence that they are prohibited, or the list of ingredients does not include any components that are prohibited or are harmful, then we rule that it is permissible and pure, and that basic principle is not altered for mere doubts or unproven talk.\nYet, if prohibited ingredients are included in some food , is it prohibited to consume it altogether? This is subject to further detailed discussion, as has been explained in fatwa no.\xa0114129 .\nTo sum up, if the prohibited substance is still present in its original form, then it is prohibited to consume it. However, if it has been transformed into another substance by means of interactions or manufacturing processes, and the first prohibited substance is no longer present in its original form, then the more correct scholarly view is that it is permissible to consume it.\nPermissible and prohibited clothing\xa0\nWith regard to clothing, it comes under the rule that “in principle everything is permissible”. The basic principle concerning it is that it is permissible, except what is excluded by Islamic rulings, such as silk which is prohibited for men, and some animal skins that cannot be purified by means of tanning.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/231261/everything-is-permissible-in-islam-until-proven-prohibited
