330932,Is al-Muqsit (the Most Just) one of the names of Allah? Please give evidence from the Quran and Sunnah.,"['Praise be to Allah.A number of scholars regard al-Muqsit (the Most Just) as one of the names of Allah. The evidence for that – in their view – is the verse (interpretation of the meaning): {And We place the scales of justice [al-qist] for the Day of Resurrection} [al-Anbiya’ 21:47].\nIt was narrated that Abu Musa (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) stood and told us four things: “Allah does not sleep and it is not befitting that He should sleep; He raises the Balance and lowers it…” (Narrated by Muslim, al-Iman, 1/112).\nThose who narrated it include:\nIt was narrated via ‘Abd al-Malik ibn Muhammad as-San`ani and others, including:\n\nal-Khattabi 2. Ibn Mandah 3. Al-Halimi 4. Al-Bayhaqi 5. Al-Asbahani 6. Ibn al-‘Arabi 7. Al-Qurtubi 8. Ibn al-Qayyim 9. Ash-Sharbasi 10. Nur al-Hasan Khan.\n\n(Mu`taqad Ahl as-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah fi Asma’ Allah al-Husna by Muhammad Khalifah at-Tamimi, 251).\nThe author thought it most likely that it is not one of the names of Allah, because it is not mentioned in the Quran as one of His names.\nAmong the contemporary scholars who listed it as one of the beautiful names of Allah was Shaykh Salih Al ash-Shaykh (may Allah preserve him), who said:\n[They also quoted as evidence] the verse (interpretation of the meaning): {and act justly [aqsitu]. Indeed, Allah loves those who act justly} [al-Hujurat 49:9].\n{act justly [aqsitu]} means: Be fair. It is a verb that comes from the root aqsata; the active participle of this verb is muqsit, meaning one who is just. This is in contrast to the verbal root qasata [meaning to act wrongfully], of which the active participle is qasit (pl. qasitun), which refers to those who do wrong and transgress, as in the verse {But as for the unjust [al-qasitun], they will be, for Hell, firewood} [al-Jinn 72:14].\nAs for the word al-Muqsit, it is one of the names of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, for He is al-`Adil (the Just) Whose justice is perfect; it is more emphatic in meaning than the name al-`Adil.\nHence al-`Adil is not one of the names of Allah; rather al-Musqit is one of His names. One of the attributes of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, is that He is al-Hakm al-‘Adl (the just Judge); al-`A dl means that He is the possessor of justice, and al-Muqsit is more emphatic in meaning than al-`Adl, because iqsat is `adl (justice) and more. (End quote from Sharh al-`Aqidah al-Wasitah, 1/211)\nWhat it means – assuming that it is proven to be one of the divine names – is: the One Who is just in His judgement, and does not wrong anyone or treat anyone unfairly, for He, may He be glorified, is the One Who deals with His slaves on the basis of justice (al-`adl). Or it may mean that He is the One Who gives each person a share (qist) of His bounty.\n(Ifrad Ahadith Asma’ Allahi wa Sifatihi, 1/135).\nFor more information, please see the answers to questions no. 84270 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/330932/is-al-muqsit-the-most-just-one-of-the-names-of-allah
512399,"If I take the voice of a human and put it through an AI program and make it recite the Quran, is that haram or halal? And will it bring reward?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt is not permissible to make voices, or to manipulate them or alter them, except with the permission of their owners, so as to avoid troubles, tampering and upsetting others.\nSomeone may take a person’s voice and manipulate it, making it say evil words or make statements or give instructions in his will, and so on, and that will result in wealth being taken unlawfully and people’s honour being tarnished, resulting in confusion and chaos. Therefore it is not permissible to do that except with the permission of the owners of the voices in question, for permissible purposes which not detrimental to anyone.\nFrom the above, we may conclude that using someone’s voice and making it say things is only permissible when it meets the following conditions:\n\nIt should be done with the permission of the owner of the voice.\nIt should be done for a permissible purpose.\nIt should not lead to any harm.\n\nIf the owner of the voice gives permission for his voice to be used to recite Quran, there is nothing wrong with that.\nSecondly:\nIf someone’s voice is used to recite Quran even though in reality he did not recite it, he will not attain a reward for reciting Quran, but if someone else benefits from this recitation, he will be rewarded for benefitting people and calling them to what is good, because in this case the voice is a tool which is being used for good, and the owner of the voice gave permission for that, so he will have a share in the reward.\nBut if someone gives permission for his voice to be used for haram purposes, such as singing, and it is shared among people, then he will be a partner in that sin.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And cooperate in righteousness and piety, but do not cooperate in sin and transgression. And fear Allah; indeed, Allah is severe in penalty}\xa0[al-Ma’idah 5:3].\nMuslim (2674) narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever calls others to guidance will have a reward like that of those who follow it, without that detracting from their reward in the slightest. And whoever calls others to misguidance will have a burden of sin like that of those who follow it, without it detracting from their burden in the slightest.”\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Sharh Muslim (16/226): Regarding the Prophet’s words “Whoever sets a good precedent… Whoever sets a bad precedent…” and, in the other hadith, “Whoever calls others to guidance… whoever calls others to misguidance…”:\nThese two hadiths clearly indicate that it is recommended (mustahabb) to set good precedents and it is forbidden to set bad precedents, and that whoever sets a good precedent will have a reward like that of everyone who acts upon it until the Day of Resurrection, and whoever sets a bad precedent will have a burden of sin like that of everyone who acts upon it until the Day of Resurrection. The one who calls people to guidance will have a reward like that of those who follow it, and the one who calls people to misguidance will have a burden of sin like that of those who follow it, whether he is the one who started that guidance or misguidance, or someone else did that before him, and whether it involves teaching knowledge, an act of worship, a matter of etiquette or anything else.\nThe Prophet’s words “and it is acted upon after he is gone” mean: if he sets the precedent, whether others act upon it during his lifetime or after his death.

82641,I would like to ask about the rights of the wife in the case of divorce when she has custody. Please note that she is the one who asked for divorce.,"[""Praise be to Allah.Asking for divorce due to husband's shortcomings\nIf a woman has asked for divorce – when her husband has consummated the marriage with her – one of two scenarios must apply:\xa0\n\nEither she has asked for it because of the husband`s shortcomings in fulfilling her rights, or because of some attitude in him that annoys her and deprives her of her rights, or because he has fallen into sin, and other such reasons which make it permissible for her to ask for divorce. The Shar`i judge is the one who should evaluate them and decide whether they are valid reasons or not. If they are valid, then the husband must divorce her by divorce in that case, and give her all her rights in full, which are:\xa0\n\n\nThe full dowry that was agreed upon, both the earlier portion, if any of it is still outstanding, and the delayed portion, because the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If he has consummated the marriage with her, then the mahr is hers because of his intimacy with her.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 1102; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Irwa` Al-Ghalil, 1840)\nReasonable maintenance, including food, drink, accommodation and clothing during the `Iddah period , if it is revocable divorce.\n\nShaykh Salih Al-Fawzan (may Allah preserve him) said:\xa0\n“The woman who has been revocably divorced is still a wife so long as the `Iddah continues, and she is entitled to the same as other wives of maintenance, clothing and accommodation.” (End quote from Al-Mulakhkhas Al-Fiqhi, 2/317)\xa0\nIf the divorce is not revocable, such as a third divorce, then she is not entitled to maintenance or accommodation.\xa0\nMuslim (1480) narrated that Fatimah bint Qays (may Allah be pleased with her) was divorced by her husband for a third time, and she asked the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about what she was entitled to of maintenance. He said:\xa0 “You are not entitled to maintenance or accommodation.”\xa0\nIf she has custody of her children from him, then in that case he must also give her:\xa0\n\nPayment for custody and breastfeeding.\nMaintenance for the children.\n\nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“The mothers shall give suck to their children for two whole years, (that is) for those (parents) who desire to complete the term of suckling, but the father of the child shall bear the cost of the mother`s food and clothing on a reasonable basis. No person shall have a burden laid on him greater than he can bear.” [Al-Baqarah 2:233]\xa0\nSo Allah has made it obligatory for the father of the child to spend on the mother who breastfeeds her child. This includes the woman who is pregnant or divorced; the father must pay for maintenance. (End quote from Tafsir As-Sa`di, p. 105).\xa0\nShaykh Muhammad ibn Salih Al-`Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“The woman who is thrice-divorced is not entitled to maintenance from her husband for herself, but he should spend on her for the sake of the pregnancy. On that basis, whatever she needs of maintenance because of the pregnancy, the husband must provide it, and after the delivery, he should pay for the breastfeeding and clothing and the like of the child, but he is not obliged to provide the mother’s food after the delivery. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \xa0\n“And if they are pregnant, then spend on them till they lay down their burden” [Al-Talaq 65:6].” (End quote from Liqa`at Al-Bab Al-Maftuh, 147/question no. 8)\xa0\nIt says in Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah (17/311):\xa0\n“The Shafi`is and Hanbalis are of the view that the woman who has custody is entitled to demand payment for custody, whether the woman with custody is the mother or someone else, because custody is not obligatory for the mother, and if she refuses custody it should not be forced upon her, generally speaking.” (End quote)\nSetting the amount of payment and maintenance should be referred to the judge.\xa0\nIt is not permissible for the husband to put pressure on his wife so that she will give up any of the rights mentioned above.\xa0\nAsking for divorce for no reason\n\nThe second scenario is where the woman asks for divorce from the husband with no cause. In that case the husband may ask her to return the dowry that he gave her, in return for divorcing her. This is what is called Khul` .\xa0\n\nIn this case, the four rights mentioned above no longer remain, except payment for breastfeeding and custody, and maintenance of the child who is still being breastfed.\xa0\n`Abd Ar-Razzaq narrated in Al-Musannaf (4/90) that Ash-Sha`bi was asked about the woman who is divorced by Khul` – is she entitled to maintenance?\xa0\nHe said: How can he spend on her when he takes from her?\xa0\nBecause if the Khul` is done, the husband cannot take her back, so she is like one who is irrevocably divorced, and is not entitled to maintenance.\xa0\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“The irrevocably divorced woman (unless she is pregnant) is not entitled to maintenance or accommodation according to the authentic Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him); indeed this is in accordance with the Book of Allah and is what is implied by analogy and it is the view of the scholars of Hadith.” (End quote from I`lam Al-Muwaqqi`in, 3/378)\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/82641/rights-of-women-after-divorce-in-islam
