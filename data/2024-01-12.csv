439738,"I have been working for twenty-three years, and I am still working. For approximately fifteen years, my father used to take some of my salary to buy land with it and build on it. Please note that he is financially well off. He also used to pay most of the price from his own pocket, but that was so that he would be able to buy and build quickly. During this time, he registered some properties in my name, and he finished building on some of them. Because my father is sick, following a stroke, and is now cognitively impaired and not aware of anything, my question is: what is the ruling on these properties? Are they regarded as part of my father’s wealth? Please note that I have siblings, and now I am in charge of these properties. My second question is: I am now managing these properties, but I do not take any of his wealth; rather I am working to grow his wealth, and it takes up a lot of my time and energy. What you think about that?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nWhat you gave to your father is subject to discussion:\n1. If it was by way of a gift, then the properties all belong to your father, even if he registered some of them in your name.\nIt is not permissible to take back a gift, because of the report narrated by Abu Dawud (3539), at-Tirmidhi (2132), al-Nasa’i (3690) and Ibn Majah (2377) from Ibn ‘Umar and Ibn ‘Abbas from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) who said: “It is not permissible for a man to give a gift or a present then take it back, except in the case of what a father gives to his son. The likeness of the one who gives a gift then takes it back is that of a dog that eats then when it is full it vomits, then it goes back to its vomit.” This hadith was classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud.\n2. If that was a partnership, meaning that some of the property belongs to you, then if what he registered in your name is equivalent to what you gave, then those properties belong to you.\nBut if what he registered in your name is worth more than you are entitled to, the extra amount was a gift, but he has to be fair in giving gifts to his other children, unless your siblings agreed to that. If they did not agree to your receiving something extra, then it must be returned to your father’s wealth.\nSecondly:\nThe wealth of your father who is cognitively impaired and no longer aware of things must be kept and not spent on anything, except on his maintenance and the maintenance of those on whom he is obliged to spend.\nIn al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (45/162) it says: There is no difference of opinion among the jurists regarding the fact that it is not permissible for the guardian to dispose of the wealth of one who is legally incompetent except in the most careful and prudent manner, and in the manner that best serves his interests, because of the hadith: “There should be no harm and no reciprocating harm.”\nBased on that, they said: Handling the money in a manner that serves no interest for the legally incompetent person – such as giving gifts for nothing in return, making bequests on his behalf, giving charity on his behalf, manumitting a slave of his, or showing favouritism when selling – is something that the guardian has no right to do, and he is liable for whatever he gives as a gift or a charity, or for manumitting the slave, or showing favouritism when buying and selling, or if he spends more than is proper on maintenance, or he gives any of the wealth to someone who is not trustworthy, because he is giving away that which belongs to him without getting anything in return, so it is pure harm…\nThere is no difference of opinion among the jurists regarding the fact that the guardian must spend from the wealth of the person under his care on his maintenance and that of those on whom he is obliged to spend, on a reasonable basis, without being extravagant or stingy, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And who, when they spend, are neither extravagant nor stingy, but follow a middle path between the [two]}\xa0[al-Furqan 25:70].\nThe Shafa‘is and Hanbalis added: If he is stingy in spending on maintenance, he is sinning, and if he is extravagant, he is sinning, and he is liable for his negligence. End quote.\nThirdly:\nIt is permissible to take some payment on a reasonable basis for developing and growing the wealth, if that takes time and effort, provided that it is no more than the going rate for similar work, because the son is not obliged to work with his father or to develop his wealth.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/439738/his-father-used-to-take-some-of-his-salary-and-buy-property-with-it-then-he-became-cognitively-impaired-does-he-have-any-right-to-that-property
129635,How did the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) conclude his marriages? How was it done? How did he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) consummate the marriage offer feasts? What did he offer as Mahr (bridal money) in detail?,"[""Praise be to Allah.Prophet Muhammad’s Guidance on Marriage\nThe guidance of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) with regard to marriage was that he encouraged making it easy, announcing it and proclaiming it openly, and expressing joy and happiness on this occasion; making a wedding feast and inviting people to it; enjoining those who are invited to attend, and even if a person is fasting he should attend and offer Du`a’ for the host of the feast, but he does not have to eat.\xa0\nThen he enjoined treating the wife with kindness and trying one's best to achieve that.\xa0\nThis is in general terms. There follows a detailed discussion:\xa0\nAffordable dowry (Mahr)\xa0\nAl-Bayhaqi (14721) narrated that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The best of dowries is that which is most affordable.” It was narrated by Abu Dawud (2117) with the wording: “The best of marriages is that which is most affordable.” This was classed as authentic by Al-Albani.\xa0\nIt says in ‘Awn Al-Ma`bud:\xa0“I.e. the easiest for the man by making the dowry and so on easy. Al-`Allamah Ash-Shaykh Al-`Azizi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: i.e., the lowest dowry or the easiest in accepting the proposal.”\xa0\nAhmad (23957) and Ibn Majah (4095) narrated from `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “One of the signs of a woman being blessed is that the process of proposing to her is made easy and the dowry is made affordable and she bears children easily.” (Classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih Al-Jami`, 2235)\xa0\nAt-Tirmidhi (1114) narrated that `Umar ibn Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Do not go to extremes with regard to women's dowries. If that were something honourable in this world or a sign of piety before Allah, then the Prophet of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would have been the most entitled to it, but I never heard that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) offered as a dowry for any of his wives or accepted as a dowry for any of his daughters anything more than twelve Uqiyah. (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Tirmidhi)\xa0\nAn Uqiyah is 40 Dirhams; the weight of a Dirham in grams is 2.975 g [of silver].\xa0\nAnnouncing the marriage\xa0\nAt-Tirmidhi (1089) narrated from `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that she said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Announce this marriage .” (Classed as sound by Al-Albani in Al-Irwa’, 7/50)\xa0\nAn-Nasa’i (3369) narrated that Muhammad ibn Hatib (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “What separates permissible from prohibited is\xa0 [beating] the Daff and singing at the wedding.” (Classed as sound by Al-Albani)\xa0\nBeating the daff at weddings is limited to women only\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Fath: “In the strong Hadiths, there is permission for that for women; it is not appropriate for men, because of the general prohibition on men resembling women.”\xa0\nThe wedding feast (Walimah)\xa0\nThis is a confirmed Sunnah at weddings and it is part of announcing the marriage and of expressing joy and happiness on this occasion.\xa0\nIt was narrated from Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to `Abd Ar-Rahman ibn `Awf (may Allah be pleased with him) when he got married: “Give a feast even if it is with just one sheep.” (Al-Bukhari and Muslim)\xa0\nSome of the scholars said that this is obligatory, because of the reports narrated by Ahmad (22526) from Ibn Buraydah from his father, who said: When `Ali proposed to Fatimah (may Allah be pleased with them both), the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There has to be a feast for the wedding.” Al-Albani said in Adab Al-Zafaf (72): “There is nothing wrong with its Isnad [chain of narration], as Ibn Hajar said in Al-Fath.”\xa0\nIt is obligatory to attend the feast if invited . It was narrated from `Abdullah ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If one of you is invited to the feast, let him go to it.” (Al-Bukhari and Muslim)\xa0\nIbn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy upon him) said:\xa0\n“The scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) say that it is obligatory to respond to the first invitation, i.e., if one is mentioned by name and invited as an individual, whether the host invites him himself or through a deputy or by means of a card sent to him, on condition that there be no evils involved in the wedding feast. If there is any evil involved, then it depends: if when attending he is able to prevent the evil, then he must attend; if he is not able to do that, then it is not permissible for him to attend.” (Liqa’ Al-Bab Al-Maftuh, 13/133)\xa0\nIt is permissible to offer a wedding feast without meat. Al-Bukhari (4213) narrated that Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) halted between Khaybar and Madinah for three days, during which he married Safiyyah (may Allah be pleased with her). I invited the Muslims to his wedding feast, in which there was no bread and no meat; there was nothing except what the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) commanded Bilal (may Allah be pleased with him) to spread out of leather mats, on which dates, ghee and dried yoghurt were placed.\xa0\nHow to congratulate someone on marriage\nIt is recommended to congratulate the husband as the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) congratulated people. It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that when a man got married he would congratulate him and pray for him, saying: “May Allah bless you and bring blessings upon you and bring you together in goodness.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud (2130) and classed as authentic by Al-Albani)\xa0\nWhat to do on wedding night\nIt is recommended for the husband to do several things when he enters upon his wife, including the following:\xa0\n\nBeing kind and gentle to his wife when consummating the marriage with her\n\nIt was narrated by Ahmad (26925) that Asma’ bint `Umays (may Allah be pleased with her) said: I was the one who took care of `Aishah and prepared her for her marriage to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and I had some women with me. She said: By Allah, we did not find any food with him except a vessel of milk. He drank from it then he passed it to `Aishah, but the young girl felt too shy. We said: Do not turn away the hand of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him); take it from him. She took it shyly and drank from it, then he said: Pass it to your friends. We said: We do not feel like drinking it. He (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: Do not combine hunger with lies. (Classed as sound by Al-Albani in Adab Al-Zafaf, 19)\xa0\n\nPutting his hand on his wife's head and praying for her\n\nBecause of the reports narrated by Abu Dawud (2160) from `Amr ibn Shu`ayb, from his father, from his grandfather, from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) who said: “ When one of you marries a woman, let him take hold of her forelock and say: O Allah, I ask You for the goodness within her and the goodness that You have made her inclined towards, and I take refuge with You from the evil within her and the evil that You have made her inclined towards.” (Classed as sound by Al-Albani)\xa0\n\nSome of the Salaf regarded it as recommended for them to pray two Rak`ahs together :\n\nIbn Abu Shaybah (17156) narrated that Shaqiq said: A man came to `Abdullah ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) and said: ‘I have married a young virgin girl, but I am afraid that she may hate me.’ `Abdullah said: ‘Love comes from Allah and hatred comes from satan, who wants to make you hate what Allah has made permissible. When she comes to you, tell her to pray two Rak`ahs behind you.’” (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Adab Al-Zafaf, 24)\xa0\n\nHe should say before he has intercourse with his wife: Bismillahi Allahumma jannibna Ash-Shaytan wa jannib Ash-Shaytan ma razaqtana (In the name of Allah, O Allah, protect us from satan and protect whatever You give to us from satan)’ because of the report narrated by Al-Bukhari (3271) from Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When one of you wants to approach (have intercourse with) his wife, if he says: ‘Bismillahi Allahumma jannibna Ash-Shaytan wa jannib Ash-Shaytan ma razaqtana (In the name of Allah, O Allah, protect us from satan and protect whatever You give to us from satan )’ – then if they are given a child, satan will not harm it.”\xa0\nWe affirm the importance of kind treatment of the wife and fearing Allah with regard to her, and that she should fear Allah with regard to him (the husband).\xa0\n\nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“and live with them honourably. If you dislike them, it may be that you dislike a thing and Allah brings through it a great deal of good.” [An-Nisa’ 4:19]\xa0\nAlso, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If a woman offers her five daily prayers, fasts her month (Ramadan), guards her chastity and obeys her husband, it will be said to her: Enter Paradise from whichever of the Gates of Paradise you wish.” (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Takhrij Al-Mishkat, 3254)\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/129635/prophet-muhammads-guidance-on-marriage
374172,"My question is about new conditions that are stipulated by the YouTube website, which we received two weeks ago. As a content creator, we have no choice but to accept them. One of the clauses gives YouTube the right to put ads on my videos and make money from that, even without my consent, and without me subscribing to the advertising program (the profits go to the owners of YouTube only, and not to me, but the issue of helping in sin and transgression is still there, because the followers of my channel will see the YouTube ads that are filled with things that are contrary to Islamic teachings). What is the ruling on posting my content on YouTube in the future, and what is the ruling on leaving my old videos there, because all the content will be affected by the ads? Please advise us, thank you.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIn principle, it is not allowed to take part in or contribute to posting any ads that contain or promote anything objectionable, because posting that is helping to spread sin and exposing the viewers to seeing sin, and Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {And cooperate in righteousness and piety, but do not cooperate in sin and transgression. And fear Allah; indeed, Allah is severe in penalty} [al-Ma’idah 5:2].\nBased on that, if it is possible for the content creator to prevent ads altogether, or to prevent the ads which he thinks are most likely to contain objectionable material, even if that is by paying a monthly subscription that he can afford without suffering harm, then he must do that, and it is not permissible for him to allow ads to appear on his content, and what that could lead to of spreading mischief.\nSimilar to that, if shar‘i interests can be achieved by posting his content on another website, that does not require him to have these ads and other evils, then he should move to that website and should not take part in supporting websites in which there is a great deal of evil. If it is not possible to prevent ads, or to have any control over them, even by paying money that the content creator can afford, and the content he posts is beneficial and posting it on YouTube serves a greater interest, then what appears to be the case is that there is no blame on him for that, and the sin of the objectionable material is only on those who make and post it. The greater interest served by your content, such as teaching people, benefitting them, calling them to Islam and guiding them, should not be abandoned because of something objectionable in the ads. That is for the following reasons:\n\nThe ads that appear in video clips are a widespread problem and it is difficult to avoid it except with great hardship.\nThe channel owner or producer of videos has nothing to do with the ads and has no control over them and no ability to limit them.\nRefraining from posting will leave more room for others to post evil and trivial content.\nSeeking to crowd out falsehood and outnumber such material by posting useful and beneficial videos, or even those that are merely permissible, is a valid objective according to Islamic teachings\n\nAl-Shatibi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: With regard to basic activities that are, in principle, allowed in Islam, if they involve some infractions – such as buying and selling, mixing with people and living among them – when mischief has become widespread in the land and evil activities have increased and become normalized, such that when the accountable person is going about his business to meet his needs and do other ordinary, daily activities, he will in most cases be unable to avoid coming across some infractions and evils… If we realise that refraining from going about one’s business could cause undue hardship to a person and impose on him restrictions that he cannot bear, that is something for which this ummah is excused. In that case, the individual has no choice but to carry on, but he must refrain from whatever he can refrain from, and anything else may be overlooked, because his excuse is due to his situation, not because these things are acceptable in principle.""(Al-Muwafaqat\xa0 3/526-527).\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf a man in a position of leadership does what is required of him, of enjoining what is right, forbidding what is wrong, striving in jihad, doing what is required of a man in a position of authority, and so on, then he will inevitably commit some infractions. What is required of him is to see which of the two matters is dominant. If what is enjoined in Islamic teachings will bring greater reward than refraining from the infractions, then he should not give up his position because of what he fears of falling into infractions which are outweighed by the benefits. But if refraining from infractions will bring him greater reward, he should not miss out on that reward in the hope of getting reward for doing obligatory actions that bring less reward. This issue should be judged by comparing and weighing up the good deeds and bad deeds in both scenarios. This is how the matter should be examined, but explaining that in detail would take too long.""(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa\xa0 28/168).\nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 119222 .\nSecondly:\nEveryone who watches video clips on YouTube or elsewhere should take whatever he can of measures to help prevent these ads appearing. This is possible by using some programs or other ways that are known to experts, and you can easily obtain them.\nThirdly:\nThe money that the channel owner or publisher of videos earns because of the ads is mixed wealth, some of which is halal and some is haram. He must work out the proportion of it that is haram, based on what he thinks is most likely to be the case, and get rid of it by giving it in charity to the poor and needy. If he cannot work it out precisely, he should work out what is most likely to absolve him of responsibility.\nFourthly:\nAs for those who publish content that is of no benefit and has nothing to do with what people need in their religious or worldly affairs, and have no aim except to make money from ads, it is not permissible for them to pursue this method of earning money, because it is profit that is tainted by committing haram, and there is no interest that could equal or outweigh the mischief involved, such that a concession could be granted to do that.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/374172/ruling-on-posting-videos-on-youtube-with-ads-that-appear-and-one-has-no-control-over-their-content
235370,"Is living in the city of the Messenger of Allah better, or living in Makkah Al-Mukarramah? What are the differences that make one of the two cities better than the other, apart from the difference of virtue of praying in the two Harams?","['Praise be to Allah.Which city is the best for living as a Muslim?\nThe best spot on earth, in and of itself, is Makkah, then Madinah.\nWith regard to individuals, what is best for each person is to live in the city where his faith will increase and he will be able to worship and obey Allah, may He be Exalted, more.\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“The best place on earth for each individual is the land where he will be more able to obey Allah and His Messenger, which varies according to circumstances. There is no specific land in which it is best for a person to reside. Rather what is best for each individual is to be determined based on the degree to which he will be able to attain piety, obedience, humility before Allah, submission and focus on worship. Abu Ad-Darda’ (may Allah be pleased with him) wrote to Salman (may Allah be pleased with him), saying: Come to the holy land. Salman wrote to him: The land does not sanctify anyone; rather what sanctifies a person is his deeds.” (Majmoo‘ Al-Fatawa, 18/283)\nVirtues of Makkah\xa0\nMakkah is distinct from Madinah and other cities because of a number of virtues, of which we will mention the following:\n\nOne prayer in Al-Masjid Al-Haram in Makkah is better than one hundred thousand prayers offered in any other mosque, except Al-Masjid An-Nabawi [the Prophet’s mosque], in which one prayer is better than a thousand prayers offered elsewhere.\nMakkah is unique in that it is the place where Hajj and ‘Umrah are performed, people circumambulate the Ka‘bah, touch the Black Stone and the Yemeni Corner (Ar-Rukn Al-Yamani), and do Sa‘i between As-Safa and Al-Marwah.\nAllah, may He be Exalted, swears by it, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): “I swear by this city (Makkah)” [Al-Balad 90:1].\nAllah, may He be Exalted, decreed Makkah to be a sanctuary the day He created the heavens and the earth, which is not the case with Madinah.\nThe sanctity of Makkah is greater than that of Madinah.\xa0\n\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Madinah is a sanctuary and enjoys sanctity, but its sanctity is much less than that of Makkah. No Muslim can come to the sanctuary of Makkah from outside the Haram boundary, unless he is in the state of Ihram, and he must enter Ihram. That is not so in the case of Madinah.\nIn the sanctuary of Makkah, the grass and trees (i.e., all plants) are protected, whereas in the sanctuary of Madinah, a concession is granted regarding some of its trees for the purpose of agriculture and the like.\nHunting game in Makkah is prohibited, and a penalty must be paid for that, whereas no penalty is required for hunting game in Madinah.\nThe point is that the safest place is Makkah, where even the trees are safe, and even game animals are safe.” (Liqa’ Al-Bab Al-Maftooh, 103/2)\nVirtues of Madinah\n\nMadinah is the location of Hijrah (migration), the place where the Muhajirin and Ansar came together. And it is the centre of Jihad, from which the armies marched forth and campaigns were launched, from which lands were conquered, the religion spread and Shirk and its people were defeated.\nIn Madinah, most of the verses on rulings and laws were revealed. When the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) conquered Makkah, he did not settle there; rather he returned to Madinah, the city to which he had migrated, and lived there until he died and was buried in that city.\n\nAl-Bukhari (3778) and Muslim (1059) narrated that Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Ansar said on the day of the conquest of Makkah, when (the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) gave (some of the booty) to Quraysh: By Allah, this is strange. Our swords are still dripping with the blood of Quraysh, and our spoils have been given to them! News of that reached the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), so he summoned the Ansar and said: “What is this that I have heard about you?” They were people who never told lies, so they said: It is what you have heard. He (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Does it not please you that the people are going back to their houses with worldly gains whilst you are going back to your houses with the Messenger of Allah? If the Ansar were to follow a valley or mountain pass, I would follow the valley or mountain pass of the Ansar.”\nAl-Bukhari (1871) and Muslim (1382) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “I have been enjoined (to go to) a city which supersedes other cities. They say Yathrib, but it is Madinah. It purifies people as the bellows eliminates the impurities of iron.”\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“With regard to it superseding all other cities, they mentioned two meanings, the first of which is that it was the centre for the armies of Islam in the beginning, and from it other cities were conquered and their wealth and captives seized. The second meaning is that it superseded and its food and provision came to it from the conquered cities, from which booty was brought to it.” (Sharh An-Nawawi ‘Ala Muslim, 9/154)\nAl-Bukhari (1876) and Muslim (147) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Faith will retreat to Madinah as a snake retreats to its hole.” (Mirqat Al-Mafateeh, 1/243)\nMadinah is the gathering-point of the Muslims in the beginning and at the end. An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Faith will retreat to Madinah” – what is meant is that this is how faith is in the beginning and at the end, because at the beginning of Islam, everyone whose faith was sincere and whose Islam was valid came to Madinah, either as a Muhajir (migrant) coming to settle there, or out of a longing to see the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and to learn from him and be near to him; then after that, at the time of the caliphs, people did the same, so they came to learn about the straight path from them and follow the example of the majority of the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) living there; then after that, they came to learn from the scholars of Madinah who were a shining lamp of that era, and the Imams of guidance, to learn Islam and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that the Companions narrated to subsequent generations…. Therefore everyone who was steadfast in faith and at ease with it would travel there. “ (Sharh An-Nawawi ‘Ala Muslim, 2/177)\n\nIn Madinah there is the Prophet’s Mosque and the blessed Rawdah. Al-Bukhari (1196) and Muslim (1391) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The area between my house and my minbar is one of the gardens of Paradise, and my minbar is upon my cistern (Hawd).”\n\nIn it is the valley of Al-‘Aqiq, which is a blessed valley. Al-Bukhari (1534) narrated from Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that he heard ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) say: I heard the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) saying in the valley of Al-‘Aqiq: “Last night someone came to me from my Lord and said: ‘Pray in this blessed valley, and say: (I intend to do) ‘Umrah and Hajj.’”\n\nNo one intends ill towards the people of Madinah but Allah will destroy him.\n\nAl-Bukhari (1877) and Muslim (1363) narrated that Sa‘d (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “No one plots against the people of Madinah but Allah will cause him to dissolve as salt dissolves in water.”\nWhomever Allah blesses by causing him to live in Makkah, congratulations to him; and whomever Allah blesses by causing him to live in Madinah, congratulations to him; and whomever Allah blesses with piety – no matter where on Allah’s earth he lives – congratulations to him.\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 146927 , 228704 , 20965 , and 47736 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/235370/virtues-of-makkah-and-madinah
