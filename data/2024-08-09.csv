315954,"We live in a western country, where there are restaurants which sell pizza meals of different types, and they also sell types of pizza with pieces of pork. Of course we only order cheese or vegetable pizza, but the problem is that the workers do not wash their hands every time they have touched pork, and when someone who is not Muslim orders a pizza that has pork and vegetables, for example, the worker touches the pork, and after that he touches some vegetables and puts his hand in them, and he may touch some other wet things in the restaurant, to which the impurity of the pork could be transferred, as the vegetables are naturally wet. My question is: do the other pieces of vegetables and pieces of cheese become impure, which the worker’s hand may or may not have touched? On that basis, is it haram to eat the pizza on which there is nothing except cheese or cheese and vegetables? Finally, we always ask the worker to wash his hands and to wash the knife and other things, before cutting the pizza.","['Praise be to Allah.Pork is impure according to scholarly consensus, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Say, ""I do not find within that which was revealed to me [anything] forbidden to one who would eat it unless it be a dead animal or blood spilled out or the flesh of swine - for indeed, it is impure - or it be [that slaughtered in] disobedience, dedicated to other than Allah}\xa0[al-An‘am 6:145].\nIf the worker touches the pork, then put his hand in the wet vegetables, that makes them impure. Similarly, if he cuts a pizza on which there is pork with a knife, then uses the knife before washing it to cut another pizza, that makes it impure, and it is well known that it is not permissible to eat food that is contaminated with impurity.\nThe basis for that is the report narrated by al-Bukhari (5478) and Muslim (1930) from Abu Tha‘labah al-Khushani, who said: I said: O Prophet of Allah, we are in the land of some of the People of the book; can we eat from their vessels? He said: “If you can find other vessels, then do not eat from them, but if you cannot find other vessels, then wash them and eat from them.”\nThis is to be understood as referring to someone who uses their vessels in which there are impurities, as in the version of this hadith narrated by Abu Dawud (3839): We live close to some the people of the Book and they cook pork in their pots and drink wine in their vessels. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If you can find something else, eat and drink from it. If you cannot find anything else, then wash them with water and eat and drink.”\nThe scholars of the Permanent Committee for Ifta’ were asked: Some restaurants grill beef on the same hotplate as pork. Is it permissible to eat that meat? Similarly, they use the same knife to cut the meat.\nThey replied: It is not permissible to eat beef that is grilled on the same hotplate as pork. The same applies to the knife.""(Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah\xa022/285).\nPlease see the answers to question no. 465771 .\nIf you are certain that the worker washes his hands before touching the vegetables and dough, and he washes the knife before cutting the pizza, it is permissible to eat those foods that are permissible.\nIf you are uncertain about that, it is not permissible, because the basic principle is that the impurity remains on his hand and on the knife after touching the pork, and this uncertainty cannot be dispelled unless you are certain that he has washed both.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/315954/is-it-permissible-to-eat-pizza-if-it-has-been-cut-with-a-knife-that-was-used-for-cutting-pork
466448,"I work in a pharmacy, and there are some medicines that are taken by addicts to use for wrongful purposes. When someone comes about whom I have doubts, I lie to him and say that it is not available. Am I sinning for telling this lie? But I am concerned about two things: firstly, that I am giving him the medicine to which he is addicted, so I will have helped someone to take drugs, or if I withhold it from him and he is actually sick, then I will have withheld his medicine from him.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe medicines that are sold in pharmacies are of two types:\n-1-\nThose which the health authorities have classified as narcotics. They are not to be sold except with a doctor’s prescription, and it is not permissible for the doctor to prescribe them except in the case of extreme need, when there is no permissible alternative available.\nThe scholars of the Permanent Committee for Ifta’ were asked:\nWhat is the ruling on using pethidine or morphine, which are drugs with a narcotic effect, in the case of necessity or when needed?\nThey replied: If no other permissible medication is known that could be used to alleviate the patient’s pain except these two medications, it is permissible to use either of them to alleviate pain when necessary. That is so long as no greater or equal harm could result from using them, such as becoming addicted to using them.\nShaykh ‘Abd al-Aziz ibn Baz, Shaykh ‘Abd ar-Razzaq ‘Afifi, Shaykh ‘Abdullah ibn Ghadyan, Shaykh ‘Abdullah ibn Qa‘ud\nEnd quote from Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah (25/77-78).\n-2-\nThose which are not classified as narcotic. In principle, it is permissible to sell them, unless it is known or thought most likely that the purchaser is buying it for some haram purpose, such as intoxication or getting high, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And cooperate in righteousness and piety, but do not cooperate in sin and transgression. And fear Allah; indeed, Allah is severe in penalty}\xa0[al-Ma’idah 5:2].\nSo if you think it most likely that someone is buying the medicine because he is addicted to it, then you should not sell it to him unless he has a doctor’s prescription.\nSecondly:\nIt is haram to lie except in the case of necessity or in situations in which Islamic teaching grants a concession.\nThe way out in this case is to use a double entendre. So, for example, you could say, “It is not available,” intending that it is not available to you, or to someone who does not have a doctor’s prescription. Or you could say, “It is not there,” meaning that it is not there on a certain shelf or in a certain section, where this medicine is not usually found.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: You should note that what is meant by a double entendre is saying words of which there is an apparent meaning, but you intend another meaning to which these words could also apply, that is different from the apparent meaning. This is a kind of cheating and deceiving. The scholars said that if there is a legitimate purpose to be served that outweighs the sin of deceit, or meets a need that cannot be met except by lying, then there is nothing wrong with using a double entendre. But if that is not the case, then it is disliked, although it is not prohibited, unless it is used as a means to acquire the wealth of others unlawfully or deny them their rights. In that case it is prohibited. This is the guideline regarding this matter.""(Al-Adhkaar, p. 380).\nSee also the answer to question no. 27261 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/466448/what-is-the-ruling-on-a-pharmacist-selling-medicine-when-he-thinks-it-most-likely-that-the-purchaser-is-going-to-use-it-as-a-drug-or-is-addicted-to-it
259154,"If we say “La ilaha ill-Allah wahdahu la sharika lah, lahu`l-mulk wa lahu`l-hamd wa huwa `ala kulli shay`in qadir (there is no god worthy of worship except Allah alone, with no partner or associate. His is the Dominion and to Him be praise, and He is able to do all things)” one hundred times at scattered intervals, will we attain the reward as is mentioned in this Hadith: “Whoever says `La ilaha illallah wahdahu la sharika lah, lahu`l-mulk wa lahu`l-hamd wa huwa `ala kulli shay`in qadir` one hundred times in a day, will have (a reward) equivalent to freeing ten slaves, one hundred hasanat (good deeds) will be recorded for him and one hundred sayyi`at (bad deeds) will be erased from him, and he will be protected from the Shaytan for that day until evening comes. No one can do anything better than what he has done except one who does more than that”? Can we reconcile between the above Hadith and the Hadith: “Whoever frees a Muslim slave, Allah will ransom each of his limbs from the Fire for each of (the slave`s) limbs, even his private part for (the slave`s) private part”?","['Praise be to Allah.The reward for saying `La ilaha illallah wahdahu la sharika lah…`\nAl-Bukhari (3292) and Muslim (2691) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever says, `La ilaha illallah  wahdahu la sharika lah, lahu’l-mulk wa lahu’l-hamd wa huwa `ala kulli shay`in qadir\xa0(there is no god worthy of worship except Allah alone, with no partner or associate. His is the Dominion and to Him be praise, and He is able to do all things)’ one hundred times in a day, will have (a reward) equivalent to freeing ten slaves, one hundred Hasanat (good deeds) will be recorded for him and one hundred Sayyi’at (bad deeds) will be erased from him, and he will be protected from the devil for that day until evening comes. No one can do anything better than what he has done except one who does more than that.”\nThere is no stipulation in the Hadith that the Dhikr mentioned should be repeated one hundred times consecutively in order to attain this virtue. What appears to be the case is that the matter is broad in scope, and that the criterion for attaining this reward is that it should be done all on the same day, not that it should be done consecutively.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe general meaning of the Hadith indicates that the reward mentioned may be attained by the one who repeats this Dhikr one hundred times in a day , whether he repeats it consecutively or at different times in several sessions, or he recites some of it at the beginning of the day and some at the end of the day. But the best is to recite it consecutively at the beginning of the day, so that it will be a protection for him throughout his day."" (Sharh An-Nawawi `ala Muslim,\xa0 17/17)\nHadiths which encourage and urge Muslims to free slaves\xa0\nThere are Hadiths from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) which encourage and urge Muslims to free slaves, one of which is that which was narrated by Al-Bukhari (6715) and Muslim (1509) from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever frees a Muslim slave, Allah will ransom each of his limbs from the Fire for each of (the slave’s) limbs, even his private part for (the slave’s) private part.”\nAhmad (15417) narrated from Sahl ibn Hunayf, from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that whoever helps a Mukatab [a slave who has a contract of manumission with his master] to buy his freedom, Allah will shade him with His shade on the Day when there will be no shade except His shade.\nThere is no contradiction between the two Hadiths at all, such that we might seek to reconcile between them. Rather the Hadith which speaks of the virtue of this Dhikr says that for the one who says “La ilaha illallah  wahdahu la sharika lah, lahu’l-mulk wa lahu’l-hamd wa huwa `ala kulli shay’in qadir” one hundred times in a day there is the hope of reward, virtue and ransom from the Fire, just as there is the same hope for the one who liberates a Muslim slave from enslavement. This was stated clearly by Al-Qadi `Iyad (may Allah have mercy on him). (See:\xa0Sharh An-Nawawi `ala Muslim,\xa017/18)\nThere is nothing in the Hadith itself to explain what is hoped for the one who ransoms a Muslim slave.\nRather that is mentioned in the other Hadith, which states that for each limb of the liberated slave, Allah will ransom from the Fire one limb of the body of the one who ransomed him. The grace of Allah is vast and His generosity is immense.\nIbn Rajab said:\n“The one who understands the true meaning of Tawhid will be motivated to free slaves, and freeing slaves will be rewarded with ransom from the Fire, as it is proven in\xa0Al-Bukhari and Muslim\xa0that the one who says this Dhikr one hundred times will have (a reward) equivalent to freeing ten slaves.\nIt is also proven that the one who says this Dhikr ten times will be like the one who manumitted four of the descendants of Isma`il.\nIn\xa0Sunan Abu Dawud\xa0and elsewhere it is narrated from Anas that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever says in the morning and the afternoon: `Allahumma inni asbahtu ushhiduka wa ushhidu hamalata `arshika wa mala’ikataka wa jamee‘a khalqika annaka anta Allahu la ilaha illa anta wa anna Muhammadan `abduka wa rasuluka\xa0(O Allah, on this morning and I call upon You and I call upon the bearers of Your Throne, Your angels and all of Your creation to bear witness that You are Allah, there is no god worthy of worship except You, and that Muhammad is Your slave and Your Messenger),’ Allah will ransom one quarter of him from the Fire. Whoever says it twice, Allah will ransom half of him from the Fire; whoever says it three times, Allah will ransom three quarters of him from the Fire; and whoever says it four times, Allah will ransom him from the Fire.” (Lata’if Al-Ma`arif\xa0p. 283)\nThis immense virtue should motivate one to be keen to do more good, and should deter one from being lethargic or too lazy to do acts of worship and obedience or from wondering about this reward and virtue and thinking that it is unlikely.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/259154/the-reward-for-saying-la-ilaha-ill-allah-wahdahu-la-sharika-lah
