161563,"I see many young men, even my friends, wearing strings around their necks, to which is usually attached pictures of the martyrs, or slogans about Palestine or al-Aqsa… What is the ruling on wearing such things, for men, with or without images or pictures?","['Praise be to Allah.These strings that are worn around the neck are either one of two things:\n1. Either they have images of living beings, so it is not permissible to wear them, either for men or for women. Please see the answer to question no. 7222 for more information on the ruling on images.\n2. Or they are free of images. If they are only worn by women, and there is nothing in then that is contrary to Islamic rulings, then there is nothing wrong with them.\nBut if they are for men, as the questioner mentioned, then it is not permissible for them to wear it, because wearing necklaces is something that is only for women, so wearing them is imitating women, and hardly anyone wears them in the manner in which women usually wear them except effeminate men (al-mukhannathun) – we seek refuge with Allah.\nIt is proven in the hadith of Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) cursed men who imitate women and women who imitate men. Narrated by al-Bukhari (5885).\nShaykh Muhammad ibn Salih al-‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about the ruling on men wearing chains, and he replied:\nWearing chains as adornment is haram [for men], because that is something that is only for women, and he is imitating women. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) cursed men who imitate women, and the prohibition and sin is exacerbated if it is made of gold, in which case it becomes haram for men on two counts, because it is gold and because it is imitating women. It becomes even more abhorrent if it contains an image of an animal or an angel, and even worse and more abhorrent than that is if it contains a cross. This is haram even for a woman, if she wears jewellery in which there is an image, whether it is an image of a human or an animal, a bird or not a bird, or if it contains the image of a cross. This – I mean wearing anything in which there is an image – is haram for both men and women, so it is not permissible for either of them to wear anything that contains the image of an animate being or the image of a cross. And Allah knows best.""(Majmu‘ Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymin\xa0 11/97).\nWith regard to these pendants, even if we assume that the men do not intend to adorn themselves with them, it is still not free from imitating women in wearing necklaces, and resembling immoral and effeminate men in their actions and adornment. So it is more appropriate to tell men not to wear them at all, and instead of that they can wear these slogans without putting them on necklaces.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/161563/ruling-on-wearing-a-string-around-the-neck-for-men
10373,My father passed away recently whilst on Hajj.,"['Praise be to Allah.Carrying the deceased and following the funeral\nIt is obligatory to carry the deceased and follow the funeral. This is one of the rights that the dead Muslim has over the Muslims, which will bring great reward and virtue to the one who does it.\xa0\nThe Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever attends the funeral from the house (of the deceased) [according to one report: whoever follows the funeral of a Muslim out of faith and the hope of reward] until the funeral prayer is offered will have one Qirat, and whoever attends the funeral until the deceased is buried will have two Qirats.” He was asked, “O Messenger of Allah, what are the two Qirats?” He said, “Like two huge mountains.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, Al-Jana’iz, 1240).\nIt is not permitted to follow funerals in manners that go against the Shari`ah. That includes:\n\nCrying or weeping in a loud voice;\xa0\nFollowing it with incense (Bukhur) etc.;\xa0\nReciting Dhikr in a loud voice in front of the coffin as it is being carried, because that is Bid’ah. Qays ibn `Abbad (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to regard it as disliked to raise the voice in front of the coffin” – and because it is an imitation of the Christians.\xa0\n\nHow to bury the deceased in Islam\nMuslims should not be buried with the disbelievers, nor the disbelievers with Muslims. The Muslim should be buried in the Muslim graveyard. \xa0\nThe Sunnah is to put the deceased into the grave from the end, then he should be turned onto his right side in the grave, with his face directed towards the Qiblah . The one who puts him into the Lahd  should say, “Bismillahi wa ‘ala sunnat Rasul-Allahi or ‘ala millat Rasul-Allahi (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) (In the name of Allah and according to the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah or according to the religion of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)).” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, Al-Jana’iz 967; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Sunan Abu Dawud, 836)\xa0\nIt is recommended for those who are at the grave to throw handfuls of earth, three handfuls scooped up in both hands, after the Lahd has been sealed.\nWhat to do after the burial?\nAfter the burial is complete, there are several things which are Sunnah:\xa0\n\nTo make the grave a little higher than the ground, approximately a handspan, and not to make it level with the ground, so that it may be distinguished as a grave and respected, and not subjected to disrespect. It should be made approximately a handspan higher than the ground, and there is nothing wrong with placing a marker such as a stone or something similar, so that others of his family may be buried near him later on. Water should be sprinkled on the grave so that the soil will settle and not fly around.\nNo one should stand by the grave telling the deceased that he will be questioned soon etc., as is the custom among some people.\nRather people should stand at the grave and pray for the deceased to be made steadfast and for forgiveness for him. Those who are present should be told to do this, because of the Hadith of `Uthman ibn `Affan (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: “When the deceased had been buried, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would stand by (the grave) and say: ‘Pray for forgiveness for your brother and ask for him to be made steadfast, for even now he is being questioned .’” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, Al-Jana’iz, 2804; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Sunan Abu Dawood, 2758)\xa0\nNothing of the Quran should be recited at the graveside, because this is Bid`ah. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not do this, and neither did his noble Companions.\xa0\nIt is prohibited to build up graves or to plaster them or to write anything on them, because Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade us to plaster graves with gypsum, to sit on them or to build anything over them.” (Narrated by Muslim, Al-Jana’iz, 1610. According to Abu Dawud,\xa0 “He forbade us\xa0 to plaster graves with gypsum, to write on them or to step on them.” (Al-Jana’iz, 3226. Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Sunan Abu Dawud, 2763)\xa0\n\nHow to offer condolences in Islam\nIt is prescribed in Islam to offer condolences to the family of the deceased. This should take the form of whatever is thought will bring them consolation, stem their grief and help them to be patient.\xa0\nCondolences should be offered in the manner reported from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) if one can remember that, otherwise use good words that come naturally which achieve the same purpose and align with Islamic principles.\xa0\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “To Allah belongs that which He has taken and that which He gives, and with Him everything has an appointed end, so be patient and seek reward.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, Al-Jana’iz, 1204)\xa0\nWhat to avoid when offering condolences?\nTwo things must be avoided:\n\nGathering to offer condolences, even though the people do that.\nThe family of the deceased preparing food to offer to those who come to offer condolences.\n\nThe Sunnah is for the relatives and neighbours of the deceased to make food enough for the bereaved family.\xa0\nReferences:\n\nAhkam Al-Jana’iz by Al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him).\nAl-Mulakhkhas Al-Fiqhi by Al-Fawzan (213-216).\n\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10373/how-to-bury-the-deceased
147291,"I know a woman who was in an accident and fell into a coma, which lasted for one month and five days, and for three months she was unable to pray. Please advise us, may Allah reward you with good, what must she do?","['Praise be to Allah.The correct view is that she does not have to make up the missed prayers. If someone has an accident and loses consciousness, then he comes under the same heading as one who is insane or has an intellectual disability, so he does not have to make up missed prayers. If the period of unconsciousness becomes lengthy, then he is more akin to one who is insane or an intellectual disability, so he does not have to make up missed prayers. This is the correct scholarly view. But if the coma only lasted for two or three days, then the person is more like one who was asleep or fainted, so he should make up the missed prayers, as it was narrated from some of the Sahabah that they fell unconscious for a brief period, such as one or two days, so they made up the missed prayers.

190097,"“You pray two Rak`ahs, reciting in each Rak`ah Al-Hamd (i.e., Al-Fatihah) once and At-Tawhid (i.e., Al-Ikhlas) once, making the bowing and prostration lengthy. After finishing the prayer, say: ‘O Most Glorious, O One, O Most Generous, I turn to You by virtue of Muhammad Your Prophet, the Prophet of mercy, (blessings of Allah be upon him and his family); O Muhammad, O Messenger of Allah, I turn by virtue of you to Allah, my Lord and your Lord, the Lord of all things. I ask you, O Allah, to send blessings upon Muhammad and the members of his household, and I ask You for a breath of mercy from You, quick relief, and abundant provision, so that I may put my affairs in order, pay off my debts and support my dependents.’” Is this Hadith authentic?","['Praise be to Allah.Is there a specific Du`a to increase provision?\nIn the authentic Sunnah there is no known prayer specifically for asking for increased provision. The prayer described in the question with this Du`a (supplication) is an innovated prayer; it comes under the heading of prescribing in religion something that Allah has not prescribed, and introducing innovation (Bid`ah) that is prohibited.\xa0\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Ahl As-Sunnah wal-Jama‘ah consider any action or word that is not proven from the Companions to be an innovation (Bid`ah), because if it were something good, they would have done it before us. They did not omit any good attribute but they hastened to do it or attain it.” (Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 7/278-279)\nShaykh Salih Al-Fawzan (may Allah preserve him) said:\xa0\n“The innovations that have been introduced in the area of worship nowadays are many. But the basic principle with regard to acts of worship is Tawqif [i.e., they can only be known through divine Revelation and sound texts of Hadith, with no room for personal opinion], so no acts of worship are prescribed except on the basis of evidence. Anything for which there is no evidence is an innovation (Bid`ah), because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does an action that is not part of this matter of ours will have it rejected.” (Al-Bukhari and Muslim). The acts of worship that are done nowadays for which there is no evidence are very many."" (Kitab At-Tawhid, p. 160 )\nIs it permissible to call upon the Messenger of Allah?\nThe words of the worshipper in this Du`a after this innovated prayer, “I turn to You by virtue of Muhammad Your Prophet , the Prophet of mercy, (blessings of Allah be upon him and his family); O Muhammad, O Messenger of Allah, I turn by virtue of you to Allah…” are words that are not permissible, and come under the heading of innovated Tawassul (means of seeking to draw closer to Allah) that is forbidden.\xa0\nAnyone who calls upon the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) after his death , or who calls upon anyone else among the dead to ward off harm or bring benefits has committed major Shirk (associating partners with Allah) that puts one beyond the pale of Islam, and he has to repent to Allah, may He be Exalted.\xa0\nHow to increase provision in Islam\nThere are some means of increasing provision that are prescribed in Islam, which we shall highlight here, so as to adopt the means that are prescribed and warn against innovations in religion. These include:\xa0\n\nIstighfar (praying for forgiveness): Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n“I said (to them): Ask forgiveness from your Lord; Verily, He is Oft-Forgiving; He will send rain to you in abundance; And give you increase in wealth and children, and bestow on you gardens and bestow on you rivers.”\xa0[Nuh 71:10-12]\xa0\n\nUpholding ties of kinship: Al-Bukhari (2067) and Muslim (2557) narrated from Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever would like his provision to be increased and his life to be extended , should uphold the ties of kinship.”\xa0\n\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“The term ‘His provision to be increased’ means to be expanded and made abundant or, it was said, to be blessed (Barakah).”\n\nGiving a great deal of charity: Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n\n“Say: Truly, my Lord enlarges the provision for whom He wills of His slaves, and (also) restricts (it) for him, and whatsoever you spend of anything (in Allah’s Cause), He will replace it. And He is the Best of providers.”\xa0[Saba’ 34:39]\xa0\nMuslim (2588) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Charity does not decrease wealth.”\xa0\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“The scholars mentioned two meanings of this Hadith, one of which is that (the wealth) will be blessed (as a result of giving charity ) and harm will be warded off from it, so the apparent decrease will be compensated for by means of hidden blessing. This is something that is well known from experience. The second is that even if it appears to be decreased outwardly, there will be compensation for that in the reward that results from it, and it will be increased manifold.”\xa0\n\nBeing mindful of Allah and fearing Him: Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n“And whosoever fears Allah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty). And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine.”\xa0[At-Talaq 65:2-3]\xa0\n\nPerforming Hajj and `Umrah often, following one with the other: At-Tirmidhi (810) narrated that `Abdullah ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Make the Hajj and `Umrah follow each other closely, for they remove poverty and sins as the bellows removes the dross of iron, gold and silver, and an accepted Hajj brings no less a reward than Paradise.” (It was classed as authentic by Al-Albani)\xa0\nDu`a (supplication) : It was narrated by Ibn Majah (925) from Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to say, after he said the Salam at the end of Fajr prayer: “Allahumma inni as’aluka `ilman nafi`an, wa rizqan tayyiban, wa `amalan mutaqabbalan (O Allah, I ask you for beneficial knowledge,\xa0good (lawful) provision, and accepted good deeds).” (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah)\xa0\n\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/190097/how-to-increase-provision
