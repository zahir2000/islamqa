220923,"In our country, people cook special food on the fortieth day after the death of their loved one. We regard this as haram, and therefore we do not go to such gatherings. But they – meaning our neighbours, the family of the deceased – sent the food to our house and give it to our children. Because I do not speak their language and I do not want to hurt their feelings, I took it and gave it to my paternal aunt, my husband’s mother, and I told her that it is haram and that she has to get rid of it, either by giving it to her neighbours or by giving it back to those who made it. But instead of doing either of these things, she gave it to her husband who thinks that practising this custom is haram, but the food is not haram, so there is nothing wrong with eating it. I would like to know the ruling on the food itself: is it permissible to eat it or not? If it is not permissible to eat it, then what should we do with it? Is there any sin on me for giving it to someone else who ate from it?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe Sunnah is for neighbours, relatives and friends to hasten to make food and give it to the family of the deceased, because it is proven from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that when news reached him of the death of his paternal cousin Ja‘far ibn Abi Talib (may Allah be pleased with him) in the Mu’tah campaign, he said: “Make food for the family of Ja’far, for there has come to them that which is preoccupying them.” Narrated and classed as hasan by at-Tirmidhi (998); also narrated by Abu Dawud (3132), and Ibn Majah (1610); classed as hasan by Ibn Kathir and Shaykh al-Albani.\nImam ash-Shafa‘i said: I like for the neighbours of the deceased, or his relatives, to make for the family of the deceased on the day or night that he died food that will suffice them, because that is Sunnah and kind gesture, and it is the practice of good people before us and after us.""(Al-Umm\xa01/317).\nIbn Qudamah said: It is recommended (mustahabb) to make food for the family of the deceased and send it to them, to help them and console them, for perhaps they are distracted by their calamity, and by those who come to offer their condolences, from making food for themselves.""(Al-Mughni\xa0 3/496).\nSecondly:\nThe majority of scholars regard it as disliked (makruh) for the family of the deceased to make food to offer to people, whether that is on the day of the death or the fourth day thereafter, or the tenth or fortieth day, or on the one-year anniversary of the death. All of that is blameworthy.\nIbn Humam al-Hanafi said: It is disliked [makruh] for the family of the deceased, to offer food, because that [offering food] is prescribed on happy occasions, not on sad occasions, and it is a reprehensible innovation.""(Fath al-Qadir\xa0 2/142).\nAl-Hattab al-Maliki said: With regard to the family of the deceased making food and people gathering to eat it, this is disapproved of by a number of scholars, who regarded it as an innovation, because there is no religious text that refers to that, and this is not an occasion for feasting.""(Mawahib al-Jalil fi Sharh Mukhtasar Khalil\xa0 2/228).\nAn-Nawawi said: With regard to the family of the deceased making food and calling people together to eat it, nothing has been narrated concerning that [in the religious texts], and it is an innovation that is not approved of.""(Rawdat at-Talibin\xa0 2/145).\nIbn Qudamah said: As for the family of the deceased making food for people, it is disliked, because it is a further burden on them in addition to their calamity and and it is a further preoccupation when they are already preoccupied with grief; moreover, it is similar to what the people of the Jahiliyyah used to do. End quote from al-Mughni (3/497).\nShaykh al-Islam said: With regard to the family of the deceased making food and inviting people to eat it, that is not prescribed in Islamic teachings; rather it is an innovation. In fact, Jarir ibn ‘Abdillah said: We used to regard gathering with the family of the deceased and their making food for the people as coming under the heading of wailing. Rather what is recommended, if someone dies, is to make food for his family.""(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa\xa0 24/316).\nIn Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah (9/145) it says: With regard to the family of the deceased making food for people and taking that as a custom, that is unknown in what we know [of what was narrated] from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and the Rightly Guided Caliphs who succeeded him. Rather it is an innovation, and should be abandoned, because it adds to the burden on the family of the deceased, and because of what it involves of imitating the actions of the people of the Jahiliyyah and turning away from the Sunnah of the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and the Rightly Guided Caliphs who succeeded him (may Allah be pleased with them). End quote.\nAnd they said: As for what the family of the deceased do nowadays, of offering dinner and commemorating the fortieth day after the death, there is no basis for that. If they want to give charity on behalf of the deceased by offering food, they should not allocate a specific day for that, and if they give charity to the poor in the form of cash, that is better for them, because it is further removed from showing off, it is more beneficial for the poor, and it is further removed from imitating non-Muslims.""(Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah\xa09/149).\nThe view that it is makruh (disliked) is the view of the four imams, as we have quoted their views above. Some of the scholars are of the view that it is haram.\nIbn Muflih said: It was said that it is haram. Ahmad regarded it as disliked (makruh) and said: I do not like it. Ja‘far narrated: He did not grant them a concession allowing it. Al-Marrudhi narrated: It is one of the actions of the Jahiliyyah, and he emphatically denounced it.""(Al-Furu‘\xa0 3/408).\nThe view that it is haram becomes more certain if the price for the food is taken from the wealth of orphans and minors [i.e., their share of the estate].\nShaykh Muhammad ibn Ibrahim Al ash-Shaykh said: The jurists (may Allah have mercy on them) stated that it is disliked for the family of the deceased to make food for people, and that this is food offered to those who come to give their condolences, which is prohibited.\nIf the food is paid for from the estate of the deceased, and among the heirs there are minors, or people who are absent, or people who did not approve of that, then it is haram, because it comes under the heading of disposing of someone else’s wealth without lawful permission.""(Fatawa wa Rasa’il ash-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibrahim\xa0 2/232).\nShaykh Muhammad al-Mukhtar ash-Shinqiti said: To expect the family of the deceased to go to the trouble of making food is contrary to the Sunnah and is more akin to innovation. In fact, it may be haram if it is paid for from the wealth of the orphans and minors, as some ignorant people do, when they approach the estate of the deceased, to which orphans and widows have rights, and take money from it to spread rugs and carpets, and pay for the costs of the condolence gathering, as if a wedding is taking place, so they go to the trouble of organising that and harm the family of the deceased. Therefore this food comes under the heading of consuming orphans’ wealth wrongfully, and Allah says of those who do that: { Indeed, those who devour the property of orphans unjustly are only consuming into their bellies fire. And they will be burned in a Blaze} [an-Nisa’ 4:10]. We ask Allah to keep us safe and sound.""(Sharh Zad al-Mustaqni‘\xa0 86/15).\nAnd he said: As for the family of the deceased making food as charity on behalf of the dead and the like, which some people unfortunately do nowadays, this is something of which the scholars said that it is not prescribed, and if it is done using the orphans’ wealth, then it is even more prohibited, and the guardian of the orphans’ wealth should be made liable for the money that he spent. If he spent the orphan’s wealth on such matters, then he must be made liable for it, because the orphan is not responsible for this food and it is not permissible to use his wealth for this expense which is not prescribed according to Islamic teachings. So the one who spent it must be made liable for the money and must offer compensation.""(Sharh Zad al-Mustaqni‘\xa0 86/17).\nThirdly:\nAn exemption is made from the ruling that it is disliked (makruh) in the case of making food for guests who come to stay with them, if the food is made by way of honouring the guests, and not because of the death.\nIbn Qudamah said: If there is a need for that, it is permissible, for perhaps people have come to attend the funeral from other cities and distant places and stayed overnight with them, and they have no option but to show them hospitality.""(Al-Mughni\xa0 3/497).\nShaykh Ibn Baz said: But if guests come to stay with the family of the deceased at the time of offering condolences, there is nothing wrong with them making food for them for the sake of offering hospitality. Similarly, there is nothing wrong with the family of the deceased inviting whomever they wish of neighbours and relatives to eat with them the food that has been given to them.""(Fatawa ash-Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baz\xa0 9/325).\nIn Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah (8/378) it says: With regard to the family of the deceased making food for people, that is contrary to the Sunnah and is in fact an objectionable deed … unless a guest is staying with them, in which case there is nothing wrong with it. End quote.\nShaykh Muhammad al-Mukhtar ash-Shinqiti said: Here there is an issue which is, unfortunately, widespread; it is the issue of a guest who stays with the family of the deceased. If there are guests, especially if they are relatives – such as cousins and siblings – who have come from afar and are staying with the person, and they are guests who are entitled to hospitality, so the host slaughters an animal to feed them, and does not do that because of the death or to give charity on behalf of the deceased; rather he does it by way of honouring his guests, there is nothing wrong with that, because this is something different from the matter we are discussing here. It has nothing to do with the offering of condolences; rather it comes under the heading of honouring guests, as enjoined by Allah and His Messenger. So he should honour his guest, and there is nothing wrong with that.""(Sharh Zad al-Mustaqni‘\xa0 86/15).\nFourthly:\nJust as it is disliked for the family of the deceased to make food for those who come to offer their condolences, it is also disliked to eat from the food that they have prepared for this purpose, and if the food was made using the money that belongs to heirs who are minors, then eating from it is haram.\nAl-Bahuti said: It is disliked to eat from their food, and if it was paid for from the estate when there are among the heirs one who cannot dispose of his own wealth or those who did not give permission for that, then it is haram to make it and haram to eat from it, because it was paid for from the wealth of one who does not yet have any authority to dispose of it or from the wealth of someone else, without his permission.""(Kashshaaf al-Qina‘\xa0 2/149).\nIbn Hajar al-Haytami said: What is customary of the family of the deceased making food in order to invite people to come and eat it is a reprehensible innovation, as is accepting such an invitation. End quote from Tuhfat al-Muhtaj (3/207).\nIn al-Fawakih ad-Dawani (1/285) it says: No one should eat from that food unless the one who made it was one of the heirs and was an adult of sound mind, in which case there is nothing wrong with eating from it.\nIn al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (16/44) it says: The jurists are unanimously agreed that it is disliked for the family of the deceased to host others, because that is prescribed on happy occasions, not on sad occasions.… The Hanbalis stated that it is disliked to eat from the food provided by the family of the deceased, and that if it was paid for from the estate and among those who are entitled to it is one who cannot dispose of his own wealth, then it is haram to make that food or to eat from it.\nThe Hanbalis and Shafa‘is stated that it is haram to prepare food for women who wail [for the deceased], because that is helping in sin. The Hanafis stated that it is disliked to prepare food on specific days, such as the first day, the third day, and one week after the death. End quote.\nConclusion:\nIt is disliked for the family of the deceased to make food for those who come to offer condolences to them, and it is disliked for the one who attends the condolence gathering to eat from that food. In fact, it is haram if the food was made using the wealth of orphans and minors.\nAs for the food that was given to you by the family of the deceased, you should have advised them and not accepted it, by way of deterring them from doing such a thing again. As you have accepted it, there is nothing wrong with you eating from it or giving it in charity to someone who needs it, because this food – even though it was disliked to make it – is not haram in and of itself, as it is not meat that was slaughtered unlawfully or any other kind of haram food. It is only disliked because of what is mentioned above about it being an innovated custom. As for the one to whom it was given, he did not participate in the innovation mentioned above.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/220923/ruling-on-eating-food-made-by-the-family-of-the-deceased-for-the-condolence-gathering-or-the-forty-day-anniversary-of-the-death
258910,"Is it normal for a Muslim to find it very difficult to do acts of worship and be unable to do them because of some fault in his character, such as cowardice, for example, or other problems, so he says to himself: if I truly knew who Allah is, I would be able to do this act of worship easily? And this is true; he begins his journey by learning about Allah through looking at and pondering the universe, so as to increase his faith, yet despite that those acts of worship remain difficult for him, so he becomes very sad for his helplessness and cowardice. But I realised that looking at and pondering the universe and the blessings of Allah on its own is not sufficient; rather there must also be supplication, because it is the key to divine help. Is thinking in this way to console myself correct? I hope you will give a clear answer.","['Praise be to Allah.There are many means of attaining divine help and being enabled to do acts of worship and find pleasure in them. One of the greatest of these means is what you mentioned of knowing and loving Allah, and calling upon Him in supplication.\n1.\xa0Knowing Allah cannot be attained only by looking at and pondering His visible signs. Rather it is also attained by studying the verses of His revelation, which means reading His book and reflecting upon it, and studying the Sunnah of His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him),which is also revelation from Allah, may He be exalted.\nThe more a person ponders and reflects on the verses of Allah, the more his heart will be filled with love for Him and knowledge of Him, and the more he will turn to Him. As a result of that, his faith and certainty will increase, and this will make it easier for him to do acts of worship, no matter how difficult they may seem. Hence the righteous offered their souls and lives in Allah’s cause.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{The believers are only those who, when Allah is mentioned, their hearts become fearful, and when His verses are recited to them, it increases them in faith; and upon their Lord they rely;\nThe ones who establish prayer, and from what We have provided them, they spend.\nThose are the believers, truly. For them are degrees [of high position] with their Lord and forgiveness and noble provision}\xa0[al-Anfal 8:2-4].\nThe companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to say: Come, let us believe for an hour – and they would remember Allah, may He be exalted.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Mu‘adh ibn Jabal would say to a man: Let us sit and believe and remember Allah, may He be exalted.\nAbu’l-Yaman narrated: Safwan told us, from Shurayh ibn ‘Ubayd, that ‘Abdullah ibn Rawahah would take one of his companions by the hand and say: Come, let us believe for an hour, for we are in a gathering of dhikr.""(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa\xa0 7/225).\n2.\xa0The more a person reflects on the signs of Allah in the universe, the more his heart will be filled with veneration and awe of Allah. Hence Allah calls us to examine these signs and reflect on them as He, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And on the earth are signs for the certain [in faith],\nAnd in yourselves. Then will you not see?}\xa0[adh-Dhariyat 51:20-21].\xa0\nQatadah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Whoever reflects on his own self will realise that the only reason why his joints are flexible is so that he can worship Allah.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And thus did We show Abraham the realm of the heavens and the earth that he would be among the certain [in faith]}\xa0[al-An‘am 6:75].\nThis indicates that reflecting on the signs of Allah in the universe increases faith and certainty.\nImam Abu Bakr Ibn al-‘Arabi al-Maliki (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Allah, may He be exalted, has commanded us to look at His signs and reflect on His creation in many verses of the Qur’an. He wanted us to increase in certainty thereby and make us more steadfast in affirming His oneness.\nIbn al-Qaasim narrated that Maalik said: It was said to Umm ad-Darda’: how did Abu’d-Darda’ spend his time? She said: Most of the time he would reflect and ponder. It was said to him: Do you think reflection is a good deed? He said: Yes; it is certain faith.\nIbn al-Musayyib was asked about praying between Zuhr and ‘Asr.\nHe said: That is not worship; rather worship is refraining from that which Allah has prohibited, and thinking and reflecting about the commands of Allah.\nAl-Hasan said: Reflecting for an hour is better than voluntary prayer at night (qiyam al-layl).""(Ahkam al-Qur’an\xa0 2/351).\n3.\xa0One of the means by which a person can increase his faith, turn to Allah, may He be exalted, and find joy and comfort in worshipping Him is looking at the blessings that Allah has bestowed upon him in his own self, his family and his wealth, for that will generate love, prompt gratitude and make worship easy for him.\nThe more a person’s love for his Lord increases, the more he will find pleasure in worship.\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The lover finds pleasure in serving his beloved, and doing all kinds of acts obedience to him. The stronger the love grows, the more perfect the pleasure of obeying and serving him will be. So let him measure his faith and love for Allah by this standard, and let him see whether he finds pleasure in serving Him as the lover finds pleasure in serving his beloved, or does he find it burdensome and when he does it, he finds it tedious and boring, and feels resentment? This is the measure of a person’s faith and love for Allah.\nOne of the righteous early generations said: I start to pray, and I feel distressed when I realise it will come to an end.\nHence the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “My delight has been made in prayer.” Whoever finds delight in a thing will not like to finish it or leave it, for he finds delight and comfort when he finds joy in worship and he has pleasure in his life.\nOne of the early generations said: I rejoice when night comes, because of what I find of pleasure in the night and I delight in conversing with the One Whom I love, focusing on worshipping Him and humbling myself before Him.\nAnd I feel distressed when dawn breaks, because during the day I am distracted from that.\nNothing is more pleasurable to the lover than serving and obeying his beloved.\nOne of them said: I struggled with prayer for twenty years, then I enjoyed it for twenty years.\nThis pleasure and delight in service is only attained by means of persistance, despite struggling with it and feeling tired in the beginning. So if a person persists patiently and is sincere in his patience, that will lead to him finding this pleasure.\nAbu Yazid said: I drove my nafs (self) weeping on the path to Allah and I kept driving it until it began to follow the path willingly and joyfully.\nThe one who continues doing acts of worship and striving in the way of Allah will be exposed to troubles and problems, and he will give up sometimes and feel tired sometimes, until he reaches this state [of enjoying worship].\nAt that time, he will find pleasure in his striving in worship, and he will feel anguish when he slows down or stops. So you will see that the most difficult thing for him is wasting his time or ceasing his striving.\nAnd there is no way that he can attain that level unless he has strong love for Allah.""(Tariq al-Hijratayn\xa02/697-698), ‘Alam al-Fawa’id edn.\n4.\xa0One of the greatest means of attaining divine help is asking of Allah, may He be exalted, and turning to Him. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) taught Mu‘adh to say: “Allahumma a‘ini ‘ala dhikrika wa shukrika wa husni ‘ibadatika (O Allah, help me to remember You, be grateful to You and worship You properly).”\nAbu Dawud (1522) and an-Nasa’i (1303) narrated from Mu‘adh ibn Jabal that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) took him by the hand and said: “O Mu‘adh, by Allah I love you. I advise you, O Mu‘adh, do not fail to say following every prayer: ‘Allahumma a‘ini ‘ala dhikrika wa shukrika wa husni ‘ibadatika (O Allah, help me to remember You, be grateful to You and worship You properly).’”\n5.\xa0You should realize that in addition to all of that, you must strive, persist and have patience, for whoever strives and struggles will find pleasure in worship.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{O you who have believed, persevere and endure and be on the alert and fear Allah that you may be successful}\xa0[Al ‘Imran 3:200]\n{And those who strive for Our sake - We will surely guide them to Our ways. And indeed, Allah is with the doers of good}\xa0[al-‘Ankaboot 29:69].\nMuhammad ibn al-Munkadir said: I strove against my nafs for forty years until I forced it to adhere to the straight path.\nThabit al-Bunani said: I struggled to make myself pray qiyam al-layl for twenty years, then I found pleasure in it for twenty years.\n6.\xa0One of the greatest means that will help a person to remedy that problem is to treat a thing with its opposite. So if someone is stingy, the way to deal with it is striving to make himself give, be generous with what he has and give up stinginess, little by little. Whoever is cowardly, the remedy is training himself to be patient and courageous, and making himself speak the truth and act in accordance with it, and put up with the consequences of doing so. Whoever is talkative, talks too much and indulges in false speech should restrain his tongue, rein it in and watch what he says.\nThe Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whatever I have of wealth I will never withhold from you. Whoever strives to maintain his dignity (by not asking of people), Allah will help him to maintain his dignity; whoever strives to be patient, Allah will bestow patience upon him; whoever acts as if he has no need of other people, Allah will suffice him. And no one is ever given anything better and more abundant than patience.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (6470) and Muslim (1053).\nIt was narrated that Abu’d-Darda’ said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Knowledge is only acquired by learning and forbearance is only attained by striving to show forbearance. Whoever seeks what is good will be granted it, and whoever seeks protection against evil will be protected against it.”\nNarrated by at-Tabarani in al-Awsat (2663) and others; classed as hasan by al-Albani.\n7.\xa0Another means of attaining that is refraining from sins and acts of disobedience, for they form a barrier between a person and his Lord, and they are among the causes of being deprived of provision and goodness.\nA man said to Ibrahim ibn Adham: I cannot pray qiyam al-layl; prescribe a remedy for me.\nHe said: Do not disobey Allah during the day and He will cause you to stand before Him during the night. Standing before Allah in the night is one of the greatest honours, and the disobedient sinner is not deserving of that honour.\nA man said to al-Hasan al-Basri: O Abu Sa‘id, when I go to bed I feel that I am in good health and I would like to pray qiyam al-layl, and I prepare water for my wudu’. Why am I not able to get up?\nAl-Hasan said: Your sins are holding you back.\nAnd he said (may Allah have mercy on him): If a person commits sin, he will be deprived of praying qiyam at night and fasting during the day as a result.\nAl-Fudayl ibn ‘Iyad said: If you cannot get up to pray qiyam at night and fast during the day, then you should realize that you have been deprived and shackled; your sins have shackled you.\n8.\xa0Another thing that will help one to do acts of worship and make them easier is reading of what Allah has prepared for those who worship Him of immense reward; reading the biographies of the righteous; and finding out about the worship of those who love Allah. See: at-Targhib wa’t-Tarhib by al-Mundhiri; al-Matjar ar-Rabih fi Thawab al-‘Amal as-Salih by ad-Dimyati; Sifat as-Safwah by Ibn al-Jawzi; and Siyar A‘lam an-Nubala’ by adh-Dhahabi.\nWe Allah to help and guide us and you.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/258910/ways-of-making-it-easier-to-do-acts-of-worship-and-find-pleasure-in-them
