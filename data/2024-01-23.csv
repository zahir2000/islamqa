131473,"My grandfather died before his father [my great-grandfather], and my grandfather’s sons, including my father and my paternal uncles, did not inherit anything from their grandfather. The sons of my great-grandfather inherited, and when we asked them to give us some of the inheritance, or we asked why we did not receive anything of the estate, they said: Your grandfather died before his father, therefore you do not inherit. Furthermore, they said that for us to inherit, all the sons of my great-grandfather must have died, but in fact they are still alive. My question is: is their argument sound? Is it true that we cannot inherit according to Islamic shari‘ah?","['Praise be to Allah.One of the conditions of inheritance is that the designated heir must be alive after the death of the testator [the one who leaves an estate behind], hence your father and paternal uncles would have inherited from their father if he died during their lifetime and left wealth to be inherited.\nBut as the great-grandfather has died, his living heirs – who are his children – inherit from him, and the children of his deceased son cannot inherit, because they are prevented from doing so in this case.\nThe guideline is that in the case of inheritance, if there is a son or sons, and also grandsons, the grandsons are prevented from inheriting by the presence of their paternal uncles, and they do not inherit anything.\nBased on that, what you were told is true, so there is no share of inheritance for your father and paternal uncles from your great-grandfather, so long as he has sons who are still alive.\nShaykh ‘Abdullah ibn Jibreen (may Allah preserve him) was asked: Can grandsons inherit from their grandfather, if their father died before their grandfather? If the answer is no, why is that?\nHe replied: In this context, grandsons refers to sons of sons, not sons of daughters. If their father dies before his father [their grandfather], they do not inherit from their grandfather if he leaves behind a son or sons, because the son is closer [to the deceased] then the son’s son. If the grandfather leaves behind no sons, not even one, and he only leaves behind daughters, then the grandsons receive what is left after the daughters are given their shares of inheritance. Similarly, the grandchildren may inherit from their grandfather, if he left behind no sons and no daughters, because they take the place of his own children, so each male will receive the share of two females.""(Majallat al-Haras al-Watani (issue no. 264, 1/6/2004).\nBut these grandchildren may still receive something from their grandfather’s estate in two ways:\nThe first way is if the grandfather made a bequest to them before he died, bequeathing one third or less of his estate. He may do this if he has a great deal of wealth, and this bequest is obligatory to some of the scholars and recommended (mustahabb) according to many of them.\nThe evidence for that is the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Prescribed for you when death approaches [any] one of you if he leaves wealth [is that he should make] a bequest for the parents and near relatives according to what is acceptable - a duty upon the righteous}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:180].\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: What we learn from this verse is that it is obligatory to make a bequest for parents and near relatives, for one who is leaving behind a lot of wealth, because Allah, may He be exalted, says: {Prescribed for you}. The scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) differed as to whether this was abrogated by the verses on inheritance or it is still applicable, as the verses on inheritance are more specific. There are two views, and most of the scholars are of the view that it is abrogated, but the more correct view is it has not been abrogated, because it may be understood as specifying. Hence it may be said that the words {for the parents and near relatives} apply specifically to cases where they have an allocated share, meaning that if they have an allocated share, no bequest can be made to them, because what Allah has allocated to them of inheritance is sufficient. Thus the verse remains general in meaning and refers to those other than the heirs who have been given allocated shares.\nWe also learn that it is permissible for the individual to make a bequest of whatever he wants, but this is restricted by the hadith of Sa‘d ibn Abi Waqqas (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which he said to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): Can I give two thirds of my wealth [as a bequest]? He said: “No.” He said: One half? He said: “No.” He said: One third? He said: “One third, and one third is still a lot.” Agreed upon. Based on this, the bequest should not be greater than one third of the wealth, so the verse is restricted by the hadith.\nWe also learn that the obligation to make a bequest only applies in the case of one who is leaving behind a great deal of wealth, because Allah, may He be exalted, says: {if he leaves wealth}. As for one who is leaving behind a small amount of wealth, it is best for him not to make bequests if he has heirs, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to Sa‘d ibn Abi Waqqaas (may Allah be pleased with him): “If you leave your heirs independent of means, that is better than leaving them dependent and asking of people.” Agreed upon.""(Tafsir Surat al-Baqarah\xa02/306).\nThe second way is for the paternal uncles to give them something of their shares of inheritance as a gift, to be distributed to them.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/131473/grandchildren-do-not-inherit-from-their-grandfather-if-he-has-a-son-or-sons-still-living
9232,"I am in love with a Muslim. We do plan to be married soon, as long as his parents accept it. I plan to pronounce Shahadah soon, and begin the rituals of cleansing and prayer. My question is, what things can I do that will make me a good and virtuous wife to him? What manners should I have and what practices should I follow? What rules are there about women in the mosque? Also, how should I read the Holy Book?","['Praise be to Allah.Welcome to Islam message\nWe praise Allah Who has lighted the path of truth for you and enabled you to become convinced of Islam which is the true religion. All you have to do now is to utter the Two Testimonies of Faith (the Shahadatayn) in order to set your affairs straight, and you will be granted divine support in this world and in the Hereafter. So hasten to take this step and I ask Allah to make you steadfast in adhering to His religion. Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.\xa0\nHow to be a righteous wife in Islam\nIn order to be a righteous wife with whom Allah is pleased, we advise you, after obeying Allah, to obey your husband so long as he does not tell you to do anything wrong or sinful, for a wife’s obedience towards her husband is one of the most important principles of marriage propagated in Islam.\xa0\nMu`adh ibn Jabal (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If I were to command anyone to prostrate to anyone else, I would have commanded women to prostrate to their husbands, because of the husband’s great rights. No woman can find the sweetness of faith until she fulfils her husband’s rights , even if he calls her to him when she is atop her camel.” \xa0\nAl-Haythami (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0“This was narrated in full by Al-Bazzar and in part by Ahmad, and the men of its Isnad [chain of narration] are the men of sahih.” (Majma` Az-Zawa’id, 4/309)\xa0\nGive up the bad customs that you used to engage in before Islam\xa0\nAfter that you have to give up the bad customs that you used to engage in before your Islam, that go against Islam and its commandments.\xa0\n\nThat includes Tabarruj (wanton display) , being unveiled and not wearing proper Islamic Hijab – if you are one of those who do not wear Islamic dress. You also have to give up such customs of the disbelievers as mixing with men, and making friends with men who are not your Mahrams.\xa0\nYou have to get used to Muslim customs and the commands of their religion which teaches that the Muslim woman is to be protected and not to wander about half naked in the marketplaces and places where there is free mixing with men, because that offends her husband’s honour. \xa0\n\nLifestyle after conversion to Islam\nWith regard to the way of life that you have to follow, that is by adhering to the commands enjoined by Allah and by avoiding the things that Allah has forbidden; that includes praying and fasting regularly and remembering Allah in all situations. In all of that it will help if you read the Quran and useful books which describe Islam and its teachings.\xa0\nEtiquettes of entering the mosque\nWith regard to the guidelines on women entering the mosque , they are as follows:\xa0\n\nShe should not go out wearing perfume , adornment or make-up. This does not apply only to going out to the mosque, rather whenever she goes out of her house, it is prohibited for her to go out wearing makeup. Her purpose in going out of the house should be to pray to Allah or to attend a lesson from which she can learn the rulings of her religion.\xa0\n\nAbu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not prevent the female slaves of Allah from going to the mosques of Allah , but let them go out not wearing perfume.”\xa0(Narrated by Abu Dawud, 565; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud, 529)\xa0\n\nIt is Sunnah for the Muslim, when he leaves his house and heads towards the mosque, to recite the Du`a for walking to the mosque:\xa0\n\n`Abdullah ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “… Then the Mu’adhdhin gave the call to prayer, and he (the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)) came out, saying, ‘Allahumma aj`al fi qalbi nuran wa fi lisani nuran waj’al fi sam’i nuran waj’al fi basari nuran waj`al min khalfi nuran wa min amami nuran waj`al min fawqi nuran wa min tahti nuran, Allahummah a`tini nuran (O Allah, place with my heart light, and upon my tongue light, and within my ears light and within my eyes light, and place behind me light and in front of me light and above me light and beneath me light, O Allah, bestow upon me light).”\xa0(Narrated by Muslim, 763)\xa0\n\nWhen one enters the mosque, one should enter with his right foot first, and say the words that were narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him):\xa0\n\nAbu Humayd or Abu Usayd (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When any one of you enters the mosque, let him say: Allahumma iftah li abwab rahmatika (O Allah, open to me the gates of Your mercy), and when he leaves let him say, Allahumma inni as’aluka min fadlika (O Allah, I ask You of Your bounty).”\xa0(Narrated by Muslim, 713)\xa0\nAccording to some reports, the words Bismillah, Allahumma salli ‘ala Muhammad (In the name of Allah, O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad) are added at the beginning of each.\xa0(See At-Tirmidhi, 314; Ibn Majah, 771. Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah, 625)\xa0\nHaywah ibn Shurayh (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “I met ‘Uqbah ibn Muslim and said to him, ‘I heard that you narrated from ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr ibn Al-‘As that when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) entered the mosque, he would say, “A’udhu Billah il-‘Athim wa bi wajhihi’l-karim wa sultanihi’l-qadim min Ash-shaytan ir-rajim (O Allah, I seek refuge in Your noble countenance and Your eternal authority from the accursed satan).”’ He said, ‘Is that all?’ I said, ‘Yes.’ He said, ‘And when he said that, the devil said, “He is protected from me for the whole day.”’”\xa0(Narrated by Abu Dawud, 466; classed as authentic by Shaykh Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud, 441)\xa0\n\nWhen the Muslim enters the mosque, he should not sit down until he has prayed two Rak`ahs to “greet the mosque ”.\xa0\n\nAbu Qutadah As-Sulami (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When any one of you enters the mosque, let him pray two Rak’ahs before he sits down.”\xa0(Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 443; Muslim, 714)\xa0\nAbu Dawud (455) narrated that `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded that mosques should be built in every neighbourhood, and that they should be cleaned and perfumed.\xa0(Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud, 437.)\xa0\n\nThe mosque should be cleaned and perfumed by those who are able to do it:\n\nAbu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The deeds of my Ummah, both good and bad, were shown to me, and I found that among the best of its deeds was removing a harmful thing from the road, and I found among the worst of its deeds leaving phlegm in the mosque and not burying it.” (Narrated by Muslim, 555)\xa0\n\nNot raising one’s voice in the mosque , even in reciting the Quran, because that may disturb one of the worshippers.\xa0\n\nAbu Sa’id (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) went into I’tikaf (seclusion or retreat for worship) in the mosque, and he heard them reciting Quran in loud voices. He pulled back the curtain and said: “Each one of you is conversing with his Lord, so do not disturb one another and do not raise your voices above one another in reciting the Quran” – or he said, “in prayer”.\xa0(Narrated by Abu Dawud, 1332; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud, 1183)\xa0\n\nHe should exit the mosque with the left foot first, and saying the Du`a narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).\xa0\n\nAbu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When any one of you enters the mosque, let him send blessings upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and say, Allahumma iftah li abwab rahmatika (O Allah, open to me the gates of Your mercy). And when he leaves let him send blessings upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and say, Allahumma i’simni min Ash-Shaytan ir-rajim (O Allah, protect me from the accursed satan).\xa0(Narrated by Ibn Majah, 773. This Hadith was classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Al-Jami’, 515)\xa0\nBenefits of reading the Quran\nWith regard to reading the Quran, you should read it a lot, because for every letter that you read you will have ten Hasanat (good deeds). It is permissible to recite the Quran with or without Wudu’, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to remember Allah in all situations. (Narrated by Muslim, 373) But it is better to do Wudu’ before reciting the Quran.\xa0\nMuhajir ibn Qunfudh (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that he came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) whilst he was urinating and greeted him with Salam, but he did not return the greeting until he had done wudu’. Then he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) apologised to him and said, “I did not want to mention Allah when I was not in a state of purity.”\xa0(Narrated by Abu Dawud, 17 – this version was narrated by him; Ibn Majah, 350. Classed as authentic by Shaykh Al-Albani in Sahih Al-Jami’, 2472)\xa0\nBut it is prohibited for one who is Junub (in a state of impurity following sexual activity) to recite the Quran. With regard to a menstruating woman, the correct view is that it is permissible for her to recite the Quran. Please see question no.\xa02564 .\xa0\nAll of that has to do with reciting the Quran without touching the Mus-haf. With regard to touching the Mus-haf , that is only permissible for one who has Wudu’, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “No one should touch the Quran except one who is pure.”\xa0(Narrated by Malik in Al-Muwatta’, 419; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Irwa’ Al-Ghalil, 122)\xa0\nIf the Muslim wants to read from the Mus-haf and he does not have Wudu’, he should hold the book with something in between, such as wearing gloves on his hands.\xa0\nIt is Sunnah for him to be humble and think of the meaning of the verses that he is reading. He should ask about the meaning if he finds the words difficult to understand, so that he will increase in knowledge whilst reading. After that he should strive to act in accordance with what he has learned and apply the rulings of the Quran.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9232/etiquettes-of-entering-the-mosque
182467,"I would like to ask you about food coupons (food stamps). Many Muslims receive food stamps in the USA, hence my question is: is it permissible to sell these stamps (coupons) and turn them into cash? Even though it is known that the government of the USA does not allow that, and the government says that the stamps are only for food. What is the ruling on the one who does that?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt is not permissible for the Muslim to cheat the system and do something illegal in order to get something that he is not entitled to, such as help in the form of cash or food, even if he is in need. Refraining from taking it is more appropriate and is better, especially if he is living in a non-Muslim country, because humiliation is more apparent there, and this is contrary to the dignity of the Muslim, as Islam encourages the Muslim to work and not be idle.\nSecondly:\nIn the case where a person needs to receive food help in any country, there is nothing wrong – in principle – with the recipient selling the coupons for cash or other goods or food other than what is written on the coupon. That is because the way in which he obtained these coupons was not by purchasing them; rather they were a gift. However, if the coupons are something that he bought, then it is not permissible for the buyer of the coupons to sell them before he obtains the food itself with the coupons [which he may then sell]. But if the coupons were a gift, then it is not stipulated that he should obtain the food [and then sell it]. Similar to that is the case of selling some share of inheritance before acquiring it. Thus it is known that it is permissible for the initial owner of the coupons to sell them for whatever he likes, whether it is cash or something else, but it is not permissible for the one who acquires them from him to sell them before he acquires food with the coupons [which he may then sell]. This is the more correct view, which is based on the fact that some of the Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) prohibited that. It is also the view of the Malikis and Shafa‘is.\nMuhammad ibn Rushd al-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It was said to Malik: What do you think, is it permissible for these people who are going to receive some food to sell it before they acquire it? He said: I do not see anything wrong with that, because the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever buys foodstuff should not sell it until he acquires it,” but in this case they did not buy it; rather it is something that they are going to be given…\nMuhammad ibn Rushd said:\nAnother proof is the hadith of Marwan ibn al-Hakam about the sukuk (financial certificates or bonds) that had become common during his time in Madinah – which people would sell to one another before acquiring what was written in the bond, so Zayd ibn Thabit and one of the companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) went to visit Marwan and said: Do you permit selling with riba, O Marwan? And he said: I seek refuge with Allah! What do you mean? They said: These sukuk (bonds) that people are selling to one another, and they sell them before acquiring what is written on them. So Marwan sent the guards to track them down then take them away from people and return them to their original owners (narrated by Muslim). These sukuk (bonds) these were promissory notes in which it was written that some wealth from the treasury would be given to some of the people of Madinah, then the people sold these promissory notes, and selling them was permissible in the first instance, but if the one who bought it then sold it before acquiring what was written on it, the sale of it by the second one was haram. So Marwan issued orders that the second transaction be cancelled, and the bonds be returned to the first purchaser, and he did not cancel the sale of these notes by the initial recipients.""(Al-Bayan wa’t-Tahsil\xa0 7/355-357).\nSee the words of an-Nawawi – and more details about this issue – in the answer to question no. 98713 .\nThirdly:\nFrom the above it becomes clear that there is nothing wrong – in principle – with selling food coupons (or food stamps) because they are not cash, and they were not obtained by purchasing them. So the most correct view is that it is permissible to sell them. But we say that it is not permissible to sell them for a different reason, which is that according to the regulations of the government that issues these food stamps, it is not allowed to sell them, and they are given to poor people so that they can obtain food with them. So using them for any purpose other than that for which they were issued is not allowed according to the system, based on the fact that they are a gift to which conditions are attached. Therefore it is a must to adhere to the system and the conditions stipulated by the giver, and they should not be disposed of by selling them.\nBut the one who obtains these food stamps may dispose of them by consuming the food, or selling them, or giving them to whomever he wants, so long as he obtained them in accordance with the conditions stipulated by the giver.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/182467/is-it-permissible-to-sell-food-coupons-food-stamps-when-it-is-illegal-to-do-that
232749,What does trust (Amanah) mean? What is the punishment for one who betrays the trust? How can he repent? What is the evidence for all of that from the Quran and Sunnah?,"['Praise be to Allah.Meaning of trust in Islam\nTrust (Amanah) – in Islamic terms – has two meanings, a general meaning and a specific meaning.\n\nThe general meaning has to do with all commands and prohibitions of Islam.\n\nAmong the evidence for that is the verse in which Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Truly, We did offer Al-Amanah (the trust or moral responsibility or honesty and all the duties which Allah has ordained) to the heavens and the earth, and the mountains, but they declined to bear it and were afraid of it (i.e. afraid of Allah’s Torment). But man bore it. Verily, he was unjust (to himself) and ignorant (of its results).” [Al-Ahzab 33:72]\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) quoted a number of opinions of the earlier scholars concerning the interpretation of the word Amanah, then he said:\n“There is no contradiction between any of these views; rather they are all in harmony and boil down to the idea that what it refers to is responsibility and acceptance of all the commands and prohibitions with the conditions attached. This means that if the individual fulfils that commitment, he will be rewarded, but if he fails to do so, he will be punished. Man accepted this commitment despite his weakness, ignorance and wrongdoing, except for those whom Allah guides and helps. And Allah is the source of strength.” (Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 6/489)\nThis meaning is the one that was favoured by Ibn Jarir At-Tabari (may Allah have mercy on him), when he said:\n“The view that is most likely to be correct is the view of those who said that what is meant by the Amanah here is all types of trust, whether they have to do with matters of religion or with people’s rights. That is because when Allah said “We did offer Al-Amanah (the trust or moral responsibility or honesty and all the duties which Allah has ordained)”, He did not single out some of the meanings of Amanah to the exclusion of others.” (Tafsir At-Tabari, 19/204-205)\nAl-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“The word Amanah includes all religious duties, according to the correct scholarly view, which is the view of the majority.”\xa0 (Tafsir Al-Qurtubi, 17/244)\nAnd Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Those who are faithfully true to their Amanah (all the duties which Allah has ordained, honesty, moral responsibility and trusts etc.) and to their covenants.” [Al-Mu’minoon 23:8]\nShaykh Muhammad Al-Amin Ash-Shinqiti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“The Amanah includes everything that Allah has entrusted to you and instructed you to take care of. That includes guarding your physical faculties from engaging in anything that is not pleasing to Allah, and guarding anything that has been entrusted to you that has to do with the rights and dues of others.” (Adwa’ Al-Bayan, 5/846)\n\nWith regard to the specific meaning of Amanah or trust:\n\nThere are numerous Mutwawatir Islamic texts which enjoin paying attention to trusts and fulfilling them, and not neglecting or betraying them. That is widely discussed in the books of the scholars and jurists, and is widely spoken of among people in general. Perhaps this is what the questioner meant when he asked about Amanah or trusts.\nBased on that, what is meant by Amanah or trust in this sense is everything that the individual is obliged to take care of, uphold and fulfil of the rights of others.\nTypes of trust in Islam\nThere are three well-known scenarios with regard to Amanah or trust:\n\nFinancial rights that are established by contracts and covenants , such as items left with a person for safekeeping, loans, hiring and rentals, and so on; and those concerning which there is no contract, such as found items and what people pick up of the lost property of others.\n\nIt says in Al-Mawsu‘ah Al-Fiqhiyyah Al-Kuwaitiyyah (6/236):\n“From researching the issue, it becomes clear that the jurists use the word Amanah in the following senses:\n\nIn the sense of an item that is left in the possession of the person to whom it was entrusted. This may be with regard to one of the following scenarios\n\n\na contract in which the Amanah is the primary focus, which is when an item is left with a person for safe keeping. This is more specific than Amanah, because every item that is left with a person for safekeeping is an Amanah, but the converse is not necessarily true\n(b) \xa0a contract in which the Amanah is implied, but it is not the primary focus; rather it is connected to it as a consequence, such as renting, borrowing, profit sharing, appointing someone to act as an agent, partnerships and collateral for loans.\n(c) cases in which no contract is involved, such as picking up lost property, or that which the wind blows into a neighbour’s house. Such cases are called Shar`i trusts.”\xa0\n\n\nKeeping people’s secrets\n\nAbu Sa‘id Al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “One of the most evil people before Allah on the Day of Resurrection will be a man who is intimate with his wife and she is intimate with him, then he broadcasts her secrets.”\nJabir ibn ‘Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If a man says something then turns away, it becomes a trust [which should not be disclosed by the one who heard it] .” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 4868. Also narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 1959, who said: This is a sound Hadith. It was classed as authentic by Al-Albani in As-Silsilah As-Sahihah, 4868)\n\nPositions of responsibility, whether social, public or private\n\nOne should carry out such positions of trust and responsibility on a basis of truth and justice. A position of rulership is a trust, a judicial position is a trust, a management position in any organisation is a trust, responsibility for a family is a trust, and the same applies to all positions of responsibility.\nAbu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When Amanah is neglected, then await the Hour.” He said: How would they be neglected, O Messenger of Allah? He (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When positions of authority are given to people who are not qualified for them, then await the Hour.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 6496)\nAbu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I said: O Messenger of Allah, will you not appoint me (to a position of authority)? He struck me on the shoulder with his hand and said: “O Abu Dharr, you are weak and it is a trust, and on the Day of Resurrection it will be a source of humiliation and regret, except for the one who takes it and fulfils all obligations and does all duties required.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1825)\nImportance of taking care of trusts in slam\nWhat is required in the case of both public and private trusts is to take care of the trust and fulfil it in the proper manner as required by Shari`ah, and it is prohibited to neglect it or betray it.\nAllah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“O you who believe! Betray not Allah and His Messenger, nor betray knowingly your Amanat (things entrusted to you, and all the duties which Allah has ordained for you).” [Al-Anfal 8:27]\n“Verily! Allah commands that you should render back the trusts to those, to whom they are due.” [An-Nisa’ 4:58]\nBetrayal of trusts is one of the signs of hypocrisy.\xa0 `Abdullah ibn `Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) said that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There are four characteristics, whoever has them all is a pure hypocrite, and whoever has one of them has one of the characteristics of hypocrisy, until he gives it up: when he makes a covenant he betrays it, when he speaks he lies, when he makes a promise he breaks it, and when he disputes he resorts to obscene speech.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 34 and Muslim, 58)\nIs betrayal of trust in Islam a major sin?\nBetrayal of trust is a sin, and in fact it is a major sin. Although it is a grave sin, the gate of repentance is open .\nAllah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Say: ""O My slaves who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allah, verily Allah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” [Az-Zumar 39:53]\n“And He it is Who accepts repentance from His slaves, and forgives sins, and He knows what you do.” [Ash-Shura 42:25]\nAbu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever repents before the sun rises from its place of setting, Allah will accept his repentance .” (Narrated by Muslim, 2703)\nSincere repentance means hastening to give up the sin, regretting it , and resolving not to go back to it. Then the sinner who neglected the trust should see whether the trust that he neglected has to do with the rights of Allah, in which case – in addition to repenting and seeking forgiveness – he should find out if there are any Shar`i requirements that he must fulfil in order to make up for this negligence, such as making up (missed obligatory deeds) or offering expiation.\nFor example, if someone neglects the trust of fasting, by breaking the fast deliberately during Ramadan, then – in addition to repenting – he must make up for the days that he did not fast. If his breaking of the fast was done by having intercourse, then he must offer the required expiation. This is also applicable to all other shar‘i matters that he neglected.\nBut if the trust that he betrayed has to do with the rights of people, then – in addition to what is explained above about repentance – he must also fulfil that right and give that person his dues, or ask him to let him off and forgive him.\nAbu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever has wronged someone with regard to his honour or anything else, let him ask for his forgiveness today, before (a Day when) there will be no Dinar and no Dirham, and if he has any righteous deeds to his credit, they will be taken from him, commensurate with the wrong that he did, and if he does not have any good deeds to his credit, some of the bad deeds of his opposite number will be taken and added to his burden.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 2449)\nConditions of repentance in Islam\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“The scholars said: Repentance is obligatory from all sins. If the sin has to do with a matter that is between the individual and Allah, may He be Exalted, and does not have to do with the rights of other people, then three conditions must be met :\n\nhe must give up the sin\nhe must regret what he has done\nhe must resolve never to go back to it.\n\nIf one of these three is missing, then his repentance is not valid.\nBut if the sin has to do with other people, then four conditions must be met: the three mentioned above, and he must also absolve himself of any wrongdoing and pay his dues to the one whom he wronged. If it is a matter of money and the like, then he must return it to him. If it has to do with punishment for slandering him and the like, he should submit to the punishment to be carried out on him, or seek that person’s forgiveness. If it is the matter of backbiting , he must ask him to forgive him for it.” (Riyadh As-Saliheen, p. 14)\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/232749/trust-in-islam
