495596,"If the wife’s daughter has a daughter through breastfeeding, is the mother’s husband a mahram to this daughter?","['Praise be to Allah.If a man marries a woman and consummates the marriage with her, if she has a daughter from another man, who is a stepdaughter (rabibah), this stepdaughter becomes a mahram for him [meaning that she is forbidden for him to marry] according to the text of the verse.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Prohibited to you [for marriage] are your mothers, your daughters, your sisters, your father\'s sisters, your mother\'s sisters, your brother\'s daughters, your sister\'s daughters, your [milk] mothers who nursed you, your sisters through nursing, your wives\' mothers, and your step-daughters under your guardianship [born] of your wives unto whom you have gone in. But if you have not gone in unto them, there is no sin upon you}\xa0[an-Nisa’ 4:23].\nThis prohibition also includes the daughter of this stepdaughter.\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nStepdaughters who are under the guardianship of husbands are prohibited for marriage. They are the daughters of their wives with whom they have consummated marriage. That also includes their daughters, their daughters’ daughters and sons’ daughters; they are all included in the word stepdaughters (raba’ib).""(Zad al-Ma‘ad 5/168).\nIt says in al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah al-Kuwaitiyyah (36/216):\nRaba’ib (stepdaughters) is the plural of rabibah. The stepchild of a man is the child of his wife from another man. The stepchild is called his rabib because he is the one who raises him (yurubbuhu), meaning that he takes care of him. The stepdaughter (rabibah) is the daughter of the wife, and she is prohibited for her mother’s husband to marry according to the verse, whether she is under his guardianship or not, and she is looked after like his own daughter in terms of compassion and care. With regard to the daughters of the stepdaughter and the daughters of the stepson being mahrams [and prohibited for marriage], that is established by scholarly consensus. End quote.\nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 163263 .\nAs the stepdaughter becomes a mahram to her mother’s husband because of ties through marriage, the daughter of the stepdaughter becomes a mahram to him because of lineage and the ties of kinship between her and her mother.\nShe also becomes a mahram to him if motherhood is not because of lineage and giving birth, rather it is because of breastfeeding, because of the general meaning of the text which indicates that what becomes mahram (forbidden for marriage) through breastfeeding is the same as that which becomes mahram through ties of kinship.\nAccording to the hadith, Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said regarding the daughter of Hamzah: “She is not permissible for me (to marry), for what becomes mahram (forbidden for marriage) through breastfeeding is the same as that which becomes mahram through lineage, and she is the daughter of my brother through breastfeeding.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (2645) and Muslim (1447).\nAl-Bukhari (5099) and Muslim (1444) narrated from ‘Amrah bint ‘Abd ar-Rahman that ‘A’ishah, the wife of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), told her that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was in her house, and she heard the voice of a man asking permission to enter Hafsah’s house. ‘A’ishah said: I said: O Messenger of Allah, there is a man asking permission to enter your house. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “I think it is So and so” – Hafsah’s paternal uncle through breastfeeding. ‘A’ishah said: O Messenger of Allah, if So and so – her paternal uncle through breastfeeding – were still alive, could he enter my house? The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Yes, for what becomes mahram (forbidden for marriage) through breastfeeding is the same as that which becomes mahram through birth.”\nThe view that breastfeeding is equal to lineage when there is a connection through marriage is the view of the majority of scholars.\nIbn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe prohibition on marriage to a mahram through breastfeeding extends as far as the same prohibition through lineage when there is a connection through marriage, either with regard to the man’s lineage, such as the wife of his father or son, or with regard to the woman’s lineage, such as her mother and daughter, and with regard to women to whom it is prohibited to be married at the same time because of the women’s lineage also, such as being married to two sisters, or to a woman and her paternal aunt or her maternal aunt, at the same time. All of that becomes prohibited through breastfeeding as it becomes prohibited through lineage, because it is included in the Prophet’s words, “what becomes mahram (forbidden for marriage) through breastfeeding is the same as that which becomes mahram through lineage.”\nAll of that becomes prohibited because of lineage, and some of it is because of the husband’s lineage and some of it is because of the wife’s lineage. This was stated by the leading scholars of the early generations, and no difference of opinion is known to have occurred among them concerning that. It was also stated by Imam Ahmad, who quoted as evidence the general meaning of the Prophet’s words, “what becomes mahram (forbidden for marriage) through breastfeeding is the same as that which becomes mahram through lineage.”(Jami‘ al-‘Uloom wa’l-Hikam\xa0 2/442).\nThus the mahram relationship may be established through breastfeeding as it may also be established through lineage.\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe Prophet’s words, “Breastfeeding makes prohibited what birth makes prohibited” imply that breastfeeding also makes permissible what birth makes permissible, according to scholarly consensus. This has to do with the prohibition on marriage and other issues connected to it. The mahram relationship with the one who was breastfed includes the children of the woman who breastfed him, and they are to be viewed as being like close relatives with regard to it being permissible to look at them, be alone with them and travel with them, but that does not include other rulings on motherhood such as inheritance, the obligation to spend on maintenance, the obligation to manumit a relative if one finds him enslaved and buys him, and rulings on giving testimony, paying blood money and waiving retaliatory punishments (qisas).""(Fath al-Bari (9/141).\nShaykh al-Islam had a different view concerning that. He favoured the view that it does not make him a mahram. He said in al-Ikhtiyarat (p.305):\nThe daughter of a stepdaughter is a mahram (prohibited for marriage) because she is a stepdaughter.\nHe also said in al-Ikhtiyarat (p. 308).\nThe mahram relationship that is established through marriage cannot be established on the basis of breastfeeding, so it does not become prohibited for a man to marry his wife’s mother or daughter through breastfeeding. End quote.\nIn ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘ (12/124), Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) stated that the view of Ibn Taymiyah is more likely to be correct, but he took a prudent approach and said that the view of the majority should be followed.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/495596/if-his-stepdaughter-has-a-daughter-through-breastfeeding-is-he-a-mahram-to-her

So long as the marriage contract fulfils the necessary requirements and conditions, then it is valid.\xa0\nShaykh Ibn Jibrin (may Allah preserve him) was asked: Is it essential for the marriage to be valid that a man should inform the woman he wants to marry that he is married to another one, if he is not asked about that? Are there any consequences if he denies it if he is asked?\xa0\nHe replied:\xa0\n“The man is not obliged to tell the woman or her family that he is married if they do not ask him, but that cannot usually be hidden because marriage is not usually done except after a period of enquiring and asking about each of the two partners and verifying that they are suitable.\xa0\nBut it is not permissible to conceal any facts, and if either party tells a lie and the other party acts on the basis of it, then there is the option of cancelling it.\xa0\nIf he says that he is not married and is lying about that, then the woman has the option of annulling the marriage.

504907,"I was in the mosque and I saw something wrong, but I was not able to advise this person, as there were many people there and that person left quickly. When I thought I had the opportunity to speak to him, someone stopped me and greeted me, and I was not able to advise that person. Is there any sin on me? If that is the case, how can I expiate my sin?","['Praise be to Allah.First of all, we congratulate you on your keenness to fulful the duty of advising your Muslim brothers and to do the religious duty of enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong. This is one of the most important religious duties about which many people have become heedless. It is one of the characteristics and merits for which Allah praises His slaves, and He has made it a symbol of goodness. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{You are the best nation produced [as an example] for mankind. You enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and believe in Allah}\xa0[Al ‘Imran 3:110].\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: What is meant is: You are the best of nations and the most beneficial to people. Hence He says: { You enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and believe in Allah}.… A man went to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) when he was on the minbar and said: O Messenger of Allah, who among the people is best? He said: “The best of the people are those who have most knowledge of Qur’an and are most mindful of Allah, and who enjoin people to do what is right and forbid them to do what is wrong, and are the most assiduous in upholding ties of kinship.""(Tafsir Ibn Kathir\xa0 2/93).\nIt was narrated that Abu Sa‘id al-Khudri said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “Whoever among you sees an evil action, let him change it with his hand (by taking action); if he cannot, then with his tongue (by speaking out); and if he cannot, then with his heart (by hating it and feeling it is wrong), and that is the weakest of faith.” Narrated by Muslim (49).\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Regarding the words “let him change it,” this is an instruction in the sense of it being obligatory, according to the consensus of the ummah. It is obligatory to enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong, according to the Qur’an, the Sunnah and the consensus of the ummah. This also comes under the heading of sincerity (nasihah), which is the religion.""(Sharh Sahih Muslim\xa0 2/22).\nWith regard to your being unable to catch up with the person whom you wanted to advise, there is no sin on you, because that did not happen due to any shortcoming on your part; rather it was because of something that happened and prevented you from catching up with the person in question.\nUndoubtedly obligations depend on being able to do them. If someone wants to do good, then is prevented from doing it, there is no blame on him for that. One of the established principles of Islamic teachings is that there is no obligation when one is unable to do it.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {Our Lord, do not impose blame upon us if we have forgotten or erred. Our Lord, and lay not upon us a burden like that which You laid upon those before us. Our Lord, and burden us not with that which we have no ability to bear. And pardon us; and forgive us; and have mercy upon us. You are our protector, so give us victory over the disbelieving people} [al-Baqarah 2:286].\nIn Sahih Muslim it says that Allah, may He be exalted, said: “I have granted that.”\nIt is the way of Allah, may He be glorified, that He does not burden anyone with more than he can bear.\nAsh-Shatibi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is proven in the books of usul that the condition of being accountable, or the reason for being accountable, is that the accountable person should be able to do what is enjoined. So whatever he is unable to do cannot be required of him, according to Islamic teachings.""(Al-Muwafaqat\xa0 2/171).\nThere is also the hope of reward for your intention. It was narrated from Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came back from the campaign to Tabuk and when he drew close to Madinah he said: “In Madinah there are people who, whenever you travelled any distance or crossed any valley, were with you.” They said: O Messenger of Allah, even though they are in Madinah? He said: “Even though they are in Madinah, because they were kept there by valid excuses.”\xa0 Narrated by al-Bukhari (4423).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/504907/is-he-sinning-if-he-is-not-able-to-advise-someone-who-has-done-something-wrong
46505,"A brother of ours has recently become Muslim. During his days of Jahiliyyah (ignorance – i.e., before he became Muslim), he earned a lot of money by dealing in drugs. He brought this money with him and opened a big bookstore and got married using this money. Recently he has been told that it is not permissible for him to give this money to charity, because Allah is Good and only accepts that which is good. Our question is, what should he do with this money, and how sound is what he has been told?.","['Praise be to Allah.We thank Allah Who has guided your friend to Islam. We ask Allah to make him steadfast and to guide him to that which is good for him in this world and in the Hereafter.\xa0\nBy His Grace and Mercy, Allah has made embracing Islam a cause to erase the sins that were committed before it. When a disbeliever becomes Muslim, Allah forgives all that he did when he was a non-Muslim, and he becomes cleansed of sin.\xa0\nMuslim (121) narrated that `Amr ibn Al-`As (may Allah be pleased with him) said: When Allah put Islam in my heart, I came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: “Give me your right hand so that I may swear allegiance to you.” He held out his hand and I withdrew my hand. He said, “What is the matter, O `Amr?” I said, “I want to stipulate a condition.” He said, “What do you want to stipulate?” I said, “That I will be forgiven.” He said, “Do you not know that Islam destroys that which came before it?”\xa0\n“Islam destroys that which came before it” means that it erases it and wipes it out. (Stated by An-Nawawi in Sharh Muslim)\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked a similar question, about someone who earned money by dealing in drugs before he became Muslim. He replied:\xa0\n“We say to this brother whom Allah has blessed with Islam after he had earned unlawful wealth: be of good cheer, for this wealth is permissible for him and there is no sin on him in it, whether he keeps it or gives it in charity, or uses it to get married, because Allah says in His Holy Book (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Say to those who have disbelieved, if they cease (from disbelief), their past will be forgiven. But if they return (thereto), then the examples of those (punished) before them have already preceded (as a warning)”\xa0[Al-Anfal 8:38]\nThis means all that has passed, in general terms, is forgiven. But any money that was taken by force from its owner must be returned to him. But money that was earned by agreements between people, even if it is unlawful, like that which is earned through Riba (interest)or by selling drugs, etc. it is permissible for him when he becomes Muslim because Allah says, “Say to those who have disbelieved, if they cease (from disbelief), their past will be forgiven”. And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to `Amr ibn Al-`As when he became Muslim: “Do you not know that Islam destroys that which came before it?”\xa0\nMany of the non-Muslims became Muslim after they had killed Muslims, but they were not punished for what they had done. So tell this brother that his wealth is permissible and there is no sin in it; he may give it in charity and use it to get married. As for what he has been told about it not being permissible for him to give it in charity, there is no basis for that.” (Liqa’at Al-Bab Al-Maftuh, /373-374)\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 14246 , 219679 , 34171 , 372709 , 264534 , 114 , 11819 , and 2585 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/46505/are-all-sins-forgiven-after-converting-to-islam
