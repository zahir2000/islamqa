445870,What is the ruling on using a derma pen while fasting?,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe Dermapen is a small, portable device similar to a pen, consisting of several sterile fine needles that puncture the skin and cause what is known as a dermal shock with the aim of treating various skin diseases and disorders. Therefore, the term Dermapen is derived from the word Dermatology and Pen.\nThe Dermapen belongs to the microneedling technique, which is a procedure that uses small needles to puncture the skin for therapeutic purposes, to enhance collagen production and the formation of new skin tissue for fresher and smoother skin, and to treat multiple skin problems.\nThe Dermapen is distinguished by being a portable cylinder that does not hinder or restrict movement, and it is a device with adjustable depth so that it is not too deep in sensitive areas, and the surgical needles can be disposed of after the session for the safety of the patient.\nThe Dermapen consists of 12 fine needles that puncture the upper layer of the skin.\nThe skin responds by healing itself by enhancing the production of collagen and elastin in the treated area, which stimulates the growth of new tissues that treat various skin problems and gives the face freshness and smoothness.\nSee:\nDermapen for the face: Your comprehensive guide - Webteb (webteb.com)\nSecondly:\nThere is no objection to using this technique if it is free from harm; because the basic principle is permissibility.\nSee what we have presented on the ruling on the use of the Dermaroller, in the answer to question number (323723 )\nThirdly:\nThe use of the Dermapen and the Dermaroller has no effect on fasting; because nothing enters the body through the skin, let alone reaches the cavity, and no blood comes out to be compared with cupping for those who deem the fast invalidated by it.\nPuncturing the skin with needles is not something that invalidates the fast, nor do injections with needles invalidate the fast, unless the injection is with a nourishing liquid.\nIt is stated in the resolution of the Islamic Fiqh Academy regarding matters that invalidate the fast:\n""The following matters are not considered to invalidate the fast: ...\n8- Therapeutic injections, whether subcutaneous, intramuscular, or intravenous, except for nourishing fluids and injections...\n11- Things that enter the body through absorption from the skin such as fats, ointments, and therapeutic skin patches loaded with medicinal or chemical substances.\n12- Inserting a catheter (a fine tube) into the arteries for imaging or treating the heart vessels or other organs.\n13- Inserting an endoscope through the abdominal wall to examine the viscera or perform surgery on them.\n14- Taking samples (biopsies) from the liver or other organs unless accompanied by the administration of solutions...\n16- The entry of any instrument or therapeutic materials into the brain or spinal cord.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/445870/using-derma-pen-during-fasting
170025,"If Iblis was not one of the angels, why was he commanded to prostrate to Adam along with the angels?","['Praise be to Allah.Undoubtedly, when Allah, may He be Exalted, commanded the angels to prostrate to Adam , this command was also addressed to Iblis, as Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“…except Iblis (Satan), he refused to be of those who prostrate.(Allah) said: `What prevented you (O Iblis) that you did not prostrate, when I commanded you?’” (Al-A`raf 7:11-12]\xa0\nThe scholars have spoken about the reason why the command to prostrate to Adam was addressed to Iblis even though he was not one of the angels ; they stated that the reason for that was that he was similar to the angels in their outward deeds.\xa0\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said (1/105):\xa0\nThe conclusion is that when Allah, may He be Exalted, commanded the angels to prostrate to Adam, He included Iblis in that because, even though he was not one of them , he was imitating them and doing deeds like theirs. Hence he was included in what was addressed to them, and he was condemned for going against the command.”\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Tafsir Surat Al-Baqarah (1/127):\xa0\n“If someone were to say: there is something confusing in this verse, which is that when Allah, may He be Exalted, says that He commanded the angels to prostrate, He says that they all prostrated except Iblis, and it would appear to mean that Iblis was one of them, but that is not the case.\xa0\nThe answer to that is that Iblis shared with them their outward deeds, so the command included him on the basis of his outward deeds.”\nSomething similar was also said by At-Tahir ibn `Ashur (may Allah have mercy on him) in his Tafsir, At-Tahrir wat-Tanwir (1/409).\xa0\nWhat we are obliged to believe is that the command to prostrate to Adam was addressed to Iblis just as it was addressed to the angels, and this is what the Quran clearly says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“(Allah) said: `What prevented you (O Iblis) that you did not prostrate, when I commanded you?’” [Al-A`raf 7:12]\xa0\nAs for the reason why this command was addressed to him, Allah knows best.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/170025/why-was-iblis-commanded-to-prostrate-to-adam
291935,"I am suffering from a spiritual illness, and I need to drink a large amount of Ruqyah water on an empty stomach to heal. Is it permissible for me to break my fast in Ramadan, knowing that I have exams during Ramadan, and the illness hinders my results?","['Praise be to Allah.Any ill person for whom fasting is difficult or causes a delay in recovery, or if the treatment requires daytime administration based on the prescription of a skilled physician, is permitted to break their fast during Ramadan and must make up the missed days later.

End quote.\nDrinking water over which Ruqyah has been recited on an empty stomach can be achieved by the fasting person if they drink it at Iftar, and it is not necessary to be in the morning; therefore, we do not see that this excuse justifies breaking the fast during the daytime in Ramadan.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/291935/permissibility-of-not-fasting-due-to-need-of-ruqyah-water-on-an-empty-stomach
189853,"I have an important, genuine and serious query. If you could please reply back ASAP that will be great and relieve me off the burden.
1) last Ramadan, my husband got weaken with his self-control(intercourse) and during the condition of fasting, we both did it. At that time, I didn’t know much in detail, so after Ramadan 20111 finished, we made up/compensated for our fasts & astaghfaar from Allah. I didn’t know about kaffara then.
2) this year Ramadan 2012, again during the condition of fasting, my husband ejaculated before doing the intercourse. I did prohibited him that we shouldn’t do it but obviously its something you have to exercise self control and control and put reins on your desires. I read much about it and still haven’t come to any conclusion.","['Praise be to Allah.Can you have intercourse while fasting?\nIt should be understood that intercourse during the day in Ramadan , for one who is fasting and is staying at home (i.e., not travelling), is a grave sin and what one must do is repent from it by praying a great deal for forgiveness, regretting it, acknowledging that it is a sin, and feeling sad for having done it.\xa0\nOne should also do a lot of acts of obedience and worship, and resolve not to go back to that sin.\xa0\nConsequences of having intercourse while fasting\nIn addition, there are five consequences of having intercourse while fasting:\xa0\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Incurring sin\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Rendering the fast invalid\n3.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Obligation to refrain from eating and drinking for the rest of the day\n4.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Obligation to make up the day when the fast was broken\n5.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Obligation of offering expiation (Kafarah)\xa0\nIn this case the expiation is severe: it is to free a slave; if that is not possible, then one must fast for two consecutive months; if he is not able to do that, then he must feed sixty poor persons.\xa0\nIt makes no difference whether ejaculation occurred or not, so long as intercourse took place.\xa0\nThat is different from the case if ejaculation occurred without intercourse ; in that case no expiation is required, but one still incurs sin, must refrain from eating and drinking for the rest of the day, and must make up that fast.\xa0\nWith regard to what it says in the question, “he ejaculated before doing the intercourse ”, if his penis entered his wife’s vagina, even if that was after ejaculation had occurred outside, then the severe expiation must also be offered in this case, because intercourse took place.\xa0\nIt says in Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah (35/55):\xa0\n“There is no difference of opinion among the jurists concerning the fact that expiation must be offered by anyone who has intercourse in the vagina during the day in Ramadan, deliberately and with no excuse, whether he ejaculates or not.”\xa0\nIn that case, the husband must offer expiation for every day on which he had intercourse. If intercourse occurred on the second occasion, then he must offer expiation twice.\xa0\nIf it was merely foreplay or thinking about intercourse , then when he ejaculated he felt lethargic and could not penetrate the vagina, then undoubtedly he was sinning by doing that, and he transgressed the limits set by Allah; he must repent, as must his wife if she took part willingly, but they only have to make up the day on which they broke the fast.\xa0\nIs ignorance of the punishment an excuse?\xa0\nIf a person is aware that intercourse during the day in Ramadan is prohibited, but he does not know that expiation is required for it, he must still offer expiation, because ignorance of the punishment is no excuse.\xa0\nExpiation for Breaking the Fast due to Intercourse\nThe expiation for intercourse during the day in Ramadan is one of three things, in this particular order. It is not the matter of choice, i.e., it is not permissible to move from one to another unless one is unable to do what is stipulated. They are: freeing a slave; if one cannot do that, then one must fast for two consecutive months; if he cannot do that, then he must feed sixty poor persons. It is not permissible for him to fast for two months if he can free a slave, and it is not permissible for him to feed sixty poor persons unless he is unable to do the first two actions, freeing a slave or fasting.\xa0\nThe scholars of the Committee said:\xa0\n“Expiation for intercourse during the day in Ramadan is done by doing one of the things mentioned above, in order of preference. One cannot move to fasting, for example, unless one is unable to free a slave; and one cannot move to feeding the poor unless one is unable to fast. If a person moves to feeding the poor because he is unable to free a slave or fast, it is permissible for him to offer iftar to sixty poor or needy persons who are fasting, giving them enough to eat their fill of the local staple food, once on his own account and once on behalf of his wife. Or he may give to 60 poor persons sixty Sa`s on his own behalf and on behalf of his wife, giving each one a Sa`, which is equivalent to approximately 3 kg.” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah (9/245)\xa0\nCan you delegate a charitable organisation to feed the poor on your behalf?\nIf the one who is obliged to offer this expiation has to feed the poor (because he is unable to do either of the first two actions listed), then there is nothing wrong with him delegating a trustworthy charitable organisation to feed the poor on his behalf, or distribute this food on his behalf to the poor.\xa0\nYou can also delegate your husband to offer the expiation on your behalf.\xa0\nCan you send the expiation to your homeland?\xa0\nThere is nothing wrong with sending the expiation to your original homeland, if the need there is greater because of the large numbers of poor people, as this may serve a greater purpose.\xa0\nIbn Muflih (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“It is permissible to transfer vows, expiation and bequests, according to the more correct scholarly opinion.” (Al-Furu` (4/265)\nThere is also no reason why your husband should not give this expiation on your behalf, if you consent to that.\xa0\nMust the wife offer expiation for breaking the fast due to intercourse?\nIf a man has intercourse with his wife during the day in Ramadan, one of two scenarios must be the case:\xa0\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 That at the time of intercourse the woman was excused because she was forced, or she forgot, or she was unaware of the prohibition on having intercourse during the day in Ramadan. In that case her fast is valid, and she does not have to make it up or offer expiation.\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 That she had no excuse; rather she willingly obeyed her husband in having intercourse. There is a difference of opinion among the scholars as to whether she is obliged to offer expiation in this case. The more correct view is that she is obliged to offer expiation in this case just as her husband is.\nDoes menses interrupt the sequence of the sixty-day expiation?\xa0\nIf the woman is obliged to fast for two consecutive months, and she starts to fast but then her menses comes , then that does not interrupt the sequence of her fasting . She should stop fasting (for the duration of her period), then make up the day’ missed while she was menstruating, and then complete the two months.\xa0\nThe same applies if she starts to fast then `Eid comes. She should stop fasting on the day of `Eid, then resume fasting immediately afterwards. Breaking the fast on the day of `Eid does not interrupt the sequence of fasts in the case of a fast offered as expiation.\xa0\nIs expiation waived if menses comes a few hours after breaking the fast by intercourse?\nIf a woman breaks her fast by having intercourse or otherwise, then she gets her menses a few hours after breaking the fast, the excuse of menses does not mean that the obligation to make up that day or offer expiation is waived, because she incurred the sin before the excuse came into effect; in other words, she did the forbidden action with no excuse, so the excuse does not have any impact on the ruling, just as it does not waive the burden of sin.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/189853/expiation-for-having-intercourse-during-daytime-in-ramadan
