295129,"Is it permissible to do Hajj on behalf of a Muslim person who has lost his memory, with no hope of recovery?","['Praise be to Allah.It is permissible to do Hajj on behalf of a Muslim who has lost his memory and on behalf of one who is insane, but this Hajj will not count as the obligatory Hajj for that person.\nAs for the obligatory Hajj, it cannot be done on their behalf during their lifetime, because of the possibility that the one who has lost his memory may regain it, and the one who is insane may regain his sanity, unless two trustworthy doctors confirm that there is no hope of his memory returning, in which case the obligatory Hajj may be done on his behalf.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: We have stated that if a person is sick, but there is hope that he may recover, it is not permissible to appoint someone to do Hajj on his behalf, and if he appoints someone to do it on his behalf during his lifetime then he dies, that does not count, according to the more correct of the two scholarly views.\nThen he said: It may be found out whether the patient has no hope of recovery based on the view of two Muslims of good character and expertise.\nRegarding the case of an insane person for whom there is still hope of recovery:\nThe author of ash-Shamil and our companions said: If Hajj became obligatory for him, then he became insane, no one should be appointed to do it on his behalf.\nBut if he dies, someone can do Hajj on his behalf.\nIf he appoints someone to do Hajj on his behalf when he is still alive, then he recovers, he must still do Hajj, according to scholarly consensus, as noted above regarding the sick person if he recovers…\nWe have noted above that our view, regarding a sick person for whom there is still hope of recovery, is that it is not valid for him to appoint someone to do Hajj on his behalf. The same applies to one who is insane: it is not valid for him to appoint someone to do the obligatory Hajj on his behalf. This is the view of Ahmad and Dawud.\nOur companions narrated from Abu Hanifah the view that it is permissible in both cases. He said: That depends: if he recovers, then he must do Hajj himself, but if he dies, then what was done [by someone else on his behalf] is valid.""(Al-Majmu‘\xa0 7/116).\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThere remains the issue of doing Hajj on behalf of one who is paralyzed – meaning one who is unable to move due to a chronic condition – is it valid to do Hajj on his behalf without his permission?\nOur companions said: It is not valid to do it on his behalf without his permission.\nWhat may be understood… – The commentator on the book said: There is a blank space in the two manuscripts of the book. Perhaps what is missing is: What may be understood is that that is permissible, because the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) likened it [Hajj] to a debt, and once a debt is paid off, the debtor is free of it, even if it is paid off without his permission. And Allah knows best. –\nMoreover:\nThis applies so long as it is possible to seek his permission. When it is not possible to seek his permission, it is possible that Allah could cause the action of someone else to take the place of his own action with regard to obligatory duties and complying with religious commandments, just as the actions of someone else may take the place of his actions in other recommended deeds, and reward will still be attained, as noted above regarding the giving of reward to the dead. We have already established this principle.""(Sharh al-‘Umdah – Kitab al-Hajj\xa0 2/192-193).\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If the parent is insane or has lost his or her memory without being insane, there is nothing wrong with doing Hajj on his or her behalf, so the may do it as an act of kindness, whether the parent is his father or his mother, because Hajj is not valid if an insane person does it for himself; the Hajj of one who is insane or mentally disabled is not valid if he does it for himself. But if someone else does it on his behalf, there is nothing wrong with that, and he does not have to do the obligatory Hajj. If he reaches the age of puberty and is still insane, Hajj is not required of him, but if his son or his brother or someone else does Hajj on his behalf, there is nothing wrong with that and he will have the reward thereof.""(Fatawa Nur ‘ala ad-Darb\xa0 17/73).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/295129/ruling-on-doing-the-obligatory-hajj-on-behalf-of-someone-who-has-lost-his-memory
298748,"It is said that death is connected to provision (rizq), so when the provision that is allocated to the son of Adam runs out, he will die. But what I am thinking is that provision is of different types, and there are many sources of provision. For example, in the case of money, there may be someone who is owed money by other people, but he dies. And there may be someone who does work for someone else, but before receiving payment for his work, he dies. And there may be someone who enjoys perfect health and well-being, but he dies. Isn’t the debt that is owed provision, and isn’t the payment for work provision, and isn’t good health provision, and so on and so forth? But I feel that there is a specific type of provision which, when it comes to an end, the individual will die after that. This is the case if debt is connected to provision, so what is that provision which, when it runs out, the individual will die after that?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly: the individual’s lifespan is how long he will remain in this world, and it is a type of provision (rizq) which, when it comes to an end, the individual will die. That is his lifespan.\nHumans are like all other creatures that have lifespans and an appointed time of death, which cannot be brought forward or put back, because the appointed time of death is the end of his allotted period. His lifespan is how long he remains in this worldly life, and his appointed time of death is when that period comes to an end.\nIt is soundly narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that he said: “Allah decided the decrees of creation fifty thousand years before He created the heavens and the earth. And His Throne was above the water.” Narrated by Muslim (2653).\nAnd it was soundly narrated that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There was Allah, and there was nothing before Him, and His Throne was above the water. He wrote everything in the Book and created the heavens and the earth. – According to one version: then He created the heavens and the earth. – And Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{So when their time has come, they will not remain behind an hour, nor will they precede [it]}\xa0[al-A‘raf 7:34].”\nNarrated by al-Bukhari (3191).\nAllah knows what will happen before it happens, for He has decreed that. So He knows that this one will die of a stomach disease, or pleurisy, or being crushed under a collapsed building, or drowning, or other causes of death, and that that one will be murdered either by poison, the sword, stones or other ways of killing.\nSee: Jami‘ al-Masa’il Vol. 7 (37).\nThe individual’s lifespan is included in the general meaning of provision (rizq), and whatever Allah has decreed of provision for a person will end when his lifespan ends. In the hadith that was narrated from ‘Abdullah it says: Umm Habibah, the wife of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: O Allah, let me have the joy of the company of my husband the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and my father Abu Sufyan, and my brother Mu ‘awiyah (all my life). The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “You have asked Allah about lifespans that have already been determined, days that have already been counted and provisions that have already been allotted. Allah will never do anything before its due time or delay it beyond its due time. If you had asked Allah to grant you refuge from punishment in the Fire or punishment in the grave, that would have been better or preferable.” Narrated by Muslim (2663).\nSecondly:\nWhat is discussed above has a valid meaning and makes sense, and what is mentioned in the question does not contradict it.\nProvision (rizq) includes what a person gets in this world that meets his essential and basic needs.\nProvision refers to everything that serves to meet a person’s needs in this life such as food, livestock, animals, fruit-bearing trees, clothing, and whatever he may acquire thereof by means of silver and gold (currency). Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And when [other] relatives and orphans and the needy are present at the [time of] division, then provide for them [something] out of the estate}\xa0[an-Nisa’ 4:8]\nthat is, from that which the deceased left behind.\nAnd He says:\n{Allah extends provision for whom He wills and restricts [it]. And they rejoice in the worldly life…}\xa0[ar-Ra‘d 13:26].\nAnd He says, telling the story of Qarun:\n{And We gave him of treasures\xa0…\n… Oh, how Allah extends provision to whom He wills of His servants and restricts it!}\n[al-Qasas 28:76-82] – what is meant here is the treasures of Qarun.\nAnd Allah says:\n{ And if Allah had extended [excessively] provision for His servants, they would have committed tyranny throughout the earth}\xa0[ash-Shura 42:27].\nIn Islamic terminology, according to the scholars of ahl as-sunnah, the meaning of rizq (provision) is the same as the linguistic meaning. The basic principle is that no specific religious meaning can be attributed to a word without evidence. So the word rizq (provision) applies to that which is acquired in both halal and haram ways, because whether it is acquired through halal or haram means is not relevant here. That is a matter to be discussed elsewhere, but we may note that Allah only accepts what is good and lawful. This varies from one stage of revelation to another, as in the case of alcohol and dealing in it before it was prohibited. The point is that they spent from whatever provision they had in their hands.\nAt-Tahrir wa’t-Tanwir (1/135-234). See also: al-Mu‘jam al-Ishtiqaqi (2/794-795).\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe word provision applies to that which Allah, may He be exalted, has permitted to a person and given him possession of it, and it may refer to that which nourishes a person. End quote from Majmu‘ al-Fatawa (8/545).\nBased on that, if a person dies before he has taken possession of something or before he has made use of it or benefitted from it, it is not part of the provision that was decreed for him. This is clear and understandable. That applies even if he did some work, then died before receiving payment for it; that payment was not part of the provision that was allocated to him in this world. And if he dies before he enjoys good health, then that good health was not part of the provision that was allocated to him in this world. The same applies to food that did not enter his stomach, or things that did not come into his possession or come under his control when he was in this world; these things were not allocated as provision for him.\nIn the hadith of ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud (may Allah be pleased with him), it says that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no deed that will bring a person closer to Paradise but I have enjoined it upon you, and there is no deed that will bring a person closer to Hell but I have forbidden it to you. No one should think that his provision is slow in coming, for Jibril (peace be upon him) inspired to me that none of you will ever depart this world until he has received his provision in full. So fear Allah, O people, and be moderate in seeking provision, and if one of you thinks that his provision is slow in coming, let him not seek it by disobeying Allah, for the bounty of Allah cannot be attained by disobeying Him.”\nNarrated by al-Hakim in al-Mustadrak (2189) and others. Al- Albani said: It is sahih because of corroborating evidence.\nConclusion:\nThe words mentioned in the question are sound, and there is nothing wrong with them.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/298748/the-connection-between-provision-rizq-and-death
411153,"I inherited a piece of land, and I am keeping it in case I need it to marry off a son of mine, or to pay for medical treatment and the like. Am I obliged to sell it in order to do the obligatory Hajj?","['Praise be to Allah.Hajj is obligatory for one who is able to do it, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And [due] to Allah from the people is a pilgrimage to the House - for whoever is able to find thereto a way}\xa0[Al ‘Imran 3:97].\nWhat is meant by being able to find thereto a way is being able to do it, both physically and financially. What is meant by being able financially to do it is having enough wealth to cover the expenses of Hajj, namely the journey there and back, and these funds should be surplus to his basic needs and the needs of his dependents for food, drink, clothing and transportation.\nIf this land is not cultivated to grow food and is not rented out so you can live on its rent, and you do not have any debts for which you need to sell off the land to pay them off, then it is surplus to your needs and you must sell it in order to do Hajj.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: What matters is that [this wealth] should be surplus to what he needs to spend on his dependents on whose maintenance he is obliged to spend, from when he leaves until he comes back, because spending [on their maintenance] has to do with people’s rights, and they are more in in need of the money and their rights are more important. ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that he said: “It is sufficient sin for a man to neglect those for whose maintenance he is responsible.” Narrated by Abu Dawud.\nIt should also be surplus to what he and his family need of shelter, a servant and other essentials, and should be surplus to what he needs to pay off his debt, because paying off debt is an essential need, and the rights of other people are connected to it. Therefore it is more important, hence the Lawgiver disallowed giving zakah [when there is a debt to be paid off], even though it has to do with the rights of the poor and they need it. So it is more appropriate to defer Hajj, which is due only to Allah, may He be exalted. It is the same whether the debt is owed to a specific person or is something that is owed to Allah, may He be exalted, such as zakah that is owed, or expiation that is to be offered, and the like.""(Al-Mughni\xa0 3/88).\nThe Permanent Committee (11/30) said: Being able to find a way to do Hajj means being physically healthy and owning the means of transportation to reach the Sacred House of Allah by plane, car or mount, or being able to pay for that according to one’s means, as well as having sufficient provision for the journey there and back. These funds should be surplus to what he needs to spend on those on whom he is obliged to spend until he returns from Hajj. A woman should also have her husband or mahram with her, even to travel for Hajj or ‘umrah. End quote.\nThe fact that you are keeping this land in order to marry off your son, or for other possible emergencies, such as needing medical treatment and the like, is not an excuse for not doing Hajj, so long as you could afford to do it with the proceeds of the land if you sell it. So put your trust in Allah, and do what Allah has enjoined you to do. Think positively of Him and seek compensation from Him.\nIt was narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Follow one Hajj or ‘umrah with another, for they eliminate poverty and sins as the bellows eliminate the dross of iron, gold and silver.” Narrated by at-Tirmidhi (810). He said: It is a sahih hasan hadith.\nIt was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no day on which people wake up, but two angels come down and one of them says: ‘O Allah, give more to the one who spends,’ and the other says, ‘O Allah, send destruction upon the one who withholds.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (1442) and Muslim (1010).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/411153/he-has-a-piece-of-land-which-he-is-keeping-in-case-he-needs-it-does-he-have-to-sell-it-in-order-to-do-hajj
