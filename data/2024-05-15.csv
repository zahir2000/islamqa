403949,Does this Hadith apply only to those who visit the sick Muslims to their home?,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nAbu Dawud (3099) and Imam Ahmad in ""Al-Musnad"" (2/47-48), among others, narrated from `Ali, who said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) say: ""When a man visits his Muslim brother, he walks in the harvest of Paradise until he sits down, and when he sits down, mercy envelops him. If it is in the morning, seventy thousand angels will pray for him until the evening, and if it is in the evening, seventy thousand angels will pray for him until the morning.""\nAbu Dawud said after Hadith number (3100): ""This was claimed to be narrated from `Ali, from the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) through unverified chains."" End quote.\nThis Hadith has been narrated with differences among its narrators; some have transmitted it as a statement of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him), and others as a statement of `Ali (may Allah be pleased with him).\nAt-Tirmidhi said after Hadith (969): ""This Hadith has also been narrated from `Ali through other chains, some of which are mawquf (stopped at the Companion) and not raised (to the Prophet)."" End quote.\nThe researchers of Al-Musnad said: ""Authentic as mawquf, its narrators are trustworthy, narrators of both Al-Bukhari and Muslim, but there is a difference of opinion on whether it is mawquf or marfu` (attributed to the Prophet), and the mawquf is more authentic."" End quote.\nAnd if the mawquf is considered more authentic, then it has the ruling of being marfu` (attributed to the Prophet), because such statements are not made based on opinion; they are from the knowledge of the unseen.\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n""An example of a statement that is considered marfu` in ruling, though not explicitly, is when a Companion, who does not take from the Isra\'iliyyat (Judeo-Christian traditions), speaks about matters that do not allow for ijtihad (independent reasoning), and are not related to explaining language or clarifying something obscure, such as narrating past events: from the beginning of creation, stories of the prophets, or future events: like battles, tribulations, and the conditions of the Day of Judgment, as well as narrating about specific rewards or punishments for certain actions. It is considered as marfu` because his narration of such matters implies that he has an informant, and matters that do not allow for ijtihad require someone to have established the statement, and there is no one to establish such statements for the Companions except the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him), or some who narrate from ancient scriptures. Therefore, this precaution is taken to avoid the second category.\nIf that is the case, then it has the ruling of what would be if he said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said, so it is marfu`, whether he heard it directly from him or through an intermediary."" End quote. ""Nuzhat An-Nazar"" (pp. 132-134).\nSecondly:\nThis Hadith encompasses everyone who intends to visit and care for the sick, seeking reward, whether the visitor is a stranger, a relative, a doctor, or a nurse; because actions are judged by intentions, and everyone will have what they intended; as narrated by `Umar ibn Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) say: ""Actions are (judged) by intentions, and everyone will have what they intended. Therefore, whoever\'s migration is for worldly gain or to marry a woman, then his migration will be for what he migrated for."" Narrated by Al-Bukhari (1) and Muslim (1907).\nA single action can sometimes be performed with the intention of two acts of worship or one act of worship and a customary act, and this is a mercy from Allah to this nation.\nShaykh `Abd Ar-Rahman As-Sa`di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n""From the grace and facilitation of Allah is that a single action can stand in place of multiple actions. So, if one enters the mosque at the time of the prescribed prayer and prays two rak`ahs, intending by them both the prescribed prayer and the greeting of the mosque, he will attain the reward for both."" End quote. ""Al-Qawa`id wal-Usul Al-Jami`ah"" (p. 168).\nAn example of this is what was reported in the Hadith of Zaynab, the wife of `Abdullah ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with them both), when she asked the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) while desiring to give charity from her wealth: ""Would it suffice for me to spend on my husband and the orphans under my care?\nHe said: Yes, and she will have two rewards: the reward of kinship and the reward of charity."" Narrated by Al-Bukhari (1466) and Muslim (1000).\nFrom this principle, a doctor or nurse can rightfully perform their required duties with the intention of visiting and helping the sick.\nShaykh `Umar Sulayman Al-Ashqar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n""Those who work in worldly professions among Muslims: doctors, engineers, and researchers, can make their work acts of worship by having a righteous intention when performing these tasks, and this does not oblige them to not seek their worldly benefits from these works."" End quote. ""Maqasid Al-Mukallafin"" (p. 400).\nSuch an intention is among the righteous deeds, leading the doctor and nurse to show kindness to the patients, be patient with them, and not to be annoyed or mistreat them.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/403949/is-the-hadith-authentic
72828,"If I miss Duha prayer after twelve noon, should I make it up even if that it after Dhuhr prayer?.","['Praise be to Allah.The time for Duha prayer\n“The time for Duha prayer is from when the sun has risen to the height of a spear, which is fifteen or twenty minutes after sunrise, until just before the sun passes its zenith (and the zenith is when the time for Dhuhr prayer begins).\xa0\nWhat is meant by just before the sun passes its zenith is ten to fifteen minutes before it reaches the zenith, i.e. before the time when it is forbidden to pray begins.” (Majmu` Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin, 14/306)\xa0\nIbn Muflih (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The time for (Duha) is from when the time when it is forbidden to prays ends, until the sun reaches its zenith. What is meant – and Allah knows best – is just before the sun passes its zenith, because it is forbidden to pray at that time.” (Al-Furu`, 1/5670)\xa0\nShould one make up Duha prayer?\nThe scholars differed with regard to making up Duha prayer if the time had ended. Some of them were of the view that it should be made up, and this is the correct view according to the Shafi`is and some of the Hanbalis. Others were of the view that it should not be made up. This is the old view of Ash-Shafi`i and of the Hanbalis and Malikis.\xa0\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Majmu` (3/532): “Our companions said: Optional prayers are of two types,\xa0\n\none that is not connected to a specific time and is only done for a reason such as eclipses, praying for rain and greeting the mosque. If it is missed, it cannot be made up.\nThe second type is connected to a specific time, such as Eid prayer, Duha and regular Sunnah prayers that are offered with obligatory prayers, such as the Sunnah of Dhuhr etc.\n\nThere are three views concerning these:\n\nThe correct view is that it is recommended to make them up. Al-Qadi Abu’l-Tayyib and others said that this is the view that is stated in the new view (of Ash-Shafa`i).\xa0\nThe second view is that they should not be made up. This was stated in the old view (of Ash-Shafa`i), and it is the view of Abu Hanifah.\xa0\nThe third view is that independent prayers such as Eid and Duha should be made up, whereas prayers that are not independent such as the regular Sunnah prayers that are offered with obligatory prayers should not be made up. If they are made up then the correct view is that they should always be made up. Some of our companions narrated an inauthentic view which is that missed prayers of the day may be made up so long as the sun has not set and missed prayers of the night may be made up so long as the sun has not risen. Based on this, the Sunnah of Fajr may be made up so long as it is still day… This is all inauthentic and the correct view is that it is recommended to make up all prayers at all times. The evidence for that is the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him):\xa0 “Whoever sleeps and misses a prayer or forgets it, let him pray it when he remembers it.” And Abu Qatadah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) missed Fajr prayer whilst travelling, until the sun had risen. So he did Wudu’ then he prayed two Rak`ahs, then the iqamah was given and he prayed Fajr prayer. What is meant by two Rak`ahs here is the regular Sunnah prayer that comes before Fajr. And Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prayed two Rak`ahs after ‘Asr and she asked him about that. He said: “Some people from ‘Abd Al-Qays came to me with the news that their people had become Muslim and they distracted me from the two Rak`ahs that come after Dhuhr, so I did these two Rak`ahs after ‘Asr.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim). And Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever did not pray two Rak`ahs of Fajr until the sun rose, let him pray them (now).” Narrated by Al-Bayhaqi with a jayyid isnad. And it was narrated from Abu Sa`id (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever slept and missed Witr, or forgot it, let him pray it when he remembers.” Narrated by Abu Dawud with a sound chain of narrators. And it was narrated from `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that if the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) missed praying at night because of pain or anything else, he would pray twelve Rak`ahs during the day. Narrated by Muslim. There are many other Hadiths about this matter, apart from those which we have mentioned, but this is sufficient. And Allah is the Source of strength.”\n\nAl-Mardawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Insaf (2/191): “Shaykh `Abd Al-Qadir said: He may do it after the sun has passed its zenith, but if he delays it until he has prayed Dhuhr, he may make it up.”\nThe Hanafis stated that if the Sunnah prayers are missed, none of them should be made up except the Sunnah of Fajr, which should be made up if it is missed along with the obligatory prayer, and it may be made up until the sun reaches its zenith. (Al-Fatawa Al-Hindiyyah, 1/112)\xa0\nThis is also the view of the Malikis. In their view no optional prayer should be made up except the two Rak`ahs of Fajr, which may be made up until the sun reaches the zenith, whether the obligatory Fajr prayer was offered alongside it or not. (Bulghat As-Salik, 1/408)\xa0(See also Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah Al-Kuwaitiyyah, 34/37)\xa0\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) favoured the view that Duha prayer should not be made up if the time for it has ended. He was asked: If the Sunnah prayer of Duha is missed, should it be made up or not? \xa0\nHe replied:\xa0\n“If the time for Duha prayer is missed, then the prayer has been missed, because it is limited to that time. But with regard to the regular Sunnah prayers , because they are connected to the obligatory prayers, they may be made up alongside them. The same also applies to Witr, because it is proven in the Sunnah that if the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) slept or was ill at night he would pray twelve rak`ahs during the day. And Witr may also be made up .”\xa0 (Majmu` Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin, 14/305)\xa0\nThe matter is broad in scope, praise be to Allah.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/72828/should-one-make-up-duha-prayer
382372,What is the meaning of this part of a lengthy hadith,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe Sunnah indicates that people will see their Lord on the Day of Resurrection during the reckoning, and the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) will see Him when he intercedes for creation at the time of judgment. This is the first vision.\nThen, when the disbelievers are taken to the Fire, and this Ummah remains, including its hypocrites, Allah will come to them in a form different from the one they saw Him in the first time, and this is a test and trial for them. He will ask them what they are waiting for, and they will say they are waiting for their Lord. He will ask if there is a sign between them and Him, and they will say: the Shin. Then He will reveal His Shin, and the believers will prostrate. When they raise their heads, they will see Him in His first form.\nAs for the first vision: it is evidenced by the Hadith of `Adi ibn Hatim reported by Al-Bukhari (1413) which includes the Prophet\'s statement (peace and blessings be upon him): ""Then each one of you will stand before Allah without a veil or an interpreter to translate for him,"" and the Hadith of Abu Hurairah reported by Muslim (2968): ""Then the servant will meet [Allah], and He will say: \'O so-and-so, did I not honor you, and make you a leader, and marry you, and subjugate horses and camels for you, and allow you to be in charge and to have comfort?\' He will say: \'Yes.\' [Allah] will say: \'Did you think that you would meet Me?\' He will say: \'No.\' [Allah] will say: \'Then I will forget you as you forgot Me.\'"" The meeting includes seeing, then the veiling occurs for the disbelievers. See: Majmu` Al-Fatawa by Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (6/462-468).\nAnd in the Hadith of Anas regarding intercession reported by Al-Bukhari (7440) and Muslim (193): ""Then I will ask permission to approach my Lord, and permission will be granted to me. When I see Him, I will fall prostrate..."" This confirms the Prophet\'s (peace and blessings be upon him) vision of his Lord on the Day of Resurrection before Allah comes to the believers in a different form, and it reinforces the affirmation of the first vision.\nIt has been reported by Ahmad (15), Ibn Khuzaymah in At-Tawhid (2/735), and Ibn Hibban (6476) from the Hadith of Hudhayfah about Abu Bakr: ""...go to Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him), so he may intercede for you with your Lord, the Mighty and Majestic. He said: \'Then he will go, and Jibril (peace be upon him) will come to his Lord, and Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, will say: \'Grant him permission, and give him the glad tidings of Paradise.\' He said: \'Then Jibril will take him, and he will fall prostrate for the duration of a Friday, and Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, will say: \'Raise your head, O Muhammad, speak and you will be heard, and intercede and your intercession will be accepted.\' He said: \'Then he will raise his head, and when he looks at his Lord, the Mighty and Majestic, he will fall prostrate for the duration of another Friday, and Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, will say: \'Raise your head, speak and you will be heard, and intercede and your intercession will be accepted.\'"" And its chain of narration is sound as stated by Sheikh Shu`aib Al-Arnaut in his verification of Ibn Hibban.\nAnd Ibn Hibban (6480) reported from the Hadith of Anas: ""Then his Lord will manifest to him, and no prophet before him will have seen Him. He will fall prostrate to Allah, and praise Him with praises that no one before him has praised Him with, and no one after him will praise Him with."" And its chain of narration is sound.\nAs for the second and third visions: in the Hadith of Abu Sa`id reported by Muslim (183): ""...the Lord of the Worlds, Glorified and Exalted, will come to them in a form not recognisable to them. He will say: \'What are you waiting for? Every nation will follow what they used to worship.\' They will say: \'Our Lord, we parted with people in the world when we were most in need of them, and we did not accompany them.\' He will say: \'I am your Lord.\' They will say: \'We seek refuge with Allah from you; we do not associate anything with Allah.\' This will happen two or three times, until some of them are almost turned away. He will say: \'Is there a sign between you and Him by which you will recognize Him?\' They will say: \'Yes.\' Then the Shin will be revealed, and no one who used to prostrate to Allah of his own accord will remain except that Allah will permit him to prostrate, and no one who used to prostrate out of fear and showing off will remain except that Allah will make his back a single plate, every time he tries to prostrate, he will fall on his back. Then they will raise their heads, and He will have changed into the form they saw Him in the first time. He will say: \'I am your Lord.\' They will say: \'You are our Lord.\' Then the bridge will be set over Hell.""\nAnd in the Hadith of Abu Sa`id reported by Al-Bukhari: ""He said: \'Then the Compeller will come to them in a form other than the one they saw Him in the first time. He will say: \'I am your Lord.\' They will say: \'You are our Lord.\' And no one will speak to Him except the prophets. He will say: \'Is there a sign between you and Him that you recognize?\' They will say: \'The Shin.\' Then He will reveal His Shin, and every believer will prostrate to Him, and those who used to prostrate to Allah out of showing off and seeking reputation will remain, and when they go to prostrate, their backs will become one plate."" Meaning their backbones will become even, and they will not be able to bow for prostration.\nThe form in which Allah comes to His servants is unknown to us; it is part of the unseen that He has not informed us about. We believe in it and submit, and we do not indulge in our whims, nor do we imagine, nor do we liken, nor do we represent, for He, Glorified be He, ""cannot be grasped by the minds through contemplation, nor can the hearts imagine Him through picturing, {There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing} [Ash-Shura: 11]."" End quote from Lum`at Al-I`tiqad by Ibn Qudamah, p. 5.\nSecondly:\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) affirmed that this light is the light of the veil, saying: ""The light with which He veiled Himself is called light and fire, as there is hesitation in its expression in the authentic Hadith, the Hadith of Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari, which is his statement: \'His veil is light or fire.\' Indeed, this fire is light, and it is the one in which Allah spoke to His messenger Moses, and it is a pure fire that has brightness without burning."" End quote from Mukhtasar As-Sawa`iq, p. 423.\nAnd the fact that the light in the tree is the light of Allah the Almighty does not contradict His highness above His Throne, but it indicates closeness to what is below the heavens.\nShaykh Al-Islam (may Allah have mercy on him) said: ""And if the caller is Allah, Lord of the Worlds, and He called him from a specific place and brought him close; this indicates what the Salaf said: of His closeness and nearness to Musa (peace be upon him); even though this closeness is from what is below the heavens."" End quote from Majmu` Al-Fatawa (5/464).\nAnd what is well-known about the descent among the Salaf is that they say: He descends without the Throne being empty of Him, and this indicates that His descent is not like the descent of the created beings, Glorified and Exalted be He, and Sanctified. He descends to the lowest heaven and there is nothing above Him, and no one knows how He descends except Him, Glorified be He.\nAnd Shaykh Al-Islam (may Allah have mercy on him) said: ""And the basis of this: that His closeness - Glorified be He - and His nearness to some of His creatures, does not necessitate that His essence is empty from above the Throne. Rather, He is above the Throne, and He draws near to His creation as He wills, as those who said it from the Salaf said, and this is like His closeness to Musa when He spoke to him from the tree."" End quote from Sharh Hadith An-Nuzul, p. 99.\nAnd it does not entail any problematic issue such as something encompassing Him, but He, the Exalted, is high in His nearness, above everything.\nFor this reason, Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said in this context: ""And His statement (translation of the meaning): {And Glorified be Allah, Lord of the Worlds} means:\xa0 He who does what He wills and does not resemble any of His creatures, and nothing of His creations encompasses Him, and He is the Most High, the Great, distinct from all creatures, and the earth and the heavens do not contain Him, but He is the One, the Eternal Refuge, sanctified from resembling the created things."" End quote from Tafsir Ibn Kathir (6/180).\nThirdly:\nMusa (peace be upon him) did not see his Lord, and Allah is exalted above taking the form of fire or a human, for Allah, Glorified be He, is unlike anything.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/382372/the-hadith-about-allah-coming-in-a-form-muslims-do-not-recognize
127141,"Is this Hadith authentic: “At the time of sunset, we say Bismillah and close the windows so that the jinn will not enter”?","['Praise be to Allah.It is narrated in an authentic report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded us to close the doors and mention the name of Allah at night, when night begins, when going to sleep. That is so that the Muslim may protect his house and his family from any harmful devil coming in, whether from among mankind or the jinn, and from harmful animals or insects coming in.\nIt was narrated from Jabir ibn `Abd-Allah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:\xa0\n“When the wings of the night spread – or when evening comes – keep your children in, for the devils come out at that time. Then when part of the night has passed, let them go. And close the doors and mention the name of Allah, for the devil does not open a closed door. And tie up your waterskins and mention the name of Allah, and cover your vessels and mention the name of Allah, even if you only put something over them, and extinguish your lamps.”\xa0(Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 3280 and Muslim, 2012). A version narrated by Muslim says:\xa0“Cover vessels, tie up waterskins, close doors and extinguish lamps, for the devil does not undo waterskins or open doors or uncover vessels.”\xa0\nImam An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) included this in a chapter entitled:\xa0\n“Chapter of the command to cover vessels, tie up waterskins, close doors and mention the name of Allah over them, extinguish lamps and fires when going to sleep, and keep children and livestock in after sunset.”\xa0\nMuslim (2013) narrated in the same chapter that Jabir ibn `Abd-Allah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not let your animals and children go out when the sun has set, until the first part of the night is over, for the devils come out when the sun sets, until the first part of the night is over.”\xa0\nIbn Hibban narrated it in his Sahih (4/90) as follows:\xa0\n“Tie up your water skins and close your doors when you go to bed at night, and cover food and drink, for the devil comes, and if he does not find the door closed he will enter, and if he does not find the waterskin tied up he will drink from it, and if he finds the door closed and the waterskin tied up, he does not open any water skin and he does not open a closed door, and if one of you cannot find something to cover his vessel in which is his drink, let him a place a stick over it.”\xa0\nImam Ibn `Abd Al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“In this Hadith there is a command to close doors of houses at night. This is a Sunnah which is enjoined to protect people against the devils of mankind and the jinn. As for the words “the devil does not open a closed door and he does not untie a water skin” this is telling us of the blessing of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, to his human slaves, for he (the devil)\xa0 has not been given the power to open the door, or undo a water skin or uncover a vessel; these things have been forbidden to him, even though he has been given the power to do some things that are more difficult than that, such as going through and penetrating in ways that man cannot.” (Al-Istidhkar, 8/363)\xa0\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Ibn Daqiq Al-`Eid said: in the command to close doors there are both religious and worldly benefits which protect lives and wealth from evildoers, and especially the devils.\xa0\nAs for the words “the devil does not open a closed door,” this is an indication that the command to close doors serves the purpose of keeping the devil away from mixing with people. The reason given is something that can be known through Revelation. The definite article is referring to the type, it does not mean any specific individual.” (Fath Al-Bari, 11/87)\xa0\nHe also said (may Allah have mercy on him):\xa0\n“Al-Qurtubi said: All commands on this issue are aimed at serving an interest for man, and are to be understood as recommendations, especially with regard to the one who does that with the intention of following the command.\xa0\nIbn Al-`Arabi said: Some people think that the command to close doors is general and is applicable to all times, but that is not the case. Rather it is limited to the night. It is as if the night is singled out in this case because the day is usually the time when people are awake, unlike the night. The whole idea is connected to the devil, because he is the one who makes the mouse burn the house.” (Fath Al-Bari, 6/356 -357)\xa0\nAl-Khatib Al-Shirbini Ash-Shafi`i (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“When night comes, it is Sunnah to cover vessels even if only with a stick, to tie up water skins, and to close doors, mentioning the name of Allah in all three cases, and to keep children and livestock in during the first part of the night, and to extinguish lamps when going to sleep.” (Mughni Al-Muhtaj, 1/31)\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“When going to sleep, one should close the door.” (Sharh Riyadh As-Salihin)\xa0\nFor more details, please refer to the following answers: 10513 , 42073 , 97221 and 146797 .\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/127141/is-it-sunnah-to-close-the-doors-at-night
