263615,"How can I know what work is prohibited and what is lawful? Because here in Germany there are many jobs that are unlawful or dubious. Many times I have read that if someone works in a place where alcohol or pork are sold, it is unlawful for him to work in that place.","['Praise be to Allah.Which jobs are permissible in Islam?\nThe guideline on permissible work is that it should be in a permissible field and should not involve helping others to commit unlawful acts.\nThis includes working in buying and selling, and rental, of permissible things such as selling food, medicine, tools and equipment, and the like. It also includes working in teaching, medicine, engineering, electricity, carpentry, and manufacturing, and innumerable other permissible types of work.\nWhich jobs are Prohibited in Islam?\nAs for unlawful work , that includes: working in Riba-based banks or commercial insurance companies, or carrying alcohol , or raising pigs , or writing down contracts of Riba, or equipping places for gambling, or selling things that it is thought most likely will be used for unlawful purposes, such as selling weapons to bandits, and other things that are regarded as prohibited and sinful, or helping in it directly or almost directly .\nAs for helping in it indirectly, whilst not intending to help in sin and transgression, that is not unlawful. That includes selling permissible food to a disbeliever, one who deals in Riba, or one who gambles. It cannot be said that by means of this food one is nourishing them and giving them the strength to commit sin. If indirectly helping them was forbidden, then people would never find permissible work except in very rare cases.\nHence the Companions used to deal with the Jews, buying and selling, renting, and so on, because they benefited from such activities.\nIf the work in and of itself is permissible, and does not involve directly helping anyone to commit unlawful acts, it is permissible.\nThis is the guideline that we can mention in this regard, with regard to whether work is lawful or prohibited.\nBased on that, if there is a bakery that sells permissible types of bread, and other types that are unlawful because they are contain alcohol, for example, and the worker’s role is limited to dealing with the permissible bread, and he is not helping with that which is unlawful in any way, then in the case of extreme need it is permissible for him to do this job, but he should look for other work, because seeing the evil deed makes it obligatory for him to object to it, and he may not be able to do that. So he should leave the place in that case, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And it has already come down to you in the Book that when you hear the verses of Allah [recited], they are denied [by them] and ridiculed; so do not sit with them until they enter into another conversation. Indeed, you would then be like them. Indeed Allah will gather the hypocrites and disbelievers in Hell all together.”\xa0[An-Nisa’ 4:140]\nAl-Jassas (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Ahkam Al-Quran (2/407):\xa0\n“This verse indicates that it is obligatory to express the objection to an evil deed to the one who is doing it, and that part of objecting to it is expressing displeasure, if it is not possible to remove it, and to refrain from sitting with the one who is doing it, and to get up and leave him, until he stops doing that and begins to do something else.”\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: What is the ruling on working for the owners of shops selling gold, in which they engage in transactions that are Islamically unacceptable, whether that is dealing with Riba, using prohibited tricks, deceiving customers, and other transactions that are not acceptable according to shari‘ah?\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) replied:\xa0\n“Working for these people who deal in Riba, use deceit, and other prohibited things is prohibited, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“but do not cooperate in sin and aggression.”\xa0[Al-Ma’idah 5:2]\n“And it has already come down to you in the Book that when you hear the verses of Allah [recited], they are denied [by them] and ridiculed; so do not sit with them until they enter into another conversation. Indeed, you would then be like them. Indeed Allah will gather the hypocrites and disbelievers in Hell all together.”\xa0[An-Nisa’ 4:140]\nAnd because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: ““Whoever among you sees an evil action, then let him change it with his hand [by taking action]; if he cannot, then with his tongue [by speaking out]; and if he cannot, then with his heart [by hating it].” But the one who works with them is not changing anything, whether with his hand, his tongue or his heart, so he is disobeying the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).” (Fiqh wa Fatawa Al-Buyu‘, p. 392)\nSo this friend of yours should look for another job in which he will be able to avoid seeing evil.\nBut so long as he does not go near the pork or help with it in any way, then his salary is lawful, because it is in return for his work with the permissible bread, but he is sinning by not objecting the evil, and this is what makes it necessary for him to look for another job.\nThus you will know that there is nothing wrong with you eating his food or accepting his gifts, for his salary is permissible.\nCan you work in commercial insurance companies?\nWorking in commercial insurance companies is prohibited, because commercial insurance is based on Riba (usury) and gambling .\nBut with regard to wealth that is unlawful because of the manner in which it is acquired, it is only prohibited for the one who acquires it; so there is no blame on the one who takes it from him in a lawful manner, such as gifts, maintenance and the like.\nBased on that, there is nothing wrong with you eating food or accepting anything of the wealth of the one who works in this unlawful insurance field.\nThirdly:\nHow to earn lawful money\nThe ways of earning a lawful income are many, but the matter may need some research and effort. Whoever fears Allah, may He be exalted, He will grant him provision and help him, as He, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And whoever fears Allah - He will make for him a way out.\nAnd will provide for him from where he does not expect. And whoever relies upon Allah - then He is sufficient for him. Indeed, Allah will accomplish His purpose. Allah has already set for everything a [decreed] extent.”\xa0[At-Talaq 65:2-3]\nSo strive to look for permissible work, that is free of mixing and seeing evil things. Caution in this regard is something praiseworthy, for whoever strives to avoid dubious matters will protect his religious commitment from shortcomings and will protect his honour from slander, and whoever falls into doubtful matters will soon fall into prohibited matters.\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said:\n“Whoever guards against the doubtful matters will protect his religious commitment from shortcomings and will protect his honour from slander, but whoever falls into that which is doubtful will fall into that which is prohibited, like a shepherd who grazes his flock around prohibited land; he will soon graze in it.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 52, and Muslim, 1599)\nAnd he said: “Leave that which makes you doubt for that which does not make you doubt.” Narrated by At-Tirmidhi (2518) and An-Nasa’i (5711). At-Tirmidhi said: This is an authentic Hadith. It was classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Tirmidhi.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/263615/islamically-permissible-and-prohibited-jobs-in-the-west
98580,"I wore the socks under my shoes after performing Wudu. Then I made Wudu and wiped on the shoes. If I take my shoes off, am I permitted to continue the wiping for the allowed period of time, wiping on my socks?","['Praise be to Allah.If a person wears Khuff (leather socks) over socks , or Khuff over Khuff, to which of them does the ruling apply? That is subject to further discussion. \xa0\nShaykh Muhammad ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \xa0\n\nIf he puts on socks or Khuff then invalidates his Wudu , then he puts something else on before he does Wudu, then the ruling applies to the first one. This means if he wants to wipe over them after that, he must wipe over the first one, and it is not permissible for him to wipe over the upper layer.\nIf he puts on socks or Khuff , then loses his Wudu and wipes over them, then he puts something else on over them, then he may wipe over the second layer, according to the correct opinion.\n\nIt says in Al-Furu`: ‘It is permissible according to Malik.’ An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: ‘This appears to be more correct because he put them on when he was in a state of purity, and the suggestion of those who say that purity is not complete is not acceptable.’\xa0\nIf we accept that, then it is the beginning of the period during which he may wipe (over the Khuff or socks ), and in this case he may wipe over the first (layer) without a doubt.\xa0\n\nIf he puts a Khuff over a Khuff or socks , and wipes over the top layer then takes it off, can he wipe over the lower layer for the remainder of the period? I have not seen anyone who explicitly stated this, but An-Nawawi narrated from Abu Al-`Abbas ibn Surayj, concerning a case where an overshoe is worn over the Khuff: they are like a single Khuff, of which the upper layer is visible and the lower layer is hidden. I say: based on that, it is permissible to wipe over the lower layer until the period for wiping over the upper layer ends, such as if the upper layer of the Khuff is scratched off, he may wipe over the lower layer.” (Fatawa At-Taharah by Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin, p. 192)\xa0\n\n“The overshoe or galosh is a Khuff that is worn over the ordinary Khuff, especially in cold countries.\xa0What is meant by the upper and lower (or outer and inner) layers is if there is a Khuff of two layers, then the upper layer is called the outer and the lower layer is called the inner.” (Al-Sharh Al-Mumti`, 1/211)\xa0\nThus it is clear that if a person wears Khuff over socks, then he takes off the upper or outer layer of the two, if he wipes over it, then his taking it off does not invalidate his wiping, and he may wipe over the lower or inner layer, in all the cases mentioned by Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him), until the end of the period for wiping over the Khuff or socks .\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/98580/wearing-a-khuff-over-socks-which-to-wipe-over-in-wudu
474798,"I know a man, a relative of mine, who works for apps, delivering orders; he is the one who delivers orders to people, such as food and other things. But some companies stipulate conditions, one of which is that the car should not be of lower quality than a certain model, or it should be of certain types. This relative goes against these two conditions, and he has not changed until now. I advised him that this is going against the conditions, and that is not permissible, and I said: your wealth that you earn from this work may be haram. But he was not convinced, and he says: The car is very good, and there is nothing wrong with it, and I am not doing anything wrong. I want a fatwa about what he is doing, and which explains how to get rid of this wealth if it is haram. Is what he is doing not permissible? And is that money haram?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIf the company stipulated that in order to work for them, the representative should have a car of a certain make and model, and he accepted that, then he must meet that condition, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {O you who have believed, fulfill [all] contracts} [al-Ma’idah 5:1]. And the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The Muslims are bound by their conditions.” Narrated by Abu Dawud (3594); classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud.\nAl-Bayhaqi (14826) narrated that ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Rights are defined by stipulated conditions. Classed as sahih by al-Albani in al-Irwa’ (6/303).\nIn other words, the rights of each party to a contract are to be determined according to the conditions that they both stipulated. So the one who stipulates a condition for himself is bound by that condition, so he is obliged to fulfil what he stipulated.""(Mawsu‘ah al-Qawa‘id al-Fiqhiyyah by Dr. Muhammad Sidqi Al Burno\xa0 10/809).\nGoing against those conditions is lying and cheating, both of which are haram. So if he claims that he is complying with the conditions when in fact he is not doing so, then he is a liar, and if he had the stipulated kind of car, then he replaced it with another car without the knowledge of the company, then he is cheating.\nIt was narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “And beware of lying, for lying leads to wickedness and wickedness leads to Hell. A man may continue to tell lies and endeavour to tell lies, until he is recorded with Allah as a liar.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (5743) and Muslim (2607).\nMuslim (102) narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever deceives is not of me.”\nAnd he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Scheming and deceiving lead to the Fire.” Narrated by al-Bayhaqi in Shu‘ab al-Iman; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami‘.\nSecondly:\nThe money that he earns is permissible for him, because it is in return for his efforts at work, although he has incurred sin by lying and cheating, and he must repent from that, by stopping work until he acquires a car that meets the conditions, or he informs the company about the car that he is using at present.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/474798/going-against-the-delivery-companys-stipulations-with-regard-to-the-make-and-model-of-the-car
148062,I have an injury on my toe; can I put a bandage on it? What should I do in Wudu? Is it permissible for me to wipe over the socks in this case?,"['Praise be to Allah.How to make Wudu when injured\nWhat is required is to wash the parts of the body that Allah has enjoined washing in Wudu and to wash each part thoroughly so that there is no part of it that the water had not reached.\xa0\nIf there is an injury in the part that one is enjoined to wash, and there is the fear that it will be harmed or healing may be delayed by washing it, then he may wipe over it with water if it is uncovered and he is able to wipe over it. If it is uncovered but he is not able to wipe over it, then he should wash whatever he can of the parts of his body and do Tayammum instead for the parts that he cannot wash or wipe over.\xa0\nIf a bandage, plaster or medicine has been put on it that prevents water reaching it, he should wipe over the bandage or plaster.\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“If there is a wound on a part of the body that is washed when (ritually) purifying oneself, there are several scenarios:\xa0\n\nIt is not covered and will not be harmed by washing. In this case he has to wash it if it is in a spot that is to be washed.\nIt is not covered but will be harmed by washing but not by wiping. In this case he has to wipe it instead of washing it.\nIt is not covered but will be harmed by both washing and wiping. In this case he should do Tayammum for it.\nIt is covered with a band-aid or the like that is needed. In this case he should wipe over that covering and that will suffice in place of washing that part, and he does not have to do Tayammum.” (Majmu` Fatawa wa Rasa’il Ibn `Uthaymin, 11/121. See also Al-Mughni by Ibn Qudamah, 1/172-173; Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah, 14/273)\n\nBased on the above,\xa0if your toe will not be harmed by water, then it must be washed. If it will be harmed by washing but will not be harmed by wiping, then it must be wiped. If it will be harmed by washing and wiping, and has been covered with a dressing, it is sufficient for you to wipe over the dressing .\xa0\nWiping over socks\nWith regard to wiping over the socks, if you had previously washed your entire feet or washed whatever you were able to and wiped over the injured part , as described above, then put on the socks when you were in a state of purity, it is permissible for you to wipe over them for a period of one day and one night, if you are not travelling, and for three days and three nights if you are travelling.\xa0\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“If he put on the Khuff (leather socks) when in a state of purity in which he did Wudu and wiped over the dressing, then it is permissible to wipe over the ،huff.""
