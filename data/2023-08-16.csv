317409,"One day we found a gift, a brand-new mobile phone, in the window of the children’s room, and we do not know who put it there. With it there was a small piece of paper on which was written “This is a gift for you, Son-and-so son of So-and-so” – addressed to my fourteen-year-old son. Is it permissible to take it and use it? Or what should we do in this case?","['Praise be to Allah.One of the established principles in Islamic teachings is that the Muslim should not take something that belongs someone else unless it is given with the owner’s willing consent. So if it becomes clear that there was consent, on the basis of acceptable proof, then it is permissible to take that thing in that case.\nProof that is regarded as acceptable, according to the purists, includes reasonable circumstantial evidence.\nShaykh az-Zarqa (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhat is meant by circumstantial evidence is any clear sign that clarifies a subtle issue and confirms it.""(Al-Madkhal al-Fiqhi al-‘Am\xa0 2/936).\nCircumstantial evidence that is that which makes an issue go from being possible to being most likely to be the case, and what it indicates is to be taken into account as being reliable, unless it is contradicted by other evidence that is stronger than it.\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe Lawgiver did not disregard signs, indications and circumstantial evidence; rather whoever examines the religious texts will find proof that these things carry weight and rulings may be based on them.""(At-Turuq al-Hukmiyyah\xa0 1/27).\nThe scholars have a great deal of evidence to support that, including the report narrated by Abu Dawud (3632) from Jabir ibn ‘Abdillah, who said: I wanted to go out to Khaybar, so I came to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and greeted him with salaam, and I said to him: I want to go out to Khaybar. He said: “When you come to my deputy, take five wasqs from him. If he asks you for a sign, place your hand on his collar bone.”\nThe isnad of this hadith was classed as hasan by al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar, who said: al-Bukhari narrated part of it in a mu‘allaq report at the end of Kitab al-Khumus.""(At-Talkhis al-Habir\xa0 3/122).\nBased on that:\nThe fact that you found a mobile phone in the window of the house, accompanied by a message stating that its owner was giving it as a gift to So-and-so, is circumstantial evidence which indicates that it is a gift and is permissible for you, and that as a result it becomes the property of your son.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/317409/he-received-a-gift-from-an-unknown-person
20759,Is providing breast milk (mother/wet nurse) to an infant too young to live on solid foods a required duty?,"['Praise be to Allah.Breastfeeding is the right of the child\nIf the infant needs to be breastfed, then breast milk must be provided for him.\xa0\nIt says in al-Mawsu’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (22/239):\xa0\n“There is no difference of opinion among the jurists that it is obligatory to breastfeed an infant so long as he needs that and he is at the age for breastfeeding.\xa0\nBreastfeeding is a proven right of the infant, according to the rulings of the Shari’ah, and must be provided for him by the one whose duty it is to do so. The jurists clearly stated that breastfeeding is the right of the child.\xa0\nThey explained the reason for that as being that breastfeeding for an infant is like maintenance for an adult.\xa0\nWhat they said is true and is indicated by the Quran. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“but the father of the child shall bear the cost of the mother’s food and clothing on a reasonable basis.” [Al-Baqarah 2:233]\nAllah has enjoined upon the father to spend on the woman who nurses his child, because nutrition reaches the child via the nurse through breast milk. So spending on the nurse is in fact spending on him.\n\nIt says in Sharh Muntaha al-Iradat:\xa0\n“The one who is obliged to spend on the infant, whether male or female, is obliged to spend on the child’s nurse, because the child is nourished by the milk produced by the nurse, and that can only happen if she is nourished. So it is obligatory to spend on the nurse because this is in fact spending on the child.” (Al-Mufassal fi Ahkam al-Marah, 9/464)\xa0\nEffects of breastfeeding in establishing the prohibition on marriage\nThe scholars unanimously agree on the effects of breastfeeding in establishing the prohibition on marriage and on making the child the mahram of the woman who breastfeeds him, and making it permissible to look at her and be alone with her, but it does not make it obligatory to spend on the person, or make him an heir or a guardian in cases of marriage.\xa0\nThe reason for this mahram relationship is obvious, because when the infant is nourished by the milk of this woman, his flesh grows on that, so it is as if he is her own child.\xa0\nHence the scholars regarded it as makruh to appoint a disbelieving woman or an immoral woman as a wet-nurse, or a woman who was suffering from a contagious disease, because it may pass to the child.\xa0\nThey regarded it as mustahabb to choose a wet-nurse who was of good character and morals, because breastfeeding changes the child’s nature.\xa0\nIt is better if no one breastfeeds the child but his mother, because that is more beneficial, and that may be obligatory for her if the child will not accept the breast of anyone else.\xa0\nDoctors encourage giving the mother’s milk, especially in the early months.\xa0\nThe wisdom of Allah in creating the nourishment of the child in his mother’s milk has been proven through scientific and medical research.\xa0\nMedical benefits of breastfeeding\xa0\nBreastfeeding brings great benefits. Allah has enjoined breastfeeding in His Book, when He said (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“The mothers shall give suck to their children for two whole years, (that is) for those (parents) who desire to complete the term of suckling.” [Al-Baqarah 2:233]\nSo Allah has stated the child’s right to be breastfed.\xa0\nFourteen hundred years after this verse was revealed, international organizations such as the World Health Organization have issued statement after statement calling on mothers to breastfeed their children, whereas Islam enjoined that fourteen centuries ago.\xa0\nThe benefits of breastfeeding for the child include the following:\xa0\n\nThe mother’s milk is sterile, containing no germs.\xa0\nThe mother’s milk cannot be imitated by any milk prepared from the milk of cows, goats or camels. It is composed in such a way as to meet the child’s needs day after day, from birth until weaning.\xa0\nThe mother’s milk contains sufficient amounts of protein and sugar that suit the infant completely, whereas the proteins in cow’s, goat’s and buffalo’s milk are difficult for the child’s stomach to digest, because they are suited to the offspring of those animals.\xa0\nThe development of children who are breastfed is faster and more complete than that of children who are bottle-fed.\xa0\nThe psychological and emotional bond between the mother and her child.\xa0\nThe mother’s milk contains various elements that are essential to the child’s nourishment, in the right amounts and formats needed by his body, and in a form that is suited to his ability to digest and absorb.\xa0 The nourishing content of the milk is not fixed; it changes day by day according to the child’s needs.\xa0\nThe mother’s milk is kept at a suitable temperature that meets the child’s needs, and can be given to him at any time.\xa0\nBreastfeeding is a natural means of contraception for the mother, and is free of the complications that may accompany use of birth control pills, the coil (IUD) or injections. (From Tawdih al-Ahkam, 5/107)\n\nFor more about the issues related to breastfeeding, please see this section: Breastfeeding.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20759/rulings-and-medical-benefits-of-breastfeeding-in-islam
