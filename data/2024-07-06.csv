478268,"Is speaking to a dead person haram or even shirk, I dont mean praying or seeking for help, I mean only to speak to a dead person and can you give proofs from Quran and Sunnah","['Praise be to Allah.What is prescribed when visiting graves is to greet the occupants with salaam and offer supplication for them, not to talk to them.\nMuslim (975) narrated that Buraydah said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to teach them, when they went out to the graves, to say: Peace be upon you, O people of these abodes, believers and Muslims, and we will, if Allah wills, join you soon. I ask Allah for wellbeing for us and for you.”\nAccording to a report narrated by an-Nasa’i, when the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came to the graveyard, he would say: “Peace be upon you, O people of these abodes, believers and Muslims. Indeed we, if Allah wills, will join you soon. You have gone ahead of us and we will join you. I ask Allah for wellbeing for us and for you.”\nRegardless of whether it is said that the dead can hear or not hear, talking to them as one talks to those who are living is not mentioned in the reports. Moreover, it is a door that leads to a number of bad things, such as becoming attached to them and addressing one’s worries and concerns to them, and perhaps that would lead to believing that they know the unseen, or it would lead to calling upon them and asking of them.\nIf speaking to the dead was a good thing, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his companions would have done that before us. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{This day I have perfected for you your religion and completed My favor upon you and have approved for you Islam as religion}\xa0[Al-Ma’idah 5:3].\nIbn al-Majishun said: I heard Malik say: Whoever introduces an innovation into Islam, thinking that it is good, is claiming that Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) betrayed the trust, because Allah says: {This day I have perfected for you your religion} [al-Ma’idah 5:3]. So whatever was not part of the religion on that day cannot be part of the religion today.""(Al-I‘tisam by ash-Shatibi 1/64).\nBased on that, the one who visits graves should adhere to what is mentioned in the religious texts, so he should greet the occupants with salaam and offer supplication for them, then leave.\nIf it so happens that someone does speak to the deceased, it cannot be said that it is shirk or that it is prohibited; rather it may be said that it is not prescribed and it may lead to that which is prohibited, so the best is to refrain from doing that.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/478268/is-it-prescribed-to-talk-to-the-dead-when-visiting-graves
504356,"If I put water and soap in the washing machine, then I put dirty (impure) clothes in it and wash them once, and a trace of the colour of blood still remains, do all the clothes become impure and does the washing machine become impure, and does the hand become impure that touched the clothes when they were wet? If we put other clothes in the washing machine, do they also become impure? If that is the case, then almost all the clothes and household items have become impure, so what should I do?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nWe have previously discussed the impurity (najasah) of blood in the answer to question no. 114018 .\nSecondly:\nIt seems that what is meant by your saying “a trace of the colour of blood still remains” is that there is a slight trace of the colour of blood remaining on the garment after washing it. This trace may be overlooked.\nIt was narrated by Imam Ahmad in al-Musnad (14/371-372) and by Abu Dawud (365) from Abu Hurayrah that Khawlah bint Yasar came to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and said: O Messenger of Allah, I only have one garment, and I wear it when I am menstruating; what should I do?\nHe said: “When you become pure, wash it then pray in it.”\nShe said: What if the (traces of) blood have not disappeared?\nHe said: “Water is sufficient for you and the traces will do any harm.”\nIt was classed as hasan by the commentators on al-Musnad, and classed as sahih by al-Albani in Irwa’ al-Ghaleel (1/189).\nAd-Darimi (1052) narrated from ‘A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that a woman said to her: There may be blood on the garment, so I wash it, but it does not disappear; should I cut it out? She said: Water is a means of purification.\nFor more information, please see the answers to questions no. 438695 and 163825 .\nBased on that, this garment may be deemed to be pure (tahir), and the impurity does not make the washing machine or the clothes in it impure.\nIf you were uncertain because of persistent intrusive thoughts (waswasah), we advise you not to get carried away with them; rather you should put a stop to them and ignore them, for when they take hold, they will cause you too much trouble.\n\xa0And Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/504356/if-the-traces-of-blood-remain-after-washing-a-garment-in-the-washing-machine-do-the-other-garments-also-become-impure-najis
49897,"We are going to go for `Umrah at the end of Sha`ban and the beginning of Ramadan, in sha Allah.","['Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with repeating `Umrah . The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) encouraged us to do `Umrah and he did not define the time period that should elapse between two `Umrahs.\xa0\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Mughni:\xa0\n“There is nothing wrong with doing `Umrah several times in the year . That was narrated from `Ali, Ibn `Umar, Ibn `Abbas, Anas, `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with them), and `Ata’, Tawus, `Ikrimah and Ash-Shafi`i (may Allah have mercy on them), because `Aishah did `Umrah twice in one month on the command of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “From one `Umrah to another is expiation for whatever (sins) come between them.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim) \xa0\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked in Majmu` Al-Fatawa (17/432): Is it permissible to perform `Umrah repeatedly in Ramadan, seeking the reward for that?\n\xa0He replied:\xa0\n“There is nothing wrong with that. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “From one `Umrah to another is expiation for whatever (sins) come between them, and an accepted Hajj brings no less a reward than Paradise.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 1773 and Muslim, 1349)\xa0\nIf a person does `Umrah three or four times, there is nothing wrong with that. At the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), at the Farewell Pilgrimage, `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) did `Umrah twice within a space of less than twenty days.\xa0\nAnd the Standing Committee was asked (11/337):\xa0\nI live in a town 100 kilometers away from Makkah. In Ramadan every year I go to Makkah for `Umrah, and I pray Jumu`ah and `Asr there, then I go back to my town. I discussed that with some of my brothers and they said that it is not permissible to do `Umrah every week in Ramadan.\xa0\nThey replied:\xa0\n“If the situation is as you describe, that is permissible, because there is no text that specifies the length of time that should elapse between one `Umrah and the next.\xa0\nSome scholars are of the view that time should be allowed between two `Umrahs for hair to grow that the pilgrim can shave in the second `Umrah. This time period is approximately one week or ten days.\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti` (7/242):\xa0\n“Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) said: he should not do `Umrah until his head has turned black with hair.\xa0\nBased on this, what many people do nowadays of performing `Umrah repeatedly, especially in the month of Ramadan every day, or once each day and once each night, is contrary to what the Salaf used to do.\xa0\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Mughni:\xa0\n“`Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) said (`Umrah may be done) once each month. When his hair had grown back, Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) would go out and do `Umrah again. Both reports were narrated by Ash-Shafi`i (may Allah have mercy on him) in his Musnad. `Ikrimah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: He should do `Umrah when his hair can be shaved by the razor. `Ata’ said: If he wishes he can do `Umrah twice each month. Ahmad said: If he does `Umrah, then he has to shave his head or cut his hair. In ten days he can shave his head.”\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 26/45:\xa0\n“What Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) stated is that it is not recommended to repeat `Umrah often from Makkah or elsewhere , rather one should allow time in between for the hair to grow back so that it can be shaved.”\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/49897/can-you-do-umrah-twice-in-one-journey
