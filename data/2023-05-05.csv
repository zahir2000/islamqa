145198,"In the hadith it says that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever hears a man making a lost property announcement in the mosque, let him say: May Allah not restore it to you, for the mosques were not built for this purpose.” In the light of this hadith, if someone loses something valuable in the mosque and does not announce it – rather he tells the imam or the caretaker – do they come under the prohibition that is mentioned in the hadith? Does the prohibition that is mentioned in the hadith apply only to one who loses something, or is it general in meaning, applying to making any kind of announcement in the mosque?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt is not permissible to make lost property announcements in the mosques or to make announcements about items that have been found, because the mosques were not built for that; rather the mosques were built for the remembrance of Allah. Muslim (568) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever hears a man making a lost property announcement in the mosque, let him say: ‘May Allah not restore it to you, for the mosques were not built for this purpose.’”\nMuslim (569) also narrated from Buraydah (may Allah be pleased with him) that a man made a lost property announcement in the mosque, saying: Has anyone found the red camel? The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “May you not find it. The mosques were only built for that for which they were built.”\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), “May you not find it,” and his instruction to say such words are a punishment to [the one who makes such announcements] for going against his teachings and disobeying him. The one who hears him [making such an announcement] should say: “May you not find it, for the mosques were not built for this.” Or he may say: “May you not find it; the mosques were only built for that for which they were built” – as the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said. End quote.\nIbn ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAllah, may He be exalted, has stated that the mosques are houses which Allah has ordered to be raised and that His name be mentioned therein; exalting Him within them in the morning and the evening [an-Nur 24:36]. It is for this purpose that they were built, so they should be protected from everything for which they were not built.""(Al-Istidhkar\xa02/368).\nAl-Bayhaqi narrated in as-Sunan (20763) that ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) built a public courtyard next to the mosque and called it al-Butayha’. He used to say: Whoever wants to make noise or recite poetry or raise his voice, let him go out to this public courtyard.\nSee: al-Istidhkar (2/368).\nSo whoever wants to make a lost property announcement, let him go outside the mosque, and if he writes on a piece of paper and sticks it on the outside wall of the mosque, there is nothing wrong with that.\nWhoever loses something in the mosque, and wants to tell the imam of the mosque or the mu’adhdhin or the caretaker, so that they can tell the one who finds it who it belongs to, and the like, there is nothing wrong with that, if he speaks to him privately.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe mosques were not built for the making of lost property announcements or buying and selling; rather they were built for the worship of Allah, for prayer, dhikr, circles of knowledge and the like.\nAs for writing announcements on pieces of paper and posting them in the mosque, if that is on the outside wall, there is nothing wrong with it, or if it is on an outer door, there is nothing wrong with it. As for posting them inside, that is not appropriate, because it is akin to speaking, and because it may distract people who look at the notice and read it.\nWhat appears to be the case to us is that it is not permissible, because posting notices in the mosque is the same as making lost property announcements. But if it is written on the outside wall, or it is written on the door and is outside the mosque, there is nothing wrong with that.""(Fatawa Nur ‘ala ad-Darb\xa0 2/709).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAs Allah has stated that the mosques are His houses, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) described them in the same way, and they are houses which Allah has ordered to be raised, they have sanctity, there are rulings which apply to them, and they should be respected.\nOne of the rulings regarding mosques is that it is not permissible to buy and sell in them, whether on a small scale or a large scale. Similarly, it is not permissible to make lost property announcements in them, when a man comes and says: I have lost such and such, such as a wallet. This is haram and is not permissible even if you think it likely that it was stolen in the mosque; you should not say, How can I get it back? Go and sit at the door of the mosque, outside the mosque, and say: May Allah reward you, I have lost such and such.\nThe point is that the mosques must be respected.(Sharh Riyadh as-Salihin\xa0 p. 2014).\nThe scholars of the Permanent Committee said:\nHe can post a notice outside the door of the mosque, in a specific spot, so that people can read it.""(Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah\xa0 5/275).\nSecondly:\nThe prohibition is general in meaning and applies to all announcements made in the mosque, except announcements having to do with acts of worship – there is nothing wrong with that.\nThe scholars of the Permanent Committee said:\nIt is not permissible to take the mosques, or any of their facilities, or the external courtyards and precincts that belong to them, as places to set up noticeboards, advertisements and other commercial signage, whether that is for schools, factories, companies or otherwise. That is because the mosques have only been built for the worship of Allah, may He be exalted, through prayer, dhikr, learning and teaching Islamic knowledge, reciting Qur’an and other religious matters.\nSo they should be protected from the things mentioned, and their sanctity should be preserved. We should be keen not to distract people with things that will divert them from worshipping Allah, may He be exalted, and focusing on the hereafter.""(Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah\xa05/276-277).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\nAn announcement was made in one of the mosques that iftar would be provided for everyone who wanted to fast every Thursday. What is the ruling on that?\nHe replied: There is nothing wrong with this announcement, because it is an announcement which calls people to something good, and the purpose behind it is not buying or selling. What is prohibited is making announcements about buying and selling, or renting and hiring, which are things for which the mosques were not built. As for calling people to something good, feeding people and giving charity, there is nothing wrong with that. End quote.\nSee the answer to question no. 3468 .\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) was also asked: What is the ruling on posting some advertisement in the mosque, such as an advertisement about a trip for Hajj or ‘umrah, or advertisements about lectures and lessons?\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) replied: If the advertisement has to do with an act of worship, there is nothing wrong with it, because acts of worship are things that draw people closer to Allah, and the mosques were built for the worship of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted.\nBut if the advertisement has to do with worldly matters, then it is not prohibited. Rather it may be advertised via posters on the outside wall of the mosque. Hajj group trips are a worldly matter, so we do not think that they should be advertised inside the mosque.\nCircles of dhikr – such as courses and classes on Islamic knowledge – are pure good, so there is nothing wrong with announcing them inside the mosque, because they are something good.""(Sharh Manzumah al-Qawa‘id al-Fiqhiyyah\xa0 p. 52).\nAnd Allah knows best.\nSee also the answer\xa0to question\xa0no.\xa0138263 .']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/145198/it-is-not-permissible-to-make-lost-property-announcements-or-post-notices-about-lost-property-in-the-mosque
309498,"Yesterday I decided to make up a missed fast, because it was getting very late. But my intention at night was that if I got up and ate sahur, I would fast. But then I fell asleep and I got up for Fajr prayer [after dawn had broken] and I did not eat sahur. Do I have to refrain from eating and drinking? Is it permissible for me not to fast? Is my making up the fast regarded as valid, if I refrain from eating and drinking, because I restricted my intention by stipulating a condition that I would eat sahur?","['Praise be to Allah.Obligation of forming the intention the night before observing an obligatory fast\nIt is obligatory to form the intention the night before for every obligatory fast, which includes making up missed Ramadan fasts, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever did not intend to fast before dawn, there is no fast for him.” Narrated by Abu Dawud (2454), at-Tirmidhi (730) and an-Nasa’i (2331). According to the version narrated by an-Nasa’i: “Whoever does not form the intention to fast at night, before dawn, there is no fast for him.” This hadith was classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud.\nAt-Tirmidhi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: What this means, according to some of the scholars, is that there is no [valid] fast for the one who does not form the intention to fast before dawn breaks, in Ramadan, or when making up a missed Ramadan fast, or when fasting in fulfilment of a vow, because if he does not form the intention from the night before, it is not valid [as an obligatory fast].\nIn the case of voluntary fasts, on the other hand, it is permissible to form the intention to fast after dawn has broken. This is the view of ash-Shafa‘i, Ahmad and Ishaq. End quote.\nThe view of Abu Hanifah (may Allah have mercy on him) is that the fast is valid if the intention is formed on the same day.\nIbn Qudamah said: If it is an obligatory fast – such as fasting in Ramadan, in the month itself or making up a missed Ramadan fast, or fasting in fulfilment of a vow or as an act of expiation – it is stipulated that the intention should be formed the night before, according to our imam, and Malik, and ash-Shafa‘i.\nAbu Hanifah said: In the case of a Ramadan fast and any fast that one is obliged to do, it is acceptable to form the intention on the same day.""(Al-Mughni\xa0 3/109).\nIs it valid to observe a make-up fast with an uncertain intention?\nIf your intention was that if you got up and ate sahur, then you would fast, this is an uncertain intention, with which the fast is not valid [as an obligatory fast].\nIt says in al-Furu‘ (4/459): According to our madhhab, if a person is uncertain about not fasting, or he intends that he will break his fast at a particular time, or that if he finds food he will eat, otherwise he will continue his fast, then by analogy with the difference of opinion regarding prayer, it was said that this renders the fast invalid, because his intention was not firm. Hence it is not valid to start fasting with such an [uncertain] intention. End quote.\nSome of the jurists regarded the fast of one who says, “If tomorrow is Ramadan, then I will fast” as valid, because he does not know whether tomorrow will be Ramadan, so his hesitation is based on uncertainty as to whether it will be proven that the month has begun, not on uncertainty in his intention as to whether he will fast or not. Hence if one for whom it is permissible not to fast says on some night in Ramadan: “Tomorrow maybe I will fast and maybe I will not fast,” then he decides after dawn has broken that he will fast, his fast is not valid because of the uncertainty in his intention.""(Ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘\xa0 6/362).\nBased on that, if you got up before the adhan of Fajr and formed the intention to fast, your fast is valid.\nIf you got up after the adhan, then your fast is not valid as a make-up fast, because your intention was conditional and was not firm.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/309498/she-intended-that-if-she-got-up-and-ate-sahur-then-she-would-fast-to-make-up-a-missed-ramadan-fast-but-then-she-got-up-after-dawn-had-broken-is-her-fast-valid
