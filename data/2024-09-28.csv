243116,Is it permissible for the woman who is observing ‘iddah to dye her grey hairs?,"['Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible for the woman who is observing ‘iddah following the death of her husband to dye her grey hairs, because that comes under the heading of adornment, which is disallowed for her for the duration of the mourning period.\nThis is what it says in the Sunnah, and the scholars are unanimously agreed on that.\nAbu Dawud (3204) and an-Nasa’i (3535) narrated from Umm Salamah, the wife of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), that he said: “The woman whose husband has recently died should not wear clothes dyed with safflower or red clay (mishq), or wear jewellery, or dye her hair with henna, or apply kohl to her eyes.” Al-Albani classed it as authentic in Irwa’ al-Ghalil, 2129.\nSee: ‘Awn al-Ma`bud bi Sharh Abi Dawud.\nIbn al-Mundhir said in al-Awsat (9/571):\nOne of the things that all of the scholars from whom we acquired knowledge disapproved of [for a recently-widowed woman who is still in mourning] is dyeing their hair.\nThose from whom we narrated the view that it is not allowed for the woman in mourning to dye her hair include: Ibn ‘Umar, Umm Salamah, Sa`id ibn al-Musayyib and `Urwah ibn az-Zubayr.

175551,"Recently I was appointed as an imam in a mosque, temporarily, and I started to lead the people in prayer. According to the best of my knowledge, there are two opinions regarding the matter of saying the Basmalah (i.e., the phrase “Bismillah Ar-Rahman Ar-Rahim (In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful)”) out loud in the prayer, and the more correct opinion is that it is not to be said out loud, so I did not say it out loud. But the people are upset about that and they have started to talk about this and complain behind my back; they are saying: “Why does this imam not say the Basmalah? He should do the same as the other imams who came before.” They also criticise me for not reciting some Surahs that are customarily recited on certain days, such as reciting Surat Al-Falaq and An-Nas in Maghrib prayer on Fridays. I am trying to ignore such matters, but I do not want to stir up trouble or be the cause of trouble being stirred up. I can easily resign from this position and delegate it to someone else, because it is a temporary post after all.","['Praise be to Allah.Importance of following the Sunnah Wisdom and Kindness\nWe appreciate your keenness to follow the Sunnah of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in his prayer, and we appreciate your asking for the ruling on going along with the worshippers in that which they are used to. You have done well, because some of those who follow the Sunnah think that they do not need to be gentle or kind when advising people! Even if the application of the Sunnah – according to what they think is more correct – causes trouble and creates enmity and division among the Muslims, they do not hesitate to insist on applying it, no matter what the negative consequences to which that may lead. Undoubtedly this is wrong and it is not the way of the leading scholars of Ahl As-Sunnah, in the past or more recently, as we shall see below.\nReciting the Basmalah Loudly in Prayer\nUndoubtedly saying Bismillah out loud in Al-Fatihah in the prayer is permissible; it is not a Bid`ah (innovation) or prohibited. But most of the time in his prayer, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not pronounce it out loud; rather he recited it quietly.\nIt was narrated from Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and Abu Bakr and `Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both) began the prayer with the words “Al-hamdu Lillahi Rabbi l-`Alamin (Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds).” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 743)\nAccording to a report narrated by Ahmad (12868), “They did not recite out loud the words `Bismillah Ar-Rahman Ar-Rahim (In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful).`”\nThis is the view of the Hanafis and Hanbalis. The Shafi`is differed from them and said that it is Sunnah to recite it out loud, even though the proven Sunnah is not to recite Bismillah out loud. But there is nothing wrong with reciting it out loud, especially if their Madhhab is that it is to be recited out loud, so as to soften their hearts.\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n… Nevertheless the correct view is that it is not to be recited out loud, although it is prescribed to recite it out loud if that serves a definite interest. Hence it is prescribed for the imam to do that – sometimes – for example, to teach the people who are praying behind him. It is permissible for the worshippers to recite a few words out loud sometimes, and it is also permissible for a man to forego something that is preferable, in order to soften hearts and unite people, lest they be put off from what is in their best interests. For example, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) decided not to rebuild the Ka`bah on the foundations of Ibrahim, because Quraysh had only recently left Jahiliyyah behind (and were new in Islam), and he was worried that they may be put off by that. He thought that the issue of uniting people and softening their hearts took precedence over the issue of rebuilding the Ka`bah on the foundations of Ibrahim. Ibn Mas`ud said, when he offered the prayer in full behind `Uthman, although he disliked that and objected to him about it, and he was questioned about that: “Dissent is evil.” Hence the imams or leading scholars, such as Ahmad and others, stated that the same applies in the case of Bismillah, and praying Witr as three continuous Rak`ahs, and other issues in which one may turn from that which is preferable to that which is permissible in the interests of softening the hearts or the obligation of teaching them the Sunnah, and so on. (End quote from Majmu ` Al-Fatawa, 22/436, 437)\nHe (may Allah have mercy on) also said: One may refrain from doing that which is preferable in one’s own opinion, lest the people be put off. The same applies if a man thinks that the Basmalah should be recited out loud, but he is leading some people in prayer who do not think that that is recommended, or vice versa; if he goes along with them, that is fine.\xa0 (End quote from Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 22/268, 269).\nShaykh Muhammad ibn Salih Al-`Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\nWhat is the ruling on reciting the Basmalah out loud?\nHe replied:\nThe more correct view is that the Basmalah should not be recited out loud, and that the Sunnah is to recite it quietly, because it is not part of Al-Fatihah. But if it is recited out loud sometimes, there is nothing wrong with that. In fact some of the scholars said that it should be recited out loud sometimes, because it was recited from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that he used to recite it out loud. But what is proven from him (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is that he did not recite it out loud, and this is the preferred view, that he did not recite it out loud.\nBut if (the Imam) recites it out loud in order to soften the hearts of people whose Madhhab says that it is to be recited out loud, then I hope that there is nothing wrong with that. (End quote from Majmu` Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin, 13/109)\nBased on that, it is permissible for you to recite the Basmalah out loud for those people, either all the time or occasionally, in order to achieve the greater interest, which is to soften their hearts, bring them together and unite them. You could also make the most of this opportunity to teach them something which is more important than practical matters of Fiqh, namely Tawhid (affirmation of the Oneness of Allah) and that which nullifies it, and shirk (association of others with Allah) and that which lead to it. Your staying and reciting the Basmalah out loud is undoubtedly better for the people than leaving them and letting your place be taken by an ignorant imam who may mislead the people, lead them into ignorance and divert them from sound Islamic knowledge.\nReciting certain Surahs and verses in certain prayers\nThere is nothing wrong with always reciting certain Surahs and verses in certain prayers, in two cases:\n\nIf it is proven that it is prescribed to always recite them in certain prayers, such as Surat As-Sajdah and Al-Insan in Fajr prayer on Friday. Based on that, there is nothing wrong with always reciting these prayers in Fajr every Friday.\nWhen there is no proof that it is prescribed to always recite them, such as if the Imam always recites the final verses of Surat Al-Baqarah in Maghrib. The Sunnah is that it is not prescribed to always do that, because that is contrary to the practice of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), which was to vary the Surahs recited\xa0 and lest the ignorant think that this was recommended – let alone obligatory – in every Maghrib prayer.\n\nWhen to prioritise unity over strict adherence\nEven though this is the Sunnah, there is no reason why you should not recite what they are used to and always do that for a while, in order to unite the worshippers and not cause division among them, and in order to close the door to any leader of Bid`ah who may seek to misguide them, and in order to endear you and the methodology that you follow to them, so that you may teach them to love the Sunnah and act in accordance with it. With the passage of time, you will be able to phase out that continual practice, as other seekers of knowledge have done in similar cases with worshippers who go against the Sunnah.\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 22186, 21241\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/175551/reciting-bismillah-loudly-in-prayer
133116,"I and two other people tricked an insurance company with a fake accident. We had agreed amongst ourselves to share out the money, which is approximately 21,000, with each of us taking 7,000. I went and collected the cheque and cashed it, and I took 1,000 from it. What was left was 20,000, which the second guy took on the basis that he would divide it into three equal parts between us, then after that he denied that. I only took 1,000, and all ties between us have been cut off since that day. I have repented to Allah, and I want to return the money. Should I return only the amount that I took, which was only 1,000, or what?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nAllah, may He be exalted, has opened the gates of His mercy to people, and He has told us that whoever repents from sin, He will turn in mercy to him and forgive him his sin. He, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And whoever does a wrong or wrongs himself but then seeks forgiveness of Allah will find Allah Forgiving and Merciful}\n[an-Nisa’ 4:11]\n{Say, O My servants who have transgressed against themselves [by sinning], do not despair of the mercy of Allah. Indeed, Allah forgives all sins. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful}\n[az-Zumar 39:53].\nOne of the conditions of repentance, if the matter has to do with the rights of people, is that their rights should be restored to them.\nThe conditions of perfect, valid repentance are:\n\nGiving up the sin\nRegretting what has happened in the past\nResolving not to go back to it.\n\nIf repentance is from having wronged people with regard to their wealth or honour, then a fourth condition is added, namely:\n\nSeeking pardon from the one who was wronged, asking for his forgiveness or giving him what is rightfully his.\n\nSecondly:\nTricking anyone by means of deceit and cheating in order to take the wealth of others unlawfully is a major sin, and the one who does that has combined two grievous sins: taking money unlawfully, and deceiving and cheating.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {O you who have believed, do not consume one another’s wealth unjustly\xa0but only [in lawful] business by mutual consent…} [an-Nisa’ 4:29].\nIt was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever deceives (people) does not belong to me.” (Narrated by Muslim, 102).\nThirdly:\nIf the action of tricking and cheating the insurance company, on the basis of which they issued the cheque, was done with the participation of all of you, each according to his role, whether his role in the deceit was small or great, then you three should all carry the burden of your actions and your plan to share the ill-gotten money among you equally, regardless of in whose name the cheque was written, and also regardless of what each person actually got. Even if you did not take any of this money, and your friend cheated you and took it all, that was a separate act of betrayal, and your burden of sin is because you all tricked the insurance company and took its wealth.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf a group of people take part in killing a person, they must pay one diyah (blood money), a responsibility to be shared among them, because it is a payment for something that has been destroyed that can be divided, so the burden is to be shared among them, as in the case of a financial penalty. (End quote from al-Kafi (4/3).\nAl-Bahuti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf a group of people participate in killing a game animal [whilst they are in ihram], then they must offer one penalty, because it is a penalty for what they killed, which varies according to what animal was killed, and the penalty to be paid can be divided. So it is one penalty, as in the case of compensation paid for destroyed property or blood money (diyah). (End quote from Kash-shaf al-Qina`, 2/467).\nFourthly:\nDo you have to return the money that you owe to the insurance company, or can you spend it on charitable causes on the grounds that the activities and dealings of commercial insurance companies are prohibited? What appears to be the case is that the amount that you owe must be returned to them, and the fact that their activities are prohibited does not make it permissible to spend their wealth on charitable causes. Rather it must be returned to them, so that they can regain possession of it.\nShaykh Yusuf ash-Shubayli (may Allah preserve him) was asked:\nIs it permissible to trick insurance companies in order to receive compensation?\nHe replied:\nIt is not permissible to trick insurance companies by lying to them in order to take compensation unlawfully. If someone does that, the wealth that he takes is stolen wealth, which he must return to the company from which he took it. It is not valid to dispose of it by spending it on charitable causes; rather he must return it to the insurance company. (End quote from the shaykh’s website)\nFifthly:\nIt is not stipulated that the one who wants to return something to its rightful owners must disclose his identity, because the aim is to return the thing to its rightful owners.\nIf he is afraid of being charged, or he is concerned about the consequences of disclosing what he did, then he should look for an appropriate way that will enable him to maintain his dignity and restore the thing to its rightful owners, without bringing embarrassment upon himself. For example, he can send the money by mail, or delegate someone to deliver it, or he can deposit it in their account.\nSee also the answer to question no. 31234.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/133116/they-deceived-the-insurance-company-and-received-unlawful-money-from-them-what-should-the-one-who-has-repented-do
71236,"If a calamity befalls the Muslim in his health or his wealth, etc, what is the correct way of dealing with it according to Islam?","['Praise be to Allah.Calamities and disasters are a test\nCalamities and disasters are a test, and they are a sign of Allah’s love for a person, because they are like medicine: even though it is bitter, despite its bitterness you give it to the one whom you love – and for Allah is the highest description. In the authentic Hadith it says: “The greatest reward comes with the greatest trial. When Allah loves a people He tests them. Whoever accepts that wins His pleasure but whoever is discontent with that earns His wrath.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 2396 and Ibn Majah, 4031; classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Tirmidhi)\nAre calamities good for the believer?\nCalamities are good for the believer in the sense that reward is stored up for him the Hereafter thereby; how can it be otherwise when he is raised in status thereby and his bad deeds are expiated? The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When Allah wills good for His slave, He hastens the punishment for him in this world, and when Allah wills ill for His slave, he withholds the punishment for his sins from him until he comes with all his sins on the Day of Resurrection.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 2396; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Tirmidhi)\nAl-Hasan Al-Basri (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Do not resent the calamities that come and the disasters that occur, for perhaps in something that you dislike will be your salvation, and perhaps in something that you prefer will be your doom.”\nAl-Fadl ibn Sahl (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “There is a blessing in calamity that the wise man should not ignore, for it erases sins, gives one the opportunity to attain the reward for patience, dispels negligence, reminds one of blessings at the time of health, calls one to repent and encourages one to give charity.\nThrough calamity the believer seeks reward, and there is no way to attain it but through patience, and there is no way to be patient except with resolute faith and strong will.\nRemember the words of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “How wonderful is the affair of the believer, for his affairs are all good, and this applies to no one but the believer. If something good happens to him, he is thankful for it and that is good for him. If something bad happens to him, he bears it with patience and that is good for him.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2999)\nWhat to Say When Calamity Strikes You\nSo if calamity befalls a Muslim, he should say Inna Lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji`un (Verily to Allah we belong and unto Him is our return), and say the Du`a’s that have been narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).\nHow wonderful are those moments in which a person turns to his Lord and knows that He alone is the One Who grants relief from distress. How great is the relief when it comes after hardship. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{but give glad tidings to As- Sabirun (the patient). \xa0Who, when afflicted with calamity, say: ‘Truly, to Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return.’ They are those on whom are the Salawat (i.e. who are blessed and will be forgiven) from their Lord, and (they are those who) receive His Mercy, and it is they who are the guided ones.} [Al-Baqarah 2:155-157]\nMuslim (918) narrated that Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “There is no Muslim who is stricken with a calamity and says what Allah has enjoined – ‘Verily to Allah we belong and unto Him is our return. O Allah, reward me for my affliction and compensate me with something better’ – but Allah will compensate him with something better.”\nShe said: When Abu Salamah died, I said: Who among the Muslims is better than Abu Salamah, the first household to migrate to join the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)? Then I said it, and Allah compensated me with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).\nHow to deal with calamities\nThere are things which, if the one who is stricken with calamity thinks about them, that will make the calamity easier for him to bear.\nIn his valuable book Zad Al-Ma`ad (4/189-195), Ibn Al-Qayyim has mentioned several things, including the following:\n\nIf he looks at what has befallen him, he will find that what his Lord has left for him is similar to it or better than it, and if he is patient and accepts it, He has stored up for him something that is many times greater than what he has lost through this calamity, and if He willed He could have made the calamity even greater.\nThe fire of calamity can be extinguished by thinking of those who have been hit even harder. Let him look to his right, does he see anything but calamity? Then let him look to his left, does he see anything but loss? If he were to look at the people around him, he would not see anything but people who are tested, either by missing out on something that they like, or by having something happen to them that which they dislike. The pains of this world are like dreams or like a passing shadow. If you laugh a little you will weep a lot, and if you are happy for a day you will be miserable for a lifetime, and if you have what you want for a little while, you will be deprived for a long time. There is no day of happiness but it is followed by a day of pain. Ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: For every moment of joy there is a moment of sorrow, and no house is filled with joy but it will be filled with sorrow. And Ibn Sirin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: There is never any laughter but there comes weeping after it.\nIt should be noted that panicking will not make the calamity go away, and in fact it makes it worse.\nIt should be noted that missing out on the reward for patience and surrender, which is mercy and guidance that Allah has granted as the reward for patience and turning to Him (by saying Inna Lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji`un (Verily to Allah we belong and unto Him is our return)), is worse than the calamity itself.\nIt should be noted that panicking makes one’s enemy rejoice and makes one’s friend feel sad; it makes Allah angry and makes the devils happy; it destroys reward and weakens resolve. If he is patient, seeks reward, strives to please Allah, to make his friend happy and to make his enemy sad, and seeks to relieve his brothers of their burdens and to console them before they console him, this is steadfastness and a sign of perfection – not slapping one’s cheeks, rending one’s garment, wishing for death and being discontent with the divine decree.\nIt should be noted that what comes after being patient and seeking reward is pleasure and joy that is many times greater than what he could have got from keeping what he lost. Sufficient for him is the “house of praise” that will be built for him in Paradise as a reward for his praising his Lord and turning to Him (by saying Inna Lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji`un (Verily to Allah we belong and unto Him is our return)). So let him decide which of the two calamities is greater: a calamity in this world, or the calamity of missing out on the house of praise in eternal Paradise.\xa0 In At-Tirmidhi it is narrated in a report that is attributed to the Prophet\xa0 (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “On the Day of Resurrection people will wish that their skins had been cut with scissors in this world, when they see the reward of those who were struck with calamity.” One of the salaf said: Were it not for the calamities of this world, we would come empty-handed on the Day of Resurrection.\nIt should be noted that the One Who is testing him is the Most Wise and the Most Merciful, and that He – may He be glorified – did not send this calamity in order to destroy him or cause him pain or finish him off, rather He is checking on him, testing his patience, acceptance and faith; it is so that He may hear his Du`a’ and supplication, so that He may see him standing before Him, seeking protection, filled with humility and complaining to Him.\nIt should be noted that were it not for the trials and tribulations of this world, a person could develop arrogance, self-admiration, a pharaonic attitude and hardheartedness which would lead to his doom in this world and in the Hereafter. It is a sign of the mercy of the Most Merciful that He checks on him from time to time with the remedy of calamity so as to protect him from these diseases, to keep his submission and servitude sound, and to eliminate all bad elements that may lead to his doom. Glory be to the One Who shows mercy by means of testing, and tests by means of blessing, as it is said:\n\nAllah may bless us with calamities even if that is hard, and Allah may test some people with blessings.\n\nIt should be noted that the bitterness of this world is the essence of sweetness in the Hereafter, as Allah will turn the former into the latter. Similarly the sweetness of this world is the essence of bitterness in the Hereafter. It is better to move from temporary bitterness to eternal sweetness than the other way round. If this is still not clear to you, then think of what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Paradise is surrounded with difficulties, and Hell is surrounded with desires.”\n\nWhat happens if you respond well to calamity?\nIn many cases, if a person responds well to calamity, they understand that it is a blessing and a gift, not a test.\nShaykh Al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyah] (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “A calamity that makes you turn to Allah is better for you than a blessing which makes you forget the remembrance of Allah.”\nSufyan (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “What a person dislikes may be better for him than what he likes, because what he dislikes causes him to call upon Allah, whereas what he likes may make him heedless.”\nIbn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) regarded his imprisonment as a blessing that had been caused by his enemies.\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “One day he – meaning Ibn Taymiyah – said to me: What can my enemies do to me? My garden is in my heart; wherever I go it is with me and never leaves me. My detainment is seclusion (an opportunity for worship), my being killed is martyrdom, and being expelled from my city is a journey.\nHe used to say of his detainment in the citadel: If I were to spend the fill of this citadel in gold, that would not be sufficient to express my gratitude for this blessing. Or he said: That would not be sufficient to reward them for what they have brought to me of goodness.\nWhen he was imprisoned, he used to say when prostrating: “O Allah, help me to remember You, give thanks to You and to worship You well. Ma sha Allah. He said to me (Ibn Al-Qayyim) one day: The one who is really detained is the one who keeps his heart away from his Lord, and the real prisoner is the one who is captive to his whims and desires. When he entered the citadel and was within its walls, he looked at it and said: {So a wall will be put up between them, with a gate therein. Inside it will be mercy, and outside it will be torment} [Al-Hadid 57:13]. Allah knows that I have never seen anyone who was more content with his life than him, despite all the hardship that he experienced, and the lack of luxury and comfort, in fact the opposite of that, and despite the imprisonment, threats and exhaustion that he faced; despite all of that, he was the happiest of people with his life, the most content, the most courageous, the most satisfied. You could see the signs of joy and happiness in his face. When we felt afraid and were expecting calamity, and we had nowhere to turn, we would go to him and as soon as we saw him and heard his voice, all those fears disappeared and were replaced with contentment, courage, certainty and tranquillity. Glory be to the One who showed some of His slaves His Paradise before they met Him, and opened its gates to them when they were still in this world of deeds and actions, so some of its breezes and fragrance came to them, which made them devote their energy to seeking it and competing in attaining it.” (End quote from Al-Wabil As-Sayyib, p. 110)\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/71236/what-to-say-when-calamity-strikes-you
