265477,"My husband died a short while ago, and I have two daughters. My parents had to come and live with me, but that means that my father has to travel a long way to his work. I have money that belongs to me and my two daughters; is it permissible for me to use some of this money to buy a three-wheeled motorcycle for my father (because he goes around and sells goods) on the basis that he is our provider, for me and my daughters? Please note that in a few months’ time I will start to receive my husband’s pension, in sha Allah.","[""Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt is permissible to use some of your money to buy a motorbike for your father, because it is valid for an adult of sound mind to give up some of his or her money for nothing in return.\nSecondly:\nIt is not permissible to give any of the orphan’s wealth as a loan or gift, or any other kind of giving that brings no benefit to the orphan, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And do not approach the orphan's property except in a way that is best}\xa0[al-An‘am 6:152]\n{They ask you concerning [the property of] orphans. Say: The best thing to do is to manage it in their best interests}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:220].\nIt says in al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (43/198): The Hanafis, Malikis, Shafa‘is and Hanbalis are of the view that the guardian who is in charge of an orphan and his wealth has no right to give away the wealth of a minor, whether that is by way of charity or a gift for nothing in return, because giving away some of the minor’s wealth brings him no benefit, and it is contrary to the purpose of being in charge of and taking care of an orphan, which is to protect his wealth and manage it in a manner that will bring benefit to the minor, based on the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And do not approach the orphan's property except in a way that is best}\xa0[al-An‘am 6:152].\nThus it is forbidden to approach the orphan’s wealth or property except in a manner that will serve the orphan’s interests. Giving away the money does not serve any interest for the orphan; rather it is disposing of his wealth in a manner other than that which Allah has enjoined. Therefore it is forbidden and not allowed to do that. End quote.\nBased on that, it is not permissible to take anything of your daughters’ wealth except in a manner that will clearly or most likely benefit them.\nYou mentioned two things:\n1. That your father will use this motorbike for work, and he is your provider.\n2. In a few months’ time, you will start to receive your husband’s pension, so you will no longer need your father’s support.\nSo long as the two girls have wealth of their own, their maintenance should come from their wealth and there is no need for their grandfather to spend on them. In this case, he is not obliged to spend on them from his own wealth.\nBut if what will be taken from the girls’ wealth to buy the motorbike will bring extra benefit to them as a result of your father working for these few months, or the benefit will continue after that, such as if this motorbike will increase your father’s business or increase his profits so that he will be able to spend on them in a better way, then there is nothing wrong with giving him a loan from the girls’ wealth, because that serves an interest for them.\nBut if it will not bring them any extra benefit – rather it will bring some benefit that is equal or less – then it is not permissible to take anything from their wealth.\nThe basic principle is that it is prohibited to consume an orphan’s wealth, and it is obligatory to spend from his own wealth on what will serve his interests.\nAl-Khatib ash-Sharbini said in Mughni al-Muhtaj (3/151): The guardian should manage the orphan’s wealth or property in a manner that serves the latter’s interests, and this is obligatory, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And do not approach the orphan's property except in a way that is best}\xa0[al-An‘am 6:152]\n{if you mix their affairs with yours, then they are your brothers; but Allah knows who is dishonest and who is honest}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:220].\nTherefore managing their wealth in a way that does not bring any benefit or cause any harm is not allowed, because it serves no interest, and that is indeed the case.\nThe guardian must protect the child’s wealth from being wasted, and he must invest it in such a way as to replace what he spends on maintenance and other things, if possible. End quote.\nThe Permanent Committee for Ifta’ (14/221) was asked the following question: He has money that belongs to orphans, and this money is deposited in one of the banks in Saudi Arabia without interest, for the orphans. Someone is asking for a loan from this money, for an amount of sixty thousand riyals, and at that time he said: I shall pay it back in instalments over thirty-five months, in monthly instalments of 2,400 riyals. He said: I will willingly give the orphans 12,000 riyals in addition to what I borrow of their money; I will do this voluntarily, and not as a stipulated condition. As long as I going to keep this money for a while, perhaps there is nothing wrong with this extra amount that I want to give.\nThey replied: If the situation is as you stated, it is not permissible for you to lend any of the orphans’ wealth, either to the person you mention or anyone else, and regardless of whether there is the intention to give them something extra or not. Rather it is prescribed for you to seek someone who will do trade with it for a known percentage of the profit, such as half and the like, on the condition that the person must be trustworthy.\nAnd Allah is the source of strength. May Allah send blessings and peace upon Muhammad and his family and companions.\nShaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn ‘Abdillah ibn Baz, Shaykh ‘Abd ar-Razzaq ‘Afifi, Shaykh ‘Abdullah ibn Ghadyan, Shaykh ‘Abdullah ibn Qa‘ud. End quote.\nConclusion: it is not permissible for you to take anything from their wealth to buy the motorbike for their grandfather, unless that is going to bring them some extra benefit.\nThirdly:\nIt is permissible for the one who is looking after the orphans’ affairs and taking care of them to eat from their wealth on a reasonable basis, if he needs to do that, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{ And do not give the feeble-minded your property, which Allah has made a means of sustenance for you, but provide for them with it and clothe them and speak to them words of appropriate kindness\nAnd test the orphans [in their abilities] until they reach marriageable age. Then if you perceive in them sound judgement, release their property to them. And do not consume it excessively and quickly, [anticipating] that they will grow up. And whoever, [when acting as guardian], is self-sufficient should refrain [from taking a fee]; and whoever is poor - let him take according to what is acceptable. Then when you release their property to them, bring witnesses upon them. And sufficient is Allah as Reckoner}\xa0[an-Nisa’ 4:5-6].\nThe jurists say: He may consume the lesser of two amounts: the wages for one who does the same work, or as much as he needs. In other words, if his work and efforts deserve a fee of one hundred, for example, and what he needs is worth ninety, then he should take ninety.\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/265477/is-it-permissible-to-borrow-from-an-orphans-wealth
287792,"I am always amazed at how the Salaf (early generations) were and how they attained such a high level of faith. When I read about the Karamat (miracles, extraordinary events) that happened to them, I wonder how they were able to reach this high level? How were they able to rid their hearts of the love of worldly gains?","['Praise be to Allah.You have asked about a momentous matter, but it is easy for one for whom Allah makes it easy. Discussing how the Salaf were, and speaking about the great righteous deeds to which they committed themselves, so that they were able to attain this high level of faith , is a discussion that would be very lengthy and could fill many books, but it could all be summed up by noting two essential matters on which all the affairs of the Salaf were based, and whoever adheres to them, there is the hope that he will attain something similar to what they attained, and become one of their group. We ask Allah to make these two things easy for us and for you, and to make us and you steadfast in adhering to them, until we meet Him when He is pleased with us. These two things are:\n\nThe first thing is being keen to follow what the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) brought, and to persevere in adhering to it.\n\nIn order to attain high status before Allah, may He be Exalted, He has stipulated a condition that must be met, namely following that which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) brought. Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Say, [O Muhammad], `If you should love Allah , then follow me, [so] Allah will love you and forgive you your sins. And Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.’” [Al `Imran 3:31]\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, has enjoined us to follow the Messenger, obey him, take him as an ally and love him, and has enjoined that Allah and His Messenger should be dearer to us than all others. He has guaranteed that, through obedience to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and loving him, we may attain the love and honour of Allah. Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Say, [O Muhammad], `If you should love Allah , then follow me, [so] Allah will love you and forgive you your sins. And Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.’” [Al `Imran 3:31]\n“And if you obey him, you will be [rightly] guided.” [An-Nur 24:54]\n“and whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger will be admitted by Him to gardens [in Paradise] under which rivers flow, abiding eternally therein; and that is the great attainment.” [An-Nisa’ 4:13]\nThere are many similar verses in the Quran. No one has the right to drift away from that which is established in the Sunnah, stated in the teachings of Islam, proven in the Quran and Sunnah, and was what the early generations of the ummah adhered to.” (Majmu` Al-Fatawa (1/334)\nThis following cannot be imagined to have happened without learning and understanding that which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) brought. The first step in following Islam is to learn about it from its authentic sources, and to persevere in doing so.\nIt was narrated from Humayd ibn `Abd Ar-Rahman: I heard Mu`awiyah saying in a speech: I heard the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “If Allah intends good for a person, He causes him to understand Islam.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 71 and Muslim, 1037)\nIt was narrated from `Uthman (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The best of you are those who learn the Quran and teach it.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 5027)\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Included in the meaning of the words “The best of you are those who learn the Quran and teach it” is teaching both the letters and their meanings; in fact learning its meanings is the first intended purpose of teaching its letters (and how to recite it). That is what increases faith .” (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 13/403)\nThe way of the early generations was to persevere in learning what the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) brought, then after that they persevered in acting upon what they had learned.\nIt was narrated that Ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: If one of us learned ten verses, he would not go beyond them until he learned their meanings and put them into practice. (Narrated by At-Tabari in his Tafsir, 1/74)\nIt was narrated from Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: We lived for a short time of our lives when the youngest among us would learn about faith before learning the Quran. A Surah would be revealed to Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), so he [the youngest among us] would learn what that Surah said was lawful and prohibited, and what limits it said were to be adhered to, the way you learn the Quran. Then he said: I saw men, one of whom would learn the Quran and recite everything in it, from beginning to end, not knowing what therein was a command and what was a prohibition, or what limits were to be adhered to, reciting it rapidly like broadcasting seeds. (Narrated by Al-Hakim in Al-Mustadrak (1/35) He said: “This is a Hadith which is authentic according to the conditions of the two shaykhs [Al-Bukhari and Muslim], and I do not know of anything wrong with it; Adh-Dhahabi agreed with him)\nIt was narrated that Abu `Abd Ar-Rahman As-Sulami (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Those of the companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) who taught us the Quran told us that they used to learn ten verses from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and they would not learn the next ten until they had learned what those ten verses contained of knowledge and dictated of actions. They said: So we learned knowledge along with how to act upon it. (Narrated by Ahmad in Al-Musnad (38/466); classed as sound by the commentators on Al-Musnad.)\n\nThe second thing is the way in which they followed the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), for they followed him with sincerity that was not contaminated with any corrupt intention, and with certain faith that was not mixed with any doubt.\n\nWhen they learned what the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) brought, they learned it with a sincere intention, and they learned it with certain and steadfast faith . When they acted upon what they had learned, they were entirely sincere in that, and they strove against their evil inclinations, against the impulse to show off, against aiming for worldly gain by means of their knowledge and worship, all of that in accordance with the words of Allah, may He be Exalted (interpretation of the meaning):\n“O you who have believed, fear Allah and be with those who are true.” [At-Tawbah 9:119]\nShaykh `Abd Ar-Rahman As-Sa `di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“and be with those who are true” that is, those who are true in word, deed and conduct, those whose words are true and whose deeds and conduct cannot be but based on truth, devoid of laziness and apathy, free of bad intentions, and based on sincerity and good intentions. For truthfulness leads to righteousness, and righteousness leads to Paradise.\nAllah, may He be Exalted, says elsewhere (interpretation of the meaning): “This is the Day when the truthful will benefit from their truthfulness.” [Al-Ma’idah 5:119] (Tafsir As-Sa`di, p. 355)\nIbn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Virtue cannot be attained by doing a lot of physical deeds; rather it is attained by making those deeds sincerely for Allah, may He be Glorified\xa0 and Exalted; by making them sound and correct in accordance with the Sunnah; and by making one’s emotions and feelings in the heart sincere and connected to Allah.\nThe one who has more knowledge of Allah and of His religion and its rulings and teachings, and has more fear of Him, love of Him and hope in Him, is better than one who is not like that, even if the latter does a lot of righteous deeds and physical actions.\nHence some of the early generations said: Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) did not surpass them by fasting and praying a great deal, rather it was by means of something that he had in his heart… Mention was made to Abu Sulayman of how long the Children of Israel lived and how hard they strove in doing righteous deeds, and that some of the people envied them for that.\nHe said: All that Allah wants of you is sincerity of intention , and sincerely seeking that which is with Him – or words to that effect.\nIbn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said to his companions: You fast and pray more than the companions of Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), yet they were better than you.\nThey said: Why is that?\nHe (may Allah be pleased with him) said: They had less interest than you in worldly gain, and greater desire for the hereafter.” (Majmu` Rasa’il Ibn Rajab, 4/412-413)\nIn conclusion, the way to attain a high level of faith as our righteous forebears (may Allah be pleased with them) did is, firstly, by persevering in seeking to understand what the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) brought, then by persevering in doing what he enjoined and in refraining from what he forbade. All of that is to be done with true sincerity, having no interest in worldly gain, and hoping for the hereafter. The core of the matter is beseeching Allah, may He be Exalted, seeking guidance and steadfastness from Him, for the entire matter is in the hand of Allah, may He be Exalted. You should seek out times when supplications are more likely to be answered, such as the last third of the night, for the Salaf used to seek out these times.\nIt was narrated from Ibn Shihab Az-Zuhri, from Al-Agharr and Abu Salamah ibn `Abd Ar-Rahman, that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Our Lord, blessed be His Name, comes down to the lowest heaven every night when the last third of the night remains, and says: `Who will call upon Me, that I may answer him? Who will ask of Me, that I may give him? Who will ask Me for forgiveness, that I may forgive him?’ And that continues until the break of dawn.” Hence they preferred to pray at the end of the night, rather than at the beginning.\nNarrated by Imam Ahmad in Al-Musnad (13/35); classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Irwa’ Al-Ghalil (2/196)\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/287792/how-the-salaf-attained-strong-faith
218022,"My question has to do with a tradition that is followed here in East Africa and is widespread among the people here. It is celebrating the naming of the newborn, meaning that when a child is born, the people slaughter a sheep or goat, then they cook rice and so on, and offer fizzy drinks, and they serve that to friends and relatives who attend the celebration of the child’s naming. What is the Islamic ruling on this practice? According to my knowledge, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and the Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) did not cook food for the naming of the child, and they did not gather for that purpose.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe Sunnah is to offer the ‘aqiqah for the child on the seventh day, slaughtering two sheep for a boy and one sheep for a girl, because of the report narrated by Abu Dawud (2838) from Samurah ibn Jundub (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Every child is in pledge for his ‘aqiqah, which should be sacrificed for him on the seventh day, and his head should be shaved and he should be given a name.” Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud.\nSecondly:\nThe purpose of the ‘aqiqah is to sacrifice the animal as an act of worship to draw closer to Allah, may He be exalted, and as an act of gratitude for the blessing of being given a child. Whatever you do after that – such as cooking the meat and inviting relatives to eat it, or distributing cooked meat or distributing raw meat, or cooking some of it and distributing some of it raw – all of that is permissible, and there is nothing wrong with it.\nPlease see the answer to question no. 167711 .\nThirdly:\nThe Sunnah with regard to naming the child is that it may be done on the first day or on the seventh day.\nThere is nothing wrong with slaughtering the ‘aqiqah on any day, or naming the child on any day.\nPlease see the answer to question no. 155627 .\nFourthly:\nThere is nothing wrong with celebrating the naming of the child and gathering for that purpose, and offering food and drinks, on the basis that it is a happy occasion, not on the basis that it is Sunnah.\nThe scholars of the Permanent Committee were asked:\nIs it permissible to gather loved ones, neighbours and friends for the naming of the newborn, or is such a celebration regarded as an innovation (bid‘ah) and disbelief (kufr)?\nThey replied: Celebrating the naming of the newborn is not part of the Prophet’s Sunnah, and his companions did not do that at his time. So the one who does that on the grounds that it is an Islamic Sunnah and tradition has introduced something into the religion that is not part of it, and that is regarded as an innovation that is to be rejected, because the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever introduces into this religion of ours anything that is not part of it, it is to be rejected.” Agreed upon. But it does not constitute disbelief (kufr).\nBut in the case of someone who does that by way of expressing joy, or to eat the meat of the ‘aqiqah, and not on the grounds that it is Sunnah, there is nothing wrong with that. It is soundly narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that it is prescribed to slaughter the ‘aqiqah and name the child on the seventh day.""(Fatawa Islamiyyah\xa0 4/490).\nConclusion:\nThe celebration that you mention for the child or for his naming comes under the heading of people’s customs and traditions, which vary from one country to another. There does not seem to be anything wrong with it in principle, for one for whom that is his tradition, or who wants to bring happiness to his family and friends, or to express joy at the blessing that Allah has bestowed upon him.\nThere is nothing wrong with doing the ‘aqiqah on this day and cooking it, or cooking part of it on that day.\nFor more information, please see the answers to questions no. 134163 and 89705 .\nFor information on the rulings on the ‘aqiqah, please see the answers to questions no. 12448 and 60252 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/218022/is-it-permissible-to-celebrate-the-naming-of-the-newborn
9607,What are the attributes of the correct religion?,"[""Praise be to Allah.Are deviant religions and human traditions true or false?\xa0\nEvery member of a faith tradition believes that his community is following the truth. Every follower of a religion believes that his religion is the best religion and the straightest way.\xa0\nWhenever you ask the followers of deviant religions or the followers of man-made traditions about the evidence for their beliefs, they tell you that they found their fathers doing this so they are following in their footsteps, then they tell you stories and reports that have no sound basis and whose texts are not free of faults and discrepancies.\xa0\nThey rely on inherited books of which it is not known who wrote or said them, or in which language they were originally written, or in which land they originated; rather they are a mixture that has been gathered and written in a book that is venerated, then they were passed down from generation to generation with no proper scientific examination of the source of the text or of the text itself.\xa0\nThese unknown books and stories and blind imitation do not provide valid proof with regard to religions and beliefs. Are these deviant religions and human traditions true or false?\xa0\nIt is impossible that they could all be true, because the truth is one; there are not many “truths”. And it is impossible that all these deviant religions and human traditions could have come from Allah and all be true. If they are many, and the truth is one, then which of them is the truth? So there have to be guidelines by which we may recognize the true religion and distinguish it from false religions.\nIf we find that these guidelines apply to a religion, then we will know that it is the truth. If these guidelines or one of them is absent from a religion, then we will know that it is false.\xa0\nHow to distinguish between the true religion and false religions\nThe guidelines by which we distinguish the true religion from false religions:\xa0\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The religion should have come from Allah, revealed through one of the angels to one of His Messengers , to convey it to His slaves, because the true religion is the religion of Allah, and Allah is the One Who will judge mankind and bring them to account on the Day of Resurrection according to the religion which He revealed to them. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Verily, We have sent the Revelation to you (O Muhammad) as We sent the Revelation to Nuh (Noah) and the Prophets after him; We (also) sent the Revelation to Ibrahim (Abraham), Isma’il (Ishmael), Ishaq (Isac), Ya’qub (Jacob), and Al-Asbat [the offspring of the twelve sons of Ya’qub (Jacob)], ‘Isa (Jesus), Ayyoob (Job), Yunus (Jonah), Harun (aron), and Sulayman (Solomon); and to Dawud (David) We gave the Zabur (Psalms)” [An-Nisa’ 4:163]\nAnd Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n\xa0“And We did not send any Messenger before you (O Muhammad) but We revealed to him (saying): La ilaha illa Ana [none has the right to be worshipped but I (Allah)], so worship Me (Alone and none else)” [Al-Anbiya’ 21:25]\xa0\nBased on this, any religion which is introduced by some person who attributes it to himself and not to Allah is undoubtedly a false religion .\xa0\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 It should call for the worship of Allah alone, and forbid Shirk (polytheism or the worship of anything other than Allah). It should also forbid the means that lead to that, because promoting Tawhid (belief in the oneness of Allah) is the basis of the call of all the Prophets and Messengers. Every Prophet said to his people:\xa0\n“Worship Allah! You have no other Ilah (God) but Him” [Al-A’raf 7:73 – interpretation of the meaning]\nBased on this, any religion that includes Shirk and joins others in worship with Him, such as a Prophet, angel or Wali (“saint”) is a false religion, even if its followers attribute it to one of the Prophets.\xa0\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 It should be in accordance with the principles advocated by the Messengers, such as the worship of Allah alone, calling people to His path, and forbidding Shirk, disobedience to parents, unlawful killing and immoral deeds, both hidden and open. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n\xa0“And We did not send any Messenger before you (O Muhammad) but We revealed to him (saying): La ilaha illa Ana [none has the right to be worshipped but I (Allah)], so worship Me (Alone and none else)” [Al-Anbiya’ 21:25]\xa0\n“Say (O Muhammad): Come, I will recite what your Lord has prohibited you from: Join not anything in worship with Him; be good and dutiful to your parents; kill not your children because of poverty — We provide sustenance for you and for them. Come not near to Al-Fawahish (shameful sins and illegal sexual intercourse) whether committed openly or secretly; and kill not anyone whom Allah has forbidden, except for a just cause (according to Islamic law). This He has commanded you that you may understand” [Al-An`am 6:151]\xa0\n“And ask (O Muhammad) those of Our Messengers whom We sent before you: Did We ever appoint alihah (gods) to be worshipped besides the Most Gracious (Allah)?” [Az-Zukhruf 43:45]\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 It should not be self-contradictory, so it should not issue one command that is contradicted by another, or forbid something then allow something very similar for no reason, or forbid something or allow it for some but not for others. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Do they not then consider the Quran carefully? Had it been from other than Allah, they would surely, have found therein many a contradiction” [An-Nisa’ 4:82]\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The religion should guarantee to protect people’s religious commitment, honour, wealth, lives and children through the commands, prohibitions and morals that it prescribes, which protect these five holistic principles.\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The true religion should be a mercy to mankind, freeing them from the wrongs that they do to themselves and to one another, whether those wrongs have to do with violating their rights, giving control of wealth to the few or leaders misleading the masses. Allah says, telling us of the mercy that was contained in the Tawrat which He sent down to Musa (peace be upon him):\xa0\n“And when the anger of Musa (Moses) was calmed down, he took up the Tablets; and in their inscription was guidance and mercy for those who fear their Lord” [Al-A`raf 7:154 – interpretation of the meaning]\nAllah says, telling us how He sent ‘Isa (peace be upon him): \xa0\n“And (We wish) to appoint him as a sign to mankind and a mercy from Us (Allah).” [Maryam 19:21 – interpretation of the meaning]\nAnd Allah says of Salih (peace be upon him):\xa0\n“He said: O my people! Tell me, if I have a clear proof from my Lord, and there has come to me a mercy (Prophethood) from Him.” [Hood 11:63 – interpretation of the meaning]\nAnd He says of the Quran:\xa0\n“And We send down of the Quran that which is a healing and a mercy to those who believe.” [Al-Isra’ 17:82 – interpretation of the meaning]\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 It should include guidance regarding the laws of Allah and should show people what Allah wants, and should tell them where they came from and where they are going. Allah says of the Tawrat:\xa0\n“Verily, We did send down the Tawrat (Torah) [to Musa (Moses)], therein was guidance and light.” [Al-Ma'idah 5:44 – interpretation of the meaning]\nHe says of the Injil:\xa0\n“and We gave him the Injil (Gospel), in which was guidance and light.” [Al-Ma’idah 5:46 – interpretation of the meaning]\nAnd He says of the Quran:\xa0\n“It is He Who has sent His Messenger (Muhammad) with guidance and the religion of truth (Islam).” [Al-Tawbah 9:33 – interpretation of the meaning].\nThe true religion is that which contains guidance concerning the laws of Allah and brings security and peace of mind , so that all whispers of the Shaytan are driven away and all questions are answered, and all confusing matters are cleared up.\xa0\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 It should advocate the best attitudes and actions, such as truthfulness, justice, trustworthiness, modesty, chastity and generosity. And it should forbid bad attitudes and actions, such as disobedience to parents, murder, immoral actions, lying, wrongdoing, oppression, miserliness and promiscuity.\xa0\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 It should bring happiness to those who believe. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Ta-Ha. We have not sent down the Quran unto you (O Muhammad) to cause you distress.” [Ta-Ha 20:1-2]\nIt should be in accordance with the sound natural disposition of man (Al-Fitrah):\xa0\n“Allah’s Fitrah (i.e. Allah’s Islamic Monotheism) with which He has created mankind.” [Al-Rum 30:30 – interpretation of the meaning]\nIt should also be in accordance with sound reason and common sense, because the true religion is the laws of Allah, and sound reason is the creation of Allah , and it is impossible that the law of Allah and the creation of Allah would contradict one another.\xa0\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 It should point towards the truth and warn against falsehood. It should show the way to true guidance and steer people away from misguidance. It should call people to the straight path in which there is no crookedness. Allah tells us that when the jinn heard the Quran, they said to one another:\xa0\n“O our people! Verily, we have heard a Book (this Quran) sent down after Musa (Moses), confirming what came before it, it guides to the truth and to the Straight Path (i.e. Islam)”\n[Al-Ahqaf 46:30 – interpretation of the meaning]\nIt does not call them to that which would cause them misery. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Ta-Ha. We have not sent down the Quran unto you (O Muhammad) to cause you distress” [Ta-Ha 20:1-2]\nAnd it does not enjoin them to do anything that would cause their doom. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And do not kill yourselves (nor kill one another). Surely, Allah is Most Merciful to you.” [An-Nisa’ 4:29]\nIt does not differentiate between its followers on the grounds of race, colour or tribe. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“O mankind! We have created you from a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another. Verily, the most honourable of you with Allah is that (believer) who has At-Taqwa [i.e. he is one of the pious]. Verily, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Aware.” [Al-Hujurat 49:13]\nThe only distinguishing feature for which people may be preferred over others, according to the true religion , is piety or fear of Allah.\xa0\nIn the light of the guidelines by which we may distinguish between the true religion and false religions, supported by that which is said in the Holy Quran, which indicates that these guidelines apply to all the truthful Messengers who were sent from Allah, we may then discuss different types of religions.\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9607/how-to-distinguish-between-true-religion-and-false-religion
