483142,"I can recite well from al-Baqarah to al-An‘am in approximately one and a half hours, and that is 8 juz’. In other words, I can complete the entire Quran by repeating this portion four times, that is, in only five hours. What is the ruling on that? What is the ruling on doing this in Ramadan instead of doing a complete khatm? Will I get the same reward?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly: We congratulate you on what you are doing of good by constantly reciting Quran, and you should carry on with that, because the religious texts speak of the great virtue of doing that.\nIt was narrated from ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ood (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever recites a letter of the Book of Allah will have one good deed recorded for him, and the good deed brings a tenfold reward. I do not say that alif-lam-mim is a letter; rather alif is a letter, lam is a letter and mim is a letter.” At-Tirmidhi (2910); classed as sahih by al-Albani.\nThis reward is attained by everyone who reads or recites any surah of the Quran, whether he recites it as part of a khatm in the correct order, or in his prayer, or in any kind of recitation, without paying attention to any particular khatm.\nBut repeating what you have memorized from al-Baqarah to al-An‘am is not regarded as a real khatm of the Quran, even though you will attain reward for reciting Quran. So strive to recite what you recite well from memory, then complete the rest by reading from the Mushaf.\nThe practice of the early generations (the salaf) was to complete the entire Quran, then go back to the beginning and start again, and so on.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is disliked (makruh) to take too long in completing the Quran and to take more than forty days to complete it.\nAhmad said: What I mostly heard is that the Quran should be completed within forty days.\nThat is because taking longer than that will lead to forgetting the Quran and becoming negligent about it. Therefore what we have mentioned is more appropriate.\nThis applies if there is no excuse. If there is an excuse, then the matter is flexible.\xa0 End quote from al-Mughni (2/611).\nSecondly: you should understand that the best of guidance is the guidance of Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). He has told us the timeframe for completing the Quran, and one should not go beyond that.\nIt was narrated from ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to him: “Read the Quran in a month.” I said: I can do more than that… Until he said: “Read it in seven days, and do not do more than that.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (4767).\nHe also forbade them to complete it in less than three days. It was narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The one who reads the Quran in less than three days will not understand it.” Narrated by Abu Dawud (1394); classed as sahih by al-Albani.\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: What is the longest timeframe for completing the Quran?\nHe replied: There is no set timeframe for that, and the best one can do in that regard is what the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) explained to ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘As when he asked him about how to read the Quran. ‘Abdullah told him that he completed the Quran every day and fasted all the time, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) told him to fast and not fast, and to sleep and pray qiyam, and to complete the Quran every month. He said: “Your own self has a right over you, your wife has a right over you, and your guest has a right over you, so give each of them his or her due.” ‘Abdullah asked for more, and in the end, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) told him to read it in a week, as he said: “Read it every week,” meaning every seven days.\nSo the best timeframe to complete the Quran is seven days, and if a person takes longer to do it, there is nothing wrong with that. So it may be completed in a month, or in twenty days, or more than that. The minimum time frame for completing it is three days, as it says in the hadith “The one who reads the Quran in less than three days will not understand it,” or however the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said it. End quote from the Shaykh’s website.\nWe have previously given a detailed answer regarding this matter; please see question no. 156299.\nThirdly:\nCompleting 8 juz’ in an hour and a half means that each juz’ is completed in 11 minutes, which is a very short time to recite an entire juz’ of the Quran. It is barely possible for a person to recite in a proper manner in this time, and to recite it as it should be recited, let alone understand what he is reciting and reflect on it.\nThe early generations disallowed reciting Quran quickly, if that will lead to mispronouncing the words or will not give any opportunity for reflection. It was narrated that Ibn Mas‘ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Do not recite the Quran rapidly as you recite poetry, and do not utter its words carelessly in the manner of handling poor quality dates. Rather, pause to reflect on its wonders and let your heart be moved by it. The main focus of one of you should not be merely to reach the end of the surah. Al-Bayhaqi: Shu‘ab al-Iman (1883).\nIt was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: There was a time in our lives when one of us would learn about faith before learning about the Quran, and a surah would be revealed to Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and he would learn what it permitted and what it prohibited, and where one should pause to reflect and understand, as you learn the Quran. Then he said: I have seen some men, one of whom starts to recite Quran, and he recites it from al-Fatihah to the end without realising what it enjoins and what it prohibits, or where he should pause and reflect, and the way in which he recites it is (careless) like one who is handling poor quality dates. Narrated by al-Hakim in al-Mustadrak (1/35); he said: It is a sahih hadith according to the conditions of al-Bukhari and Muslim, and I am not aware of any problem with the hadith. And adh-Dhahabi agreed with him.\nReciting the Quran with speed is described by the scholars as qira’at al-hadr.\nOne of the conditions of qira’at al-hadr is that it should not lead to mispronunciation. Qira’at al-hadr means reciting one word after another in rapid succession, whilst paying attention to grammar and the correct pronunciation, and pronouncing the letters clearly. See: al-Itqan fi ‘Ulum al-Quran (1/345).\nReciting a juz’ in ten minutes does not allow one to pronounce words correctly or pay attention to grammar; rather it is reciting at such speed that it is not possible to follow the meaning.\nWhat was narrated from ‘Uthman ibn ‘Affan (may Allah be pleased with him), that he recited the entire Quran in a rak‘ah, is not a precedent to be followed by others; rather it is something unique to ‘Uthman. We are not like him, and what he was enabled to do is something that we cannot be enabled to do. If it is said that this is a karamah (miracle or extraordinary feat) with which he was honoured, that would not be far-fetched, but most of the Sahabah used to recite the Quran in seven days.\nAl-Hafiz al-‘Iraqi said: The Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) used to complete the Quran every seven days… Among those who completed it every seven days were: Tamim ad-Dari, ‘Abd ar-Rahman ibn Yazid, Ibrahim an-Nakha‘i, ‘Urwah ibn az-Zubayr, Abu Mijlaz, Ahmad ibn Hanbal, and the wife of Ibn Mas‘ud. Masruq regarded that as something good. Among those who would complete it in eight days were Ubay and Abu Qilabah. Among those who would complete it in six days was al-Aswad ibn Yazid. Among those who would complete it in five days was ‘Ilqimah ibn Qays. Among those who would complete it in three days was Ibn Mas‘ud. And he said that the one who recites it in less than three days is reciting at speed.

7268,"DuringHajj, is it permissible to use an umbrella that covers the head and protects the body from the heat of the sun? This umbrella is however held by supports from the shoulder leaving the two hands free.","[""Praise be to Allah.Is it permissible for men to cover their head in Ihram?\nThe scholars agree that covering the head is prohibited for a man in Ihram . This is indicated by the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) concerning a man who died in `Arafah when he was in Ihram: “Wash him with water and lotus leaves, and shroud him in two cloths, and do not put any perfume on him or cover his head, for Allah will resurrect him on the Day of Resurrection reciting the Talbiyah.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 1267; Muslim, 1206)\nAl-Bukhari (1542) and Muslim (1177) narrated from `Abdullah ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that a man said, “O Messenger of Allah, what garments should the Muhrim (a person in the state of Ihram) wear?” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “He should not wear a shirt, or a turban, or pants, or a burnoose or Khifaf (leather socks).” The burnoose is a garment worn by the people of the Maghreb (North Africa) which has a hood attached.\xa0\nTypes of covering the head in Ihram\nThe Muhrim’s covering his head is of various kinds:\xa0\n\nCovering it with something that stays on the head , such as a hat or turban and the like. This is prohibited. The evidence for it being prohibited is the two Hadith quoted above.\xa0\nCovering his head with something that does not touch or stay above it, such as an umbrella, tent, car roof etc. There is nothing wrong with this, because Umm Husayn (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “I performed Hajj with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) during the Farewell Pilgrimage, and I saw him when he stoned Jamarat Al-`Aqabah and went away on his mount, accompanied by Bilal and Usamah. One of them was leading his mount and the other was holding his garment over the head of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), shading him from the sun. (Narrated by Muslim, 1298)\n\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“This indicates that it is permissible for the Muhrim to shade his head with a cloth or whatever. This is our view and the view of the majority of scholars.”\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “This is exactly like an umbrella.”\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “There is nothing wrong with the Muhrim using an umbrella to shield himself from the sun, or shading himself in a tent or under the roof of a car.” (Fatawa Ibn Baz, 17/115)\xa0\n\nCarrying one’s luggage on one's head. There is nothing wrong with this because it is usually not done with the intention of covering the head. If it is done with that intention then it is prohibited.\xa0\n\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Carrying luggage is not covering the head, it is like the Muhrim carrying food and the like, so long as he is not doing that as a trick (to get around the ruling), because Allah has forbidden His slaves to use trickery in order to do things that He has forbidden.” (Fatawa Ibn Baz, 17/115)\xa0\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 11356 , 175014 , 227097 , and 41140 .\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/7268/can-you-use-an-umbrella-in-ihram
498974,Does committing a minor sin with other people come under the heading of committing sin openly?,"['Praise be to Allah.It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “All of my ummah will be safe, except those who commit sin openly, and it is part of committing sin openly for a man to do something at night, then in the morning when his Lord has concealed him, he says: O So and so, I did such and such last night, when his Lord had concealed him all night, but in the morning he discloses that which Allah had concealed for him.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (6069) and Muslim (2990).\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nRegarding the words “All of my ummah will be safe [mu‘afa]”, the word ‘afiyah [translated here as “safe”] either means that Allah will pardon him, or that Allah will grant him safety and grant others safety from him.""(Fath al-Bari\xa0 10/486).\nThe one who commits sin openly is the one who makes no attempt to conceal his sin.\nIbn al-Athir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “All of my ummah will be safe, except those who commit sin openly” – this refers to those who sin openly, making no attempt to conceal it, and they disclose what Allah had concealed of it for them, so they speak openly of it.""(An-Nihayah fi Gharib al-Hadith\xa0 1/321).\nThis hadith is general in meaning and is not limited to openly committing acts that are regarded as major sins. It is to be understood in general terms, therefore it forbids openly committing minor sins just as it forbids openly committing major sins.\nAs openly committing sin may include speaking of it and telling others about it, it also includes committing sinful acts in front of other people.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“All of my ummah will be safe (mu‘afa)” means that Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has pardoned them.\n“except those who commit sin openly” – those who commit sin openly are those who openly disobey Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. They may be divided into two categories:\nThe first category refers to one who commits sin openly, so he does it in front of other people whilst they are looking on. Undoubtedly he is not safe, because he has brought trouble upon himself and has brought it upon other people too [because they may imitate him].\nAs for his bringing trouble upon himself, that is because he wronged himself when he disobeyed Allah and His Messenger, and everyone who disobeys Allah and His Messenger is wronging himself…\nAs for his bringing trouble upon others, that is because if people see him committing sin, that action will become insignificant in their minds, and they may do the same as him.\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon himself) said: “Whoever sets a bad precedent in Islam, upon him will be the burden of that sin and a burden like that of those who commit that sin until the Day of Resurrection.”\nThis is a type of committing sin openly which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not mention, because the matter is clear.\nBut he did mention something else, which may not be clear to some people, as he said: “It is part of committing sin openly for a man to commit an evil action at night, and Allah conceals it for him” – or he does that in his house, and Allah conceals it for him and does not let anyone know about it. If he were to repent from it privately, between him and his Lord, that would be better for him, but if he gets up in the morning and mixes with people, and says: I did such and such last night, and I did such and such, and I did such and such, then he will not be safe, for Allah concealed him, but in the morning he exposed his deeds… Therefore he is not one of those who will be safe, because he is one of those who commit sin openly.""(Sharh Riyadh as-Salihin, 3/16-17).\nIf a person commits sin with others, such as his companions and friends, then he may undoubtedly come under the heading of committing sin openly, if the doer does that deed openly, without caring and without accepting the concealment of Allah, even if the sin is something that could not happen except with other people, such as backbiting and spreading malicious gossip.\nThe Islamic principle is that matters are to be judged on the basis of the purpose and intention behind them.\nThat is because the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Deeds are but by intentions and each man will have but that which he intended.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (1) and Muslim (1907).\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: What matters is aims and purposes when one says and does anything, because if we say something, then say something else, changing the order of the words but the meaning remains the same, then both are subject to the same ruling. If the words are similar but the meanings are different, then they are subject to different rulings. The same applies to deeds. The one who reflects properly on Islamic teachings will undoubtedly understand that what is said above is sound.""(I‘lam al-Muwaqqi‘in\xa0 4/552).\nSo if the doer did not intend to display recklessness and carelessness by committing sin in front of people, and he did not intend to show audacity by sinning openly – rather it was a mistake that he made when he was among his friends, then what appears to be the case is that this does not come under the heading of committing sin openly because of which the doer will be deprived of safety and pardon, because he did not do that deliberately.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/498974/does-committing-sin-with-ones-friends-come-under-the-heading-of-committing-sin-openly
191792,"What is the ruling on saying “Labbayk ya Muhammad (Here I am at your service O Muhammad)” or “Labbayk ya Rasul Allah (Here I am at your service, O Messenger of Allah)”?","['Praise be to Allah.With regard to someone saying “Labbayk ya Rasul Allah” during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), there is no confusion about this being permissible. It is something that was well known among the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on many occasions.\xa0\nAl-Bukhari (128) and Muslim (32) narrated from Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was riding a mount with Mu`adh seated behind him, and he said: “O Mu`adh ibn Jabal.” Mu`adh said: “Labbayk ya Rasul Allah wa Sa`dayk (Here I am at your service, O Messenger of Allah).” He said: “O Mu`adh.” Mu`adh said: “Labbayk ya Rasul Allah wa Sa`dayk” – three times – he (the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no one who bears witness that none is worthy of worship but Allah, and that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger, but Allah will forbid him to the Fire.”\xa0\nIbn Al-Anbari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “What is meant by saying Labbayk is: I am persisting in obeying you. They used to use the related verb Labba to refer to staying in a place, and what is meant by Sa`dayk is following. Another scholar said: What is meant by Labbayk is responding time after time, and what is meant by Sa`dayk is following time after time. Al-Muhallab said: Responding by saying yes and any other word that gives the meaning of yes is sufficient, but responding to the call of a master by honouring him and saying Labbayka wa Sa`dayk is better.” (Sharh Sahih Al-Bukhari, 9/50)\xa0\nOnce it is known that calling in this manner or speaking in this manner is only appropriate in the case of one who is still alive, then such a call can only be made to one who is alive and is able to hear the one who is calling him, and such words can only be addressed to one who is alive and can hear the words that are said to him. Nothing can be requested except of one who is alive and can hear, and is able to respond to the request that is made of him.\xa0\nHowever, what appears to be the case with regard to those who say these words and make them a slogan, and call others to it, is that they want to exaggerate in showing extreme obedience to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and adherence to his path, and to annoy those who oppose him and hate him. These are good aims that are in accordance with Islamic teachings, but this wording may give the impression – to one who does not understand the real meaning intended – that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is like any other human who is alive, and that he can hear those who call upon him or talk to him; the one who does that may move on from that to calling upon him and seeking his help, because of the wrong impression that these words may give.\xa0\nTherefore it would have been more appropriate to avoid such a slogan and to replace it with other words concerning which there is no ambiguity, especially since the true way of showing obedience to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and showing support for him, which he loved and which truly annoyed his enemies and haters, can only be by constantly obeying him and adhering to his teachings, not merely uttering claims and words.\xa0\nShaykh Salih Al-Fawzan (may Allah preserve him) was asked:\xa0\nThere are some stickers in shops on which it is written “Labbayk ya Rasul Allah”. Is this phrase permissible? Is it shirk? What should we do about it?\xa0\nHe replied:\xa0\n“The word “Labbayk” is for Allah – “Labbayk Allahumma labbayk (Here I am at Your service, O Allah; here I am).” With regard to the phrase “Labbayk ya Rasul Allah”, if the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) were to call you (when he was still alive) and say, “O So and so,” you would say,\xa0 “Labbayk ya Rasul Allah”, as the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) used to say when he called them. They would say: “Labbayk ya Rasul Allah.” But after his death, no one should say, “Labbayk ya Rasul Allah.” Rather you should say: “Labbayk Allahumma labbayk.”\nFor more details, please refer to the following answers: 72242 , 604 , 14250 , and 258503 .\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/191792/can-we-say-labbayk-ya-rasul-allah
