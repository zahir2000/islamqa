508244,Is it permissible to say that the Muslims are acting in the stead of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and of the Companions in carrying the message of Islam and conveying it?,"['Praise be to Allah.Yes, it is correct to say this. The Muslims are acting in the Prophet’s stead in conveying the message of Islam, calling people to it and explaining the teachings of Islam and conveying them to people.\nThe most deserving of the Muslims to be described as acting in the Prophet’s stead are the scholars.\nThis was stated by some of the scholars, such as ash-Shatibi (may Allah have mercy on him), who said:\nThe mufti is acting in the Prophet’s stead in the Muslim community.\nThe evidence for that is found in several things:\n-1-\xa0The religious texts. In the hadith it says that the scholars are the heirs of the prophets. The prophets did not leave behind any dinars or dirhams (that is, wealth); rather they left behind knowledge. In as-Sahih it is narrated that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whilst I was sleeping, I saw a vessel that was brought to me, in which was milk. I drank from it until its moisture flowed from beneath my nails, then I gave my leftovers to ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab.” They said: How did you interpret that, O Messenger of Allah? He said: “Knowledge.”\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was sent as a warner, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “But you are only a warner” [Hud 11:12], and He says of the scholars (interpretation of the meaning): “For there should separate from every division of them a group [remaining] to obtain understanding in the religion and warn [i.e., advise] their people\xa0” [at-Tawbah 9:122].\n-2-\xa0The scholar is acting in the Prophet’s stead in conveying the rulings of Islam, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Let those of you who are present convey to those who are absent.” And he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Convey from me, even if it is one verse.” As that is the case, it means that he is acting in the Prophet’s stead.\n-3-\xa0The mufti is a lawgiver in one sense, because what he conveys of Islamic rulings is either transmitted from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) or it is derived from the religious texts that were narrated from him. In the former case, he is conveying it and in the latter case he is acting in his stead by initiating rulings, and initiating rulings is only for the lawgiver. If the mujtahid (mufti) initiates rulings based on what he thinks and works out, then in this sense he is a lawgiver and must be followed. This definitely means that the scholar is the successor of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and even in the case where he is only conveying the ruling that was given by the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), he still has to examine the matter and understand the wording of the text, and understand the reasons for the ruling and how the ruling is connected to its reason. In both cases, he is the one who must do that, so in this regard he is acting in the lawgiver’s stead in that sense. It says in the hadith: “Whoever reads the Qur’an, prophethood is placed in his heart.”\nIn conclusion, the mufti is telling people the rulings of Allah, as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did; and is approving or disapproving of the deeds of accountable people on the basis of his understanding, as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did; and his rulings are to be implemented by the Muslims, because he is the successor to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Hence the scholars are called those in authority, and obedience to them is mentioned alongside obedience to Allah and His Messenger in the verse (interpretation of the meaning): “obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you” [an-Nisa’ 4:59].\nThere is a great deal of evidence to support this concept.

478268,"Is speaking to a dead person haram or even shirk, I dont mean praying or seeking for help, I mean only to speak to a dead person and can you give proofs from Quran and Sunnah","['Praise be to Allah.What is prescribed when visiting graves is to greet the occupants with salaam and offer supplication for them, not to talk to them.\nMuslim (975) narrated that Buraydah said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to teach them, when they went out to the graves, to say: Peace be upon you, O people of these abodes, believers and Muslims, and we will, if Allah wills, join you soon. I ask Allah for wellbeing for us and for you.”\nAccording to a report narrated by an-Nasa’i, when the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came to the graveyard, he would say: “Peace be upon you, O people of these abodes, believers and Muslims. Indeed we, if Allah wills, will join you soon. You have gone ahead of us and we will join you. I ask Allah for wellbeing for us and for you.”\nRegardless of whether it is said that the dead can hear or not hear, talking to them as one talks to those who are living is not mentioned in the reports. Moreover, it is a door that leads to a number of bad things, such as becoming attached to them and addressing one’s worries and concerns to them, and perhaps that would lead to believing that they know the unseen, or it would lead to calling upon them and asking of them.\nIf speaking to the dead was a good thing, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his companions would have done that before us. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{This day I have perfected for you your religion and completed My favor upon you and have approved for you Islam as religion}\xa0[Al-Ma’idah 5:3].\nIbn al-Majishun said: I heard Malik say: Whoever introduces an innovation into Islam, thinking that it is good, is claiming that Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) betrayed the trust, because Allah says: {This day I have perfected for you your religion} [al-Ma’idah 5:3]. So whatever was not part of the religion on that day cannot be part of the religion today.""(Al-I‘tisam by ash-Shatibi 1/64).\nBased on that, the one who visits graves should adhere to what is mentioned in the religious texts, so he should greet the occupants with salaam and offer supplication for them, then leave.\nIf it so happens that someone does speak to the deceased, it cannot be said that it is shirk or that it is prohibited; rather it may be said that it is not prescribed and it may lead to that which is prohibited, so the best is to refrain from doing that.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/478268/is-it-prescribed-to-talk-to-the-dead-when-visiting-graves
