393766,"We are developing an e-commerce project consisting of an app and website. One of the features that we are currently working on adding to it is enabling the user of the app to invite someone else by sending an invite link with a code that is unique to the person who he wants to invite to the app. When the invited person uses the link, with the code, he will be able to subscribe to the app through this link. We want to give the person who sent the invitation a number of points, and through these points he will be able to obtain discounts on orders, based on the number of points. Is it permissible for us to do this? If, instead of points, we make the reward for this invitation a discount on a single order that the customer makes, and we state clearly the percentage of this discount, is that permissible? If all the ways mentioned above are prohibited, is there any other, Islamically-acceptable way in which we can reward this customer for inviting his friends? If we cancel the points and offer no reward for inviting others, is it permissible for us to do that?","['Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with the user of the app inviting his friends in return for commission, points or a discount, subject to two conditions:\nThe first condition:\nThat subscription to the app should be free. If subscription is in return for payment, then that is gambling, because he definitely loses the money that he pays in the hope of gaining more than that by inviting his friends, which is a gain that is merely possible. Gambling is certain loss for possible gain.\nAl-Bujayrimi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Gambling refers to when an action may lead to gain or loss. ""(Hashiyat al-Bujayrimi ‘ala Sharh al-Minhaj\xa0\xa04/376).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: In the case of gambling – which is any transaction which may lead to loss or gain – the one who engages in that transaction does not know whether he will be a winner or a loser. All of that is haram and is in fact a major sin. It is no secret that it is reprehensible, when we realise that Allah, may He be exalted, has mentioned it alongside Idol worship, alcohol and divining arrows.""(Fatawa Islamiyyah\xa0 4/441).\nThe second condition:\nThe commission should be known, because this comes under the heading of paying a fee for someone to do a certain job, the condition of which is that the fee should be known.\nIn al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (15/216) it says: Fees and stipulated conditions thereon:\nThe amount of the fee should be known:\nThe Malikis, Shafa‘is and Hanbalis said: In order for the hiring contract to be valid, it is stipulated that the fee should be a known amount of wealth, in terms of type and amount, because not knowing what you will receive undermines the purpose of the hiring contract, for hardly anyone would want to work when he does not know what fee he will receive. This is in addition to the fact that there is no reason for not mentioning it in the contract.\nFinding out about what payment will be received may be done by seeing it or having a description of it. End quote.\nIn al-Ma‘ayir ash-Shar‘iyyah (p. 261), it says: It is stipulated that the payment should be known, it should be something that has value according to Islamic teachings, and it should be something that can be handed over. If the payment is unknown, or it is not permissible according to Islamic teachings, or it is not possible to hand it over, then the payment should be worked out according to the going rate for similar work. End quote.\nHence it is not valid to make the payment in the form of points which will lead to an unknown gift or an unknown discount. Rather it must be explained to the participant that the points are equal to such and such cash value, or that the discount will be of such and such an amount.\nIf you cancel the points, and inviting others will be done for free, as mentioned at the end of your question, this is also permissible, on condition that it is made clear, and that everyone who invites someone else knows that he is doing that voluntarily, and that there is no benefit for him in doing that.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/393766/ruling-on-inviting-friends-to-a-e-commerce-app-in-return-for-points-or-discounts
114798,"My father used to work for an insurance company. When he started working for this company, he was not aware that working for insurance companies is prohibited, but he found out that working for them is prohibited when he reached the age of fifty. But despite that, he did not leave this job. Now my father is sixty-seven years old. He reached the age of retirement seven years ago, but despite that he is still working, without a salary but on commission. He intends to leave this job at the end of this year. I have advised him many times, but he says to me: I will leave this job soon. I want to explain to you that my father dealt with the money that he earned from his company in the following manner: in the beginning, he deposited it in interest-bearing account, then after that he took it and invested it in a construction project (a halal project). After explaining this, I hope that you could kindly answer the following questions: Is this money halal or haram, or is it mixed wealth? – Is it permissible for me and my siblings and my mother to make use of this wealth, even though I am working and receive a modest salary which, praise be to Allah, enables me to support myself? – My father spends on us and he intends, by Allah’s leave, to give me and each of my siblings an apartment to live in and some of his money; can I accept the apartment and the money, or should I refuse?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe commercial insurance contracts that are well known and widespread throughout the world are undoubtedly haram, and contrary to Islamic teachings, because they are contracts that are based on ambiguity and gambling, and some types are imposed on people by force of law and they enter into them unwillingly. These types of contracts combine many evils, so it is no wonder that the scholars unanimously state that they are prohibited, and any dissenting view is to be deemed odd and carries no weight.\nSecondly:\nWith regard to your father’s job and earnings from working for the insurance company, we remind him first of all to fear Allah, may He be exalted, because he is approaching the age of seventy, and he is still working in a job which he knows is haram and that it is not permissible for him to remain in it. When will he fear his Lord and give up deeds that incur Allah’s wrath? Can he guarantee that he will live until the end of the year, so as to justify his persisting in this haram type of work? How can he be content with himself, having reached this age, knowing that his life could end whilst he is persisting in disobeying his Lord, may He be exalted? A man such as him should be in his neighbourhood mosque, praying, reading Qur’an and offering supplication; he should be in the Haram, doing ‘umrah and observing i‘tikaf, focusing on worshipping Allah. He should not be working in companies that are based on gambling, and his main concern should not be how to attract and retain customers. We ask Allah, may He be exalted, to guide him soon and to enable him to spend what remains of his life doing the best of what his Lord loves.\nWith regard to the money that he earned from doing this unlawful work: whatever he earned before he realised that his work is haram is permissible for him, both the salary received during that period and any bonuses. Whatever he earned after he realised that it is haram is haram for him, both the salary received during that period and any bonuses.\nThe scholars of the Permanent Committee for Ifta’ said in one of their answers:\nRegarding the period that you spent working in the bank, we hope that Allah will forgive you the sin thereof, and with regard to whatever cash you accumulated and received as a result of working in the bank in the past, there is no sin on you for that, if you were unaware of the ruling thereon.\nShaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baz, Shaykh ‘Abd ar-Razzaq ‘Afifi, Shaykh ‘Abdullah ibn Ghadyan, Shaykh ‘Abdullah ibn Qa‘ud.\nFatawa al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah (15/46).\nThis fatwa applies to anyone who works in a haram field and is unaware of the ruling thereon, or who was told by someone whom he trusted that it is permissible. But that solution is subject to a condition that your father did not fulfil, which is giving up the job and not persisting in it. Allah, may He be exalted, has made giving up the haram activity a condition for previous earnings to be permissible.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{So whoever has received an admonition from his Lord and desists may have what is past}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:275].\nShaykh al-‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nOne of the things we learned from this verse is that whatever a person received of riba before coming to know that it is prohibited is permissible for him, on condition that he repents and desists.\'(Tafsir Surat al-Baqarah\xa0 3/377).\nSomething similar was stated by the scholars of the Permanent Committee. See their fatwa in the answer to question no. 106610 .\nHowever, after he came to know of the prohibition, his earnings are not permissible for him, because the work itself is haram.\nThirdly:\nWith regard to his wife and children who are sponsored by the one who earned haram wealth through haram work, there is no blame on them for what he spends on them. Rather the sin and prohibition apply to the one who acquired that wealth, and no one else. From this we may learn the reason why the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) accepted invitations from the Jews and ate their food, despite the fact that they acquired wealth through unlawful means.\nShaykh Muhammad ibn Salih al-‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\nMy father – may Allah forgive him – works in a riba-based bank. What is the ruling on us accepting his money and eating and drinking what is bought with his money? But we have another income, from my older sister who is working. Should we not accept maintenance from my father and accept maintenance from my older sister, even though we are a large family, or is my sister not obliged to spend on us, so we should accept maintenance from my father?\nHe replied:\nI say: accept what your father spends on you; you can enjoy it, and the consequences of earning it are to be borne by him, because you are receiving the money from your father lawfully, as he has wealth and you do not have wealth. Thus you are receiving it lawfully, and it is your father who is incurring the trouble of acquiring it and the sin of doing so, and he will bear the consequences, so that does not concern you. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) accepted gifts from the Jews, ate the food of the Jews, and bought from the Jews, even though the Jews are known for dealing in riba and consuming unlawful wealth. But the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) ate in a permissible manner, because if the food is acquired in a permissible manner, there is nothing wrong with it.\nFor example, look at the story of Barirah, the freed slave woman of ‘A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with them both): some meat was given in charity to her, then the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) entered his house one day and found the pot on the fire, so he called for food, but he was not given any meat; he was given some food in which there was no meat, so he said: “Did I not see the pot on the fire?” They said: Yes indeed, O Messenger of Allah, but it was meat that was given in charity to Barirah – and the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not eat any food that was given in charity. He said: “It is charity for her and a gift to us,” and he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) ate, even though it was prohibited for him to eat that which was given in charity, because he did not receive it as charity; rather he received it as a gift.\nSo to these brothers we say: Eat from your father’s wealth and enjoy it, and the sin and consequences thereof are to be borne by your father, unless Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, guides him and he repents, for whoever repents, Allah will turn to him in mercy.""(Al-Liqa’ ash-Shahri\xa0 45/question no. 16).\nThe ruling on this mixed wealth is that whatever you are given of it, you may consume and enjoy it, whether it is cash or otherwise, such as an apartment or land.\nWhatever he leaves behind after he dies, you should look and see if there is anyone who is the rightful owner of wealth that your father leaves behind, from whom it was taken unlawfully, then you must give it back to him. If it has no owner, or you cannot find the owner, then spend that amount on charitable causes. This applies to wealth that is haram in and of itself. As for that which is haram because of the way in which it was earned, it is haram for him but not for you. It is permissible for you, as noted above in the words of Shaykh al-‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him), unless you want to be extra cautious, in which case you may spend it on charitable causes, but this is not a must.\nShaykh al-Islam (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about one who dealt in riba and died, leaving behind wealth and a son, who was aware of his father’s situation. Is it permissible for the son to inherit or not?\n[He replied:] As for the amount that the son knows was earned through riba, he must dispose of it, either by returning it to its rightful owners, if possible, or by giving it in charity. The remainder of the wealth is not haram for him.\nBut with regard to the amount concerning which there is some doubt, it is recommended to refrain from taking it, if he does not need it to pay off a debt or spend on his dependents. But if the father acquired it through riba-based transactions for which some of the jurists granted concessions, it is permissible for the heir to make use of it. If the halal portion of the wealth is mixed with that which is haram, and the proportion of each is not known, then he should divide it into two halves.""(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa\xa0 29/307).\nThe scholars of the Permanent Committee said:\nIt is not permissible for the father to spend on his children’s maintenance wealth that was acquired in unlawful ways. This is well known to the questioner. As for the children, there is no sin on them for that; rather the sin is borne by their father.\nIf the entire house was acquired through theft, then what the heirs must do is return what was stolen to its owners, if they are known. If they are not known, then that must be spent on charitable causes, for building and renovating mosques, and it should be given in charity to the poor, with the intention that it is on behalf of the owner of the stolen wealth. This is also the ruling if part of the house was built with stolen wealth and part of it was built with the grandfather’s wealth. The heirs should return the equivalent of what was stolen to its owners, if they are known, otherwise they must spend that wealth on charitable causes, as noted above.\nShaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baz, Shaykh ‘Abd ar-Razzaq ‘Afifi, Shaykh ‘Abdullah ibn Ghadyan, Shaykh ‘Abdullah ibn Qa‘ud.\nFatawa al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah (26/332).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/114798/rulings-on-wealth-that-is-haram-because-of-the-way-in-which-it-is-acquired-and-is-haram-in-and-of-itself-and-on-children-benefitting-from-it-and-inheriting-it
