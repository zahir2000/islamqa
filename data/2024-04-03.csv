406878,"Referring to Fatwa number: (222445 ), I gave a sum of money as expiation for delaying the fasting to one of my relatives, and it was a sum of money equivalent to the value of providing rice; since it was difficult for me to bring him rice due to special circumstances, so as not to cause him embarrassment among his brothers and children, with my recommendation to him that he should buy rice with this amount. My question is: Is what I did permissible or not?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nWhoever breaks their fast in Ramadan due to a valid reason, such as menstruation or an illness that is expected to be cured, must make up for the days they missed before the next Ramadan enters.\nIf they delay making up the fasts until the next Ramadan arrives, many Jurists hold the view that in addition to making up the fasts, they must also feed a poor person for each day missed. Others opine that feeding the poor is recommended, not mandatory, and that the obligatory act is only to make up the fasts. Please refer to question no: (26865 ).\nSecondly:\nIt is permissible for one who wishes to feed a poor person to give them money and authorize them to buy food with it, and once the food is purchased, to take possession of it.\nThe Jurists have mentioned the reverse of this scenario and have ruled its permissibility, which is that the poor person authorizes the wealthy to take possession of the Zakat money on their behalf, and by doing so, the Zakat reaches the poor person and remains with the wealthy as a trust.\nThe scholar Ibn Qasim (may Allah have mercy on him) said in ""Hashiyat Ar-Rawd"" (3/293): ""If the poor person authorizes the owner of the wealth to take possession on their behalf, and to buy with it thereafter a garment or the like, it is valid.""

441733,Why are there paintings of some Muslim scholars despite it being haram?,"['Praise be to Allah.(1) We have previously explained in the answer to question number (344172) the ruling on photography and the making of statues, the prohibition by the majority and the permission by some Jurists for a limited type of them, and the most correct view in this matter, so please refer to it.\n(2) It is a well-established fact among specialists that Islamic civilization is more a civilization of the word than a civilization of the image; for this reason, most aspects of Islamic art are related to architecture, calligraphy, and ornamentation, and very little of it has taken the direction of painting and sculpture. Some historians have even stated that the Byzantine Church\'s prohibition of images and statues was influenced by Islam.\nDr. `Abdul Mun`im Majid says in his book ""The Political History of the Arab State - The Era of the Umayyad Caliphs"" (p. 34): ""The doctrine of the Byzantine state itself will be influenced by the call of Islam to prohibit the worship of images.""\n(3) The foregoing does not prevent the existence of drawing and sculpted images, but this was minimal compared to the other manifestations of artistic civilization previously mentioned. This small amount goes back to the environment of palaces and rulers and kings in the Umayyad state, increased slightly in the Abbasid state, and then most of it spread during the Fatimid era and those influenced by them from the Mamluks. This is not surprising for the Fatimids, who deviated from the Shari`ah in the fundamentals of belief, and spread various types of superstitions and polytheistic idolatries, which suited them to spread imagery and statues and other matters prohibited by the Shari`ah to block the means to polytheism and the glorification of the dead.\nDr. Salamah Muhammad `Ali says in his research ""Carving Living Elements in Islamic Art"": ""The Arab spirit was averse to those Western forms and styles that were imported in the form of statues and images printed on fabrics and curtains, which were done by traders coming from the Levant and Yemen, and those countries were polytheistic with multiple gods...\nAnd the Dislike of representing living creatures in Islamic art was a desire to distance from polytheistic manifestations.""\n(4) It is clear from the above that the legal and moral reality of Islam was the prohibition of statues and images, and that deviation from this reality occurred in the environment of rulers where types of deviation from the laws of Islam occurred, even exceeding the issue of images and statues.\nArtists who engaged in photography and sculpture were sponsored by the state, and as far as we know, it has not been proven that any of the scholars of Shari`ah, Jurisprudence, and Tafsir worked in the industry of images and statues, as understood from the formulation of the question. If it did occur, it might have been from those who permitted this matter, not as a practice that one of the majority of scholars who prohibited it engaged in.\nThe occurrence of shar`i violations by some rulers or in some social circles is understandable, as humans are not infallible from sins and mistakes. Muslims obey and disobey, but Islam itself, in its theories, rulings, and values, forbids these violations, and none of the Muslim scholars have systematically and methodically involved themselves in them; otherwise, where is this jurisprudential heritage that establishes these practices or acknowledges them?!\nIf someone has portrayed a scholar from the Muslim scholars, then the one who did it bears the responsibility, whether in the past or present, and there is no sin on the scholar for that, nor does it necessarily mean that he approves of it.\n\xa0And Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/441733/presence-of-paintaings-of-some-muslim-scholars
294681,"This year, I led the worshippers in the Tarawih prayers, and as the last days of the blessed month approached, one of the brothers came to me and placed 200 dinars in my hand. I thought to myself: If it comes without coveting it, then take it. What is the ruling on taking this money and spending it? I know that you say there is no harm in taking a fee for leading the prayers, but what I want to know is: Does taking this money decrease the reward for leading the Tarawih prayers? The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said, ""Nothing of this world that a servant receives will decrease his rank with Allah, even if it is something valuable."" Does this Hadith apply to this case or not? And do you advise me to take this money and spend it, or should I give it in charity?","['Praise be to Allah.The ruling on an Imam receiving money for leading Tarawih prayers\nThere is no harm in the Imam accepting what is given to him, provided he does not fear obligation from the giver, and it does not decrease his reward.\nIbn Qudamah said in ""Al-Mughni"" (2/9): ""It has been narrated from him [i.e., Ahmad] that he said: \'Do not pray behind someone who does not pay Zakat, and he said: Do not pray behind someone who stipulates conditions, but there is no harm if they give to him without stipulation."" End quote.\nAl-Buhuti said in ""Kashshaf Al-Qina`"" (1/475): ""(If something is given to him) i.e., the Imam (without stipulation, then there is no harm, explicitly [i.e., Imam Ahmad stated this]). And likewise, if he is given from the public treasury or from a Waqf (endowment)."" End quote.\nThis is despite the fact that the Hanbalis prohibit taking a fee for leading prayers, but they do not consider a gift without stipulation as a fee.\nSheikh `Abdul `Aziz Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: ""What is the ruling on an Imam setting a fee for his prayers with the people, especially if he goes to distant areas to lead them in Tarawih?""\nHe replied: ""Setting a specific amount should not be done, and a group of the Salaf disliked it, so if they help (gift) him with something unspecified, there is no harm in that.\nAs for the prayer, it is valid, and there is no problem with it - In sha Allah - even if they set a specific amount to help him; because the need may call for that.\nHowever, it is preferable not to do that, and that the assistance be without stipulation, this is better and safer as stated by a group of the Salaf (may Allah have mercy on them).""

It is established from him, and it is not authentic from the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) as his saying. Al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) said in ""Sahih At-Targhib wat-Tarhib"": ""It was narrated by Ibn Abi Ad-Dunya, and its chain is good, and it was narrated from \'Aishah marfu`an (attributed to the Prophet), and the Mawquf (stopped at the Companion) is more authentic.""

Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) explicitly stated this, saying: By Allah, no one acquires anything from this world except that it decreases his degrees with Allah, even if it was given to him generously.\nThe fortunate one is he who is content with sufficiency, for time is too noble to be wasted in pursuit of worldly gains, except for one who is pious in his earning, self-sufficient from greed, aiming to help the people of goodness, and giving charity to the needy, for the earning of such a person is better than his idleness.\nAs for the ascent that is caused by associating with rulers, it is unlikely that one\'s religion will remain safe with it, and even if it appears safe outwardly, the outcome is dangerous."" End quote from ""Sayd Al-Khatir"" (298).\nTaking a fee for acts of obedience that benefit others, such as teaching knowledge and the Quran, does not prevent the attainment of reward, and perhaps it does not decrease his reward, if his intention is good, his purpose is sincere, and he only takes it to be able to devote himself to benefiting and teaching. And his aim from this work is not merely worldly gain and accumulating wealth.\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: ""The essence of this matter is that it is recommended to take in order to perform Hajj, not to perform Hajj in order to take.\nThis applies to all provisions taken for a righteous deed; so whoever seeks provision to learn, to teach, or to strive in Jihad, then it is good. As it was reported from the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) that he said: The example of those who go out to fight from my Ummah and take their wages is like Umm Musa: she breastfeeds her son and takes her wage; he likened them to those who perform the act out of desire for it, like Umm Musa\'s desire to breastfeed; unlike a wet nurse who is hired for breastfeeding if she is a stranger.\nAs for those who engage in the appearance of a righteous deed in order to be provided for, this is from the actions of the world.\nThere is a difference between one whose goal is the religion, and the world is a means, and one whose goal is the world, and the religion is a means.

443049,"Does خَرَجَ in this hadith exclusively mean walking to the masjid or even driving is acceptable? Likewise, مِنْ بَيْتِهِ, does it only have to be from the house? what about from work? Different prophetic narrations state the great reward of walking to the mosque on foot. in addition to getting rewarded for attending congregational prayers, one could also get rewarded when he drives to the mosque.
