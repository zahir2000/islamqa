504356,"If I put water and soap in the washing machine, then I put dirty (impure) clothes in it and wash them once, and a trace of the colour of blood still remains, do all the clothes become impure and does the washing machine become impure, and does the hand become impure that touched the clothes when they were wet? If we put other clothes in the washing machine, do they also become impure? If that is the case, then almost all the clothes and household items have become impure, so what should I do?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nWe have previously discussed the impurity (najasah) of blood in the answer to question no. 114018 .\nSecondly:\nIt seems that what is meant by your saying “a trace of the colour of blood still remains” is that there is a slight trace of the colour of blood remaining on the garment after washing it. This trace may be overlooked.\nIt was narrated by Imam Ahmad in al-Musnad (14/371-372) and by Abu Dawud (365) from Abu Hurayrah that Khawlah bint Yasar came to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and said: O Messenger of Allah, I only have one garment, and I wear it when I am menstruating; what should I do?\nHe said: “When you become pure, wash it then pray in it.”\nShe said: What if the (traces of) blood have not disappeared?\nHe said: “Water is sufficient for you and the traces will do any harm.”\nIt was classed as hasan by the commentators on al-Musnad, and classed as sahih by al-Albani in Irwa’ al-Ghaleel (1/189).\nAd-Darimi (1052) narrated from ‘A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that a woman said to her: There may be blood on the garment, so I wash it, but it does not disappear; should I cut it out? She said: Water is a means of purification.\nFor more information, please see the answers to questions no. 438695 and 163825 .\nBased on that, this garment may be deemed to be pure (tahir), and the impurity does not make the washing machine or the clothes in it impure.\nIf you were uncertain because of persistent intrusive thoughts (waswasah), we advise you not to get carried away with them; rather you should put a stop to them and ignore them, for when they take hold, they will cause you too much trouble.\n\xa0And Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/504356/if-the-traces-of-blood-remain-after-washing-a-garment-in-the-washing-machine-do-the-other-garments-also-become-impure-najis
49897,"We are going to go for `Umrah at the end of Sha`ban and the beginning of Ramadan, in sha Allah.","['Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with repeating `Umrah . The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) encouraged us to do `Umrah and he did not define the time period that should elapse between two `Umrahs.\xa0\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Mughni:\xa0\n“There is nothing wrong with doing `Umrah several times in the year . That was narrated from `Ali, Ibn `Umar, Ibn `Abbas, Anas, `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with them), and `Ata’, Tawus, `Ikrimah and Ash-Shafi`i (may Allah have mercy on them), because `Aishah did `Umrah twice in one month on the command of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “From one `Umrah to another is expiation for whatever (sins) come between them.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim) \xa0\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked in Majmu` Al-Fatawa (17/432): Is it permissible to perform `Umrah repeatedly in Ramadan, seeking the reward for that?\n\xa0He replied:\xa0\n“There is nothing wrong with that. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “From one `Umrah to another is expiation for whatever (sins) come between them, and an accepted Hajj brings no less a reward than Paradise.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 1773 and Muslim, 1349)\xa0\nIf a person does `Umrah three or four times, there is nothing wrong with that. At the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), at the Farewell Pilgrimage, `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) did `Umrah twice within a space of less than twenty days.\xa0\nAnd the Standing Committee was asked (11/337):\xa0\nI live in a town 100 kilometers away from Makkah. In Ramadan every year I go to Makkah for `Umrah, and I pray Jumu`ah and `Asr there, then I go back to my town. I discussed that with some of my brothers and they said that it is not permissible to do `Umrah every week in Ramadan.\xa0\nThey replied:\xa0\n“If the situation is as you describe, that is permissible, because there is no text that specifies the length of time that should elapse between one `Umrah and the next.\xa0\nSome scholars are of the view that time should be allowed between two `Umrahs for hair to grow that the pilgrim can shave in the second `Umrah. This time period is approximately one week or ten days.\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti` (7/242):\xa0\n“Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) said: he should not do `Umrah until his head has turned black with hair.\xa0\nBased on this, what many people do nowadays of performing `Umrah repeatedly, especially in the month of Ramadan every day, or once each day and once each night, is contrary to what the Salaf used to do.\xa0\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Mughni:\xa0\n“`Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) said (`Umrah may be done) once each month. When his hair had grown back, Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) would go out and do `Umrah again. Both reports were narrated by Ash-Shafi`i (may Allah have mercy on him) in his Musnad. `Ikrimah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: He should do `Umrah when his hair can be shaved by the razor. `Ata’ said: If he wishes he can do `Umrah twice each month. Ahmad said: If he does `Umrah, then he has to shave his head or cut his hair. In ten days he can shave his head.”\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 26/45:\xa0\n“What Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) stated is that it is not recommended to repeat `Umrah often from Makkah or elsewhere , rather one should allow time in between for the hair to grow back so that it can be shaved.”\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/49897/can-you-do-umrah-twice-in-one-journey
464257,"I work via the Internet, and I keep my profits in dollars in my Pioneer online banking account. This online bank allows me to transfer cash in dollars from it to other, real bank accounts. My question is: is it permissible for me to sell dollars to my brother by transferring them from my online banking account to his account in a real bank, then he gives me the value in local currency? The problem that makes me ask whether this transaction is permissible is the fact that the amount that I am going to transfer to him will not enter his account immediately; it may take two days or even as long as ten days. Is it permissible if I wait and do not collect the equivalent of the dollars in local currency until the day when the money reaches my brother’s account? Or is it permissible for us to work out the value of the dollars at the exchange rate on the day on which I transferred the money from my account in the online bank to my brother’s account in the real bank, by sending him a copy of the transfer to prove that the transfer had been done? Please note that this is a matter of mutual consent between us, and I am not really bothered by fluctuations in the exchange rate. Rather my concern is whether this transaction is permissible or not according to Islam, and whether there is anything in it that is contrary to Islamic teachings.","['Praise be to Allah.Your selling the dollars in your account to your brother in return for local currency is called an exchange, and the condition of it being permissible is that the exchange should take place immediately.\nThe exchange can be either real, meaning that the money is exchanged hand-to-hand, or it may be virtual, meaning that the money goes into the account of each of you.\nThe basis for stipulating that the exchange take place immediately is the report narrated by Muslim (1587) from ‘Ubadah ibn as-Samit (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “: “Gold for gold, silver for silver, wheat for wheat, barley for barley, dates for dates, salt for salt, like for like, same for same, hand to hand. But if these commodities differ, then sell as you like, as long as it is hand to hand [that is, exchanged immediately].”\nPaper currencies come under the same rulings as gold and silver.\nIt said in a statement of the Islamic Fiqh Council belonging to the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC):\nWith regard to the rulings on paper currencies, they are legal tender by which prices are measured, and they come under the established Islamic rulings on gold and silver with regard to matters such as riba (usury), zakah, payment in advance (salam transaction) and so on.\nEnd quote from Majallat al-Majma‘ (issue no. 3, vol. 3, p. 1650; issue no. 5, vol. 3, p. 1609).\nBased on that, it is not permissible for you to take local currency from your brother when there is a delay in the dollars being deposited in his account.\nBut it is permissible for you to send the dollars to him to keep as a trust for you, then once the dollars have been deposited in his account, it is permissible to do this exchange, whereby he will take possession of the dollars and you will take local currency from him at the rate of exchange on that day.\nIt says in Kashshaf al-Qina‘ (3/269): If he gives him five dirhams for half a dinar, then he gives him a dinar for him to take half of it, the exchange is valid because it takes place immediately, even if he does not give him back half a dinar before they part.\nSo the half dinar is his, and the other half is like a trust in the hand of the recipient, because of what was noted above.\nAnd they may separate before he gives him back the other half of the dinar.\nThen if he wants to exchange the other half for what is left of the dinar with him, that is permissible.\nOr if he buys something from him with the remaining half dinar, that is permissible.\nOr if he wants to make the remaining half-dinar payment in advance for something, that is permissible, because it is his money and is not a loan that he gave to the other man.\nOr if he wants to give it as a gift to the other man, so he lets him keep the remaining half dinar, that is permissible, because he is the owner of the wealth and is disposing of it in an appropriate manner. End quote.\nThis indicates that it is permissible to leave wealth with someone else as a trust, then exchange it for a different currency.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/464257/is-it-permissible-to-transfer-dollars-to-the-account-of-someone-else-then-receive-from-him-the-equivalent-in-local-currency-even-though-the-transfer-takes-time-to-reach-his-account
