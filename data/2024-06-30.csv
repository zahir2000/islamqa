493375,"If two people agree on the sale and purchase of a house and on a time for payment, then the purchaser delays payment, so he makes an agreement with the seller that he will pay off the value in gold, is that valid? What is the ruling on penalty clauses in a contract for the sale and purchase of land?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIf the purchaser delays payment of the price, and makes an agreement with the seller that he will pay off the amount in gold, that may be done in one of two ways:\n-1-\xa0The first way is paying the balance in gold immediately. There is nothing wrong with that if it is based on the price of gold on the day that the payment is to be made, or less than that. This is regarded as an exchange between gold and what the man owes in Egyptian pounds, and making an exchange for what one owes is like immediately paying for what you have purchased.\nThe basic principle regarding that is the report narrated by Ahmad (6239), Abu Dawud (3354), an-Nasa’i (4582), at-Tirmidhi (1242) and Ibn Majah (2262) from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: I used to sell camels for dinars [i.e to be paid at a later date] and accept dirhams, and I would sell them for dirhams and accept dinars. I asked the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) about that and he said: “There is nothing wrong with you accepting payment based on the current price, so long as you do not part when there is something still outstanding between you.” \xa0\nThe hadith was classed as sahih by some of the scholars, such as an-Nawawi and Ahmad Shakir. Others classed it as sahih on the basis that it is the words of Ibn ‘Umar, not the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), including al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar and al-Albani. See: Irwa’ al-Ghalil (5/173).\nIt is only prohibited to charge more than the current price of gold, so that the seller will not make a profit on something that he was never liable for.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is permissible to exchange one of the two currencies (gold and silver) for the other, in the case of purchasing or paying what one owes, according to most of the scholars.\nEnd quote from al-Mughni (4/37); he quoted as evidence the hadith of Ibn ‘Umar.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: What he must do is pay back what you loaned him in dollars, because this is the nature of the loan that you gave him.\nBut despite that, if you both agreed that he would give you Egyptian pounds, there is nothing wrong with that. Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I used to sell camels in al-Baqi‘ – or an-Naqi‘ – for dirhams, but we would accept the payment in dinars; and we would sell for dinars but accept the payment in dirhams. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There is nothing wrong with you accepting payment based on the current price, so long as you do not part when there is something still outstanding between you.” This is selling currency for currency of a different kind, so it is more akin to selling gold for silver.\nSo if you and he have agreed that he will give you Egyptian pounds instead of dollars, on condition that you do not take more in pounds than the equivalent at the time of the exchange, there is nothing wrong with that.\nFor example, if 2000 dollars is equivalent to 2800 pounds, it is not permissible for you to take 3000 pounds from him, but it is permissible for you to take 2800 pounds. And it is permissible for you to take only 2000 dollars from him, meaning that you take the current price or less, and do not take more, because if you take more, then you will have made a profit on something for which you were never liable, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade making a profit on something for which you were never liable. But if you take less, this is like taking some of what is due to you and letting him off regarding the rest, and there is nothing wrong with that.""(Fatawa Islamiyyah (2/414).\n-2-\xa0The second way is where he does not give him gold at present; rather they both agree on gold to be given later on, based on the price of gold on the day of the missed payment or at the current price on the day the agreement was made. This is haram, because it is a delayed exchange, as you are exchanging what you are owed of pounds for gold to be delivered later on. This is riba (usury), because it is stipulated that when exchanging currency for gold, or vice versa, the exchange must be done immediately, on the spot, because of the report narrated by Muslim (1588) from Abu Hurayrah, that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Dinar for dinar with no difference between them and dirham for dirham with no difference between them.”\nAnd it was narrated that ‘Ubadah ibn as-Samit (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Gold for gold, silver for silver, wheat for wheat, barley for barley, dates for dates, salt for salt, like for like, same for same, hand to hand. But if these commodities differ, then sell as you like, as long as it is hand to hand.” Narrated by Muslim (1587).\nCurrencies come under the same rulings as gold and silver, so any exchange must be hand to hand.\nBased on that, the buyer still owes pounds, and it is not permissible to make an agreement that he owes gold of whatever price.\nThe solution in this case, so that the seller’s rights will not be affected, is for him to cancel the deal, take back the house and give back the instalments that the purchaser had paid to him.\nThe scholars have stated that it is permissible for the seller to cancel the deal if the purchaser is in financial difficulty or is taking too long to pay.\nIt says in al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (32/136): Ibn Taymiyah said that if the purchaser is in financial difficulty or is taking too long to pay, the seller may cancel the deal so as to ward off the harm to which dispute may lead. He said in al-Insaf: This is the correct view. End quote.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said: If the seller knows that the purchaser is in financial difficulty, then he has no choice. For example, if a man sells an item to someone thinking that he is rich, then he finds out that he is in financial difficulty, he has the right to cancel the deal, because allowing more time to pay could be detrimental to his own interests.\nBut if he sold this item to someone already knowing that he was in financial difficulty, he has no option to cancel, because he entered into the transaction fully aware [of the purchaser’s situation].""(Ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘\xa0 8/364).\nHe also said: If it turns out that the purchaser is the kind to take too long to pay, then the seller may cancel the deal, because some of those who take too long to pay may cause more trouble than the poor, for it may be that Allah will bless the poor man and he will pay what he owes, whereas if taking too long to pay is a person’s usual habit, then it will be very difficult to get him to pay it off. The correct view is that the seller may cancel the deal in order to protect his wealth.\nAnother benefit [of being allowed to cancel the deal], in addition to protecting the seller’s wealth, is that it will serve as a deterrent to the one who takes too long to pay, because if such a person knows that if he takes too long to pay, the deal will be cancelled, he will shape up and will not take too long to pay in the future.""(Ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘ (8/364).\nSecondly:\nIt is permissible to stipulate penalty clauses in financial transactions, except in contracts in which there is a commitment to pay off a debt. It is not permissible, for example, to stipulate that the one who purchases land for payment to be made later or by instalments must pay something in addition to the price if he delays payment, because this extra payment is in addition to the original amount of the debt, and that is blatant riba.\nWith regard to duties and obligations other than the debt, it is permissible to stipulate a penalty regarding them, such as if it is stipulated that the one who cancels the deal must pay some money, or if the contractor delays carrying out the work, he must pay such and such for each day.

325739,Who are the scholars who talk about reincarnation of souls and the life cycle?,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly: What is meant by reincarnation of souls\nWhat is meant by reincarnation of souls is that when a person dies, his body dies and his soul is released to dwell in another body, according to what he did of deeds in his previous life, and thus the soul begins a new cycle.\nSee: al-Mawsu‘ah al-Muyassarah fi’l-Adyan (2/728).\nSecondly: Belief in reincarnation of souls constitutes disbelief (kufr)\nBelief in reincarnation of souls constitutes disbelief (kufr). We have discussed this in the answer to question no. 14379 .\nAl-Qadi ‘Iyad said: Likewise, we definitively state that he is a disbeliever who believes in the reincarnation of souls and says that they keep moving from one body to another for ever and ever, and that they will suffer torment or enjoy bliss in those bodies, according to whether they are good or evil.""(Ash-Shifa’\xa02/1067-1077).\nAd-Dardir al-Maliki said: A person becomes a disbeliever if he believes in reincarnation of souls. In other words, the one who says that whoever dies, his soul will move to another body like his, or one that is superior to it if the soul was obedient, or he will move to one that is inferior to it or similar to it if the soul was disobedient, is a disbeliever, because this is denying the resurrection.\nEnd quote from ash-Sharh as-Saghir (6/147-148); Hashiyat ad-Dasuqi ‘ala ash-Sharh al-Kabir (4/269).\nThe Permanent Committee was asked: The philosophy professor told us that the soul moves from one human body to another. Is that true, and if it is true, how can it be the soul that is punished and brought to account, because if it moves then another person will be brought to account?\nThey replied:\nWhat the philosophy professor told you, about the soul moving from one human body to another, is not true. The basic principle regarding that is the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And [mention] when your Lord took from the children of Adam - from their loins - their descendants and made them testify of themselves, [saying to them], “Am I not your Lord?” They said, “Yes, we have testified.” [This] - lest you should say on the day of Resurrection, “""Indeed, we were of this unaware.”}\xa0[Al-A‘raf 7:172].\nThe explanation of this verse is to be found in the report narrated by Malik in his Muwatta’, according to which ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) was asked about this verse (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And [mention] when your Lord took from the children of Adam - from their loins - their descendants and made them testify of themselves, [saying to them], “Am I not your Lord?” They said, “Yes, we have testified.” [This] - lest you should say on the day of Resurrection, “""Indeed, we were of this unaware.”}\xa0[Al-A‘raf 7:172].\n‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) being asked about it, and the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah, may He be exalted, created Adam, then He touched his back with His right hand and brought forth some progeny from him, and He said: ‘I have created these for Paradise, and they will do the deeds of the people of Paradise.’ Then He touched his back and brought forth some progeny from him, and He said: ‘I have created these for the Fire and they will do the deeds of the people of the Fire…’”\nIbn ‘Abd al-Barr said: Regarding the meaning of this hadith, which was soundly narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) via many proven isnads from ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab, ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ood, ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib and Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with them all) and others,\nAhl as-Sunnah wa’l-Jama‘ah are unanimously agreed on that. They said that saying that the soul moves from one body to another is expressing the belief of those who believe in reincarnation, who are the worst of disbelievers and this belief of theirs is the falsest of falsehoods.""(Fatawa al-Lajnah\xa0 2/435).\nThirdly: The scholars who talk about reincarnation of souls\nAmong those scholars who spoke about the reincarnation of souls are the following:\nAl-Fasl fi’l-Milal wa’l-Ahwa’ wa’n-Nihal by Ibn Hazm (1/76 ff).\nAthar al-Milal wa’n-Nihal al-Qadimah fi Ba‘d al-Firaq al-Muntasibah ila al-Islam, by Dr. ‘Abd al-Qaadir ibn Muhammad ‘Ata Sufi (69).\nIbn al-Qayyim also spoke about it in his books ar-Ruh (304) and Tariq al-Hijratayn (249-250).\nFor more information, please see: ar-Ruhiyyah al-Hadithah by Dr. Muhammad Muhammad Husayn (may Allah have mercy on him).']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/325739/reincarnation-of-souls
