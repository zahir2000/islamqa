393085,My sister swore that she would recite Tabarak every night. but she could not do this for 10 years. because she was feeling very tired. what should my sister do?,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIf a Muslim swears to perform an act of obedience, it is recommended for them to fulfill their oath and not to break it.\nAl-Mardawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said, ""Fulfilling an oath regarding a recommended act is preferable."" End quote from ""Al-Insaf"" (27/497).\nMeaning: If the subject of the oath is a recommended act, then fulfilling the oath is preferable to breaking it.\nIf one breaks the oath and does not do what they swore to do, then they must offer expiation for the oath, by consensus of the Jurists.\nAl-Wazir Ibn Hubayrah (may Allah have mercy on him) said, ""They have unanimously agreed that a deliberate and binding oath is when one swears by Allah to do something in the future, whether to do it or not to do it, and if one breaks the oath, expiation becomes obligatory on them."" End quote from ""Hashiyah Ibn Al-Qasim `Ala Ar-Rawd Al-Murbi`"" (7/469).\nSecondly:\nAllah the Almighty mentioned the expiation for an oath in the Quran: {Allah will not impose blame upon you for what is meaningless\xa0in your oaths, but He will impose blame upon you for [breaking] what you intended of oaths. So its expiation\xa0is the feeding of ten needy people from the average of that which you feed your [own] families or clothing them or the freeing of a slave. But whoever cannot find [or afford it] - then a fast of three days [is required]. That is the expiation for oaths when you have sworn. But guard your oaths.\xa0Thus does Allāh make clear to you His verses [i.e., revealed law] that you may be grateful.}\xa0Surat Al-Ma\'idah (5:89).\nThis has been explained in detail in the answer to question number (45676 ).\nThirdly:\nIf a Muslim offers expiation for their oath, then this expiation cancels out the oath, making it as if it never existed.\nAl-Qurtubi said in his Tafsir (18/185), ""Allah\' saying (translation of the meaning): {Allah has already ordained for you [Muslims] the dissolution of your oaths}\xa0means the expiation of the oath is its dissolution.""\nMeaning: If you wish to make lawful what you have sworn upon."" End quote.\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said, ""{Allah has already ordained for you [Muslims] the dissolution of your oaths}... The meaning is: Allah has prescribed for you the dissolution of the oath, which is its annulment, the opposite of binding. And for this reason, those among our companions and others, like Abu Bakr `Abd Al-`Aziz, have used this verse as evidence for expiation before breaking the oath, because the dissolution does not occur after breaking the oath; for by breaking the oath, it is dissolved; and the dissolution only occurs if the expiation is given before breaking the oath, so that the oath may be dissolved, and after breaking the oath, it is only an expiation; because it expiates what is in the breaking of the oath from the cause of sin due to breaking Allah\'s covenant."" End quote from Majmu` Al-Fatawa (35/253).\nFrom this, it is understood that the dissolution of an oath occurs by one of two things: either by breaking the oath or by offering the expiation before breaking it.\nBased on this, what is obligatory upon your sister is to offer the expiation for the oath, and by this, her oath will be dissolved, and nothing else is required of her.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/393085/breaking-an-oath-for-several-years
21756,What is the ruling on praying Witr at the time of `Isha’ when travelling and shortening the obligatory prayers?,"['Praise be to Allah.Shortening prayers while travelling\xa0\n“Travelling is a reason which permits the four-Rak`ah prayers to be shortened to two Rak`ahs , rather it – i.e. travel – is the reason which dictates shortening four Rak`ah prayers to two Rak`ahs , and this is either obligatory or recommended, depending on the differences in scholarly opinion.\xa0\nThe correct view is that shortening prayers is recommended and is not obligatory; although there are some texts which apparently indicate that it is obligatory, there are other texts which indicate that it is not obligatory.”\xa0\nThe four-Rak`ah prayers are Dhuhr, `Asr and `Isha, and the evidence for that is the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and the consensus of the ummah.\xa0\nIn the Quran, Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And when you (Muslims) travel in the land, there is no sin on you if you shorten the prayer if you fear that the disbelievers may put you in trial (attack you).” [An-Nisa’ 4:101]\nAnd evidence is to be found in the actions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) travelled, he would pray two Rak`ahs. It was not narrated from him that he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) ever prayed four Rak`ahs whilst travelling, rather during all of his journeys, long and short, he would pray two Rak`ahs .”\xa0\nWith regard to the consensus of the Muslims, this is something which is a well-known and well-established part of the religion, as Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I prayed behind the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and Abu Bakr, ‘Umar and `Uthmaan, and they never prayed more than two Rak`ahs when travelling.” And the Muslims are agreed upon that.\xa0\nPraying Witr when combining ‘Isha with Maghrib\xa0\nThe traveller may pray Witr after praying `Isha with Maghrib and praying them at the time of Maghrib.”\xa0(See Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, vol. 1, p. 412; al-Sharh al-Mumti’, vol. 4, p. 502; Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, vol. 8, p. 144)\nFor more details about Witr, please refer to these answers: 46544 , 36793 , 32577 , 216236 , and 65692 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21756/how-to-pray-witr-if-you-combine-maghrib-with-isha
391952,What are the main differences between giving gifts & Sadaqa?,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nBoth a gift and charity involve giving money to others without compensation. However, the difference between them is that a gift is intended to foster affection towards the recipient, whereas charity is solely for the sake of reward and drawing closer to Allah, regardless of the recipient.\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n""Charity is what is given for the Face of Allah, as pure worship without any specific person in mind, nor seeking any benefit from them; rather, it is placed where charity is needed, like for those in need.\nAs for a gift, it is intended to honor a specific person; either out of love, friendship, or to fulfill a need... When this is understood: charity is superior unless there is a meaning in the gift that makes it better than charity: like giving to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) during his life out of love for him. And like giving to a relative to uphold family ties, or to a brother for the sake of Allah: this may be better than charity."" End quote from ""Majmu` al-Fatawa"" (31/269).\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n""Know that giving money voluntarily can be a gift, a present, or charity. What is intended for the reward of the Hereafter in itself is charity, what is intended for affection and reconciliation is a gift, and what is intended for the benefit of the giver is a present (Hibah). This is the difference between them, and affection and reconciliation are intended by the Shari`ah and aimed for the reward of the Hereafter, but the reward of the Hereafter is not the primary intention, and for this reason, it is specified for a particular person. As for charity, it is not specified for a particular person, but any poor person encountered is given, and all have in common that it is a pure donation for which the giver asks nothing in return."" End quote from ""Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti`"" (11/65).\nSecondly:\nOngoing charity is what a person gives in charity, and its reward continues for him after his death as long as it is being benefited from, and for this reason, scholars have explained it as an endowment, because it is what continues to be benefited from for a long time; thus, the reward continues for the one who endowed it.\nAl-Manawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in ""Fayd al-Qadir"" (1/602):\n""Ongoing charity is that which continues after him, like an endowment."" End quote with adaptation.\nAnd Qadi `Iyad (may Allah have mercy on him) said in ""Mashariq Al-Anwar"" (1/281):\n""(Or ongoing charity) means: its benefit and reward continue and last."" End quote.\nAnd Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n""Ongoing charity is that which continues to be benefited from, and for this reason, it is called ongoing, because it does not stop.\nNon-ongoing charity is that which is only benefited from at its time.\nFor example: If you give a poor person a thousand riyals, which he spends in a month or two; the charity ends.\nBut if you endow a building, a house, or a shop, to have its revenue go to the poor: then the charity is ongoing as long as its revenue exists. Printing books and beneficial things is ongoing charity, as long as people benefit from them, it is ongoing in reward, ongoing in merit."" End quote.\nThus, a gift is not considered ongoing charity, as it is enjoyed for a limited period, then it disappears and ends.\nPlease see the answer to question no. (122361 ).\nTherefore, a gift is not considered ongoing charity, as it is enjoyed for a limited period, then it ceases and ends.\nThirdly:\nWhat appears is that what you give to your poor aunt is charity, not a gift, because you give it to her due to her need and poverty. However, the matter depends on your intention and purpose; it is possible to intend a gift for your relative, despite her need; otherwise, as long as you give it for the sake of need and intend by that to draw closer to Allah, it is charity.\nCharity to relatives is better than to others, as it carries two rewards: the reward of charity and the reward of upholding family ties.\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: ""Charity given to a poor person is charity, and to a relative, it is two things: charity and upholding family ties."" Narrated by An-Nasa’i (2582) and authenticated by Al-Albani.\nFourthly:\nIf you give your parents money as a token of love for them, it is a gift, and its reward is immense, as it falls under being dutiful to parents, which is one of the greatest righteous deeds.\nIt has been previously explained that charity, although superior to a gift in principle, a gift may be better than it if it is for a close relative, as upholding family ties, along with the gift, may have a greater reward than charity to someone distant.\nAnd there is no closer kinship than that of parents; so upholding ties with them through gifts and the like is from the great dutifulness towards them.\nFor benefit, please see the answer to question no. 34614\nIf your father then donates this money to build a mosque or something else, the basic principle is that the reward is for him, as the money became his property by your gifting it to him.\nNevertheless... it is hoped for you to have goodness and reward, and that you share in the reward, because you were the cause of him donating this money.\nThe Grace of Allah is vast, and no worker\'s reward is lost with Him.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/391952/the-difference-between-a-gift-and-charity
103055,"I graduated as a radiology technician in the Norton Hospital in America. They offered me a job last week, but it seems that they will not give me a day off on Fridays to perform Jumu`ah prayer. What is the ruling?","['Praise be to Allah.Is Jumu`ah prayer obligatory?\nIt is obligatory on the one who can hear the call to prayer on Friday and is one of those for whom Jumu`ah is obligatory -- that is he is a male, Muslim, accountable and free (not a slave) -- to respond to the call. Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“O you who believe (Muslims)! When the call is proclaimed for the Salat (prayer) on the day of Friday (Jumu`ah prayer), come to the remembrance of Allah (Jumu`ah religious talk (Khutbah) and Salat (prayer)) and leave off business (and every other thing), that is better for you if you did but know!” [Al-Jumu`ah 63:9]\nAnd the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “People must cease neglecting Jumu`ah , or Allah will put a seal over their hearts and they will truly be among the negligent.” (Narrated by Muslim, 865)\nValid excuses for missing Jumu`ah prayer\nThere are some excuses that make it permissible for a Muslim to miss Jumu`ah prayer , such as being sick or doing essential work that he cannot leave in order to offer Jumu`ah prayer , as in the case of one who is treating the sick or dealing with emergency cases in the hospital, or one who works as a security guard for a place of great importance, and other such jobs.\nBased on that, if your presence in the hospital at the time of Jumu`ah prayer is necessary for dealing with emergency and accident cases, and there is no one else you can do this job apart from you, then there is nothing wrong with your not attending Jumu`ah prayer in that case, and you may pray it as Dhuhr .\nBut if your staying in the hospital at that time is not necessary, because there are others who could do the work besides you, then there is no excuse for you to miss Jumu`ah prayer , and you have to\xa0look for another job which will not conflict with your Islamic duty. If a person gives up something for the sake of Allah, Allah will compensate him with something better than it.\nWe ask Allah to make what is good easy for you wherever it is.\nFor more details, please refer to the following category: Friday Prayer.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/103055/valid-excuses-for-missing-jumuah
