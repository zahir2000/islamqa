225234,I heard that it is Sunnah to wash new clothes before putting them on for the first time. Is this true?,"['Praise be to Allah.It is recommended in the prophetic Sunnah to offer supplication when putting on new clothes, so the Muslim should say: “Allahumma laka al-hamd, anta kasawtanihi, as-aluka min khayrihi wa khayri ma suni‘a lah, wa a‘udhu bika min sharrihi wa sharri ma suni‘a lah\xa0(O Allah, to You be praise, You have clothed me with it. I ask you for its good and the good of that for which it was made, and I seek refuge in You from its evil and the evil of that for which it was made).” Narrated by Ahmad (11248) and Abu Dawud (4520); classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami‘ (4664).\nThis has been discussed previously in the answer to question no. 139146 .\nAs for washing new clothes before wearing them, we do not know of anything in the Sunnah to indicate that it is recommended to do that, and we do not know of anyone among the earlier generations or the scholars who recommended doing that or advised doing it.\nBut it may be advisable from a medical point of view, because doctors advise that it is essential to wash new clothes before wearing them, especially underwear and children’s clothes, because of bacteria or chemical contaminants that may have got onto them.\nThere is nothing wrong with that, if it is proven to be of benefit. Islamic teachings do not disallow that, because Islam brought general principles that advise maintaining good physical health and cleanliness.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/225234/is-it-sunnah-to-wash-new-clothes-before-wearing-them
21869,"I am a woman, I live in one city and I travel with my husband to another city for some purpose or to walk about and go shopping. Sometimes, the time for Maghrib or ‘Isha comes and we go and look for a mosque that has room for women to pray, but we cannot find such a place. So my husband prays but I cannot find a place to pray.","['Praise be to Allah.Is it permissible to pray in the car?\nWhat you did is not correct, because standing when one is able to do so is an essential part of the prayer. You could pray in the mosque, in the men’s room, after the men have left. If you cannot find a mosque then you can pray on the ground in any place.\xa0\nPraying in cars , planes, trains or other means of conveyance, where one cannot face the qiblah or pray standing, is not permissible in the case of obligatory prayers unless two conditions are met:\xa0\n\nThere should be the fear that the time for the obligatory prayer will end before reaching your destination. But if you will reach your destination before the time for prayer is over, you should wait until you get there to pray.\xa0\nIt should not be possible to get off and pray on the ground. If it is possible to do so then you must do that.\xa0\n\nIf these two conditions are met, then it is permissible to pray in the vehicle . The evidence for it being permissible to pray in this case is the general meaning of the verses in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope.” [Al-Baqarah 2:286]\xa0\n“So keep your duty to Allah and fear Him as much as you can.” [Al-Taghabun 64:16]\xa0\n“and [Allah] has not laid upon you in religion any hardship.” [Al-Hajj 22:78]\nCan you pray sitting in the car?\nIf it is said, if I am allowed to pray in these vehicles, should I face the qiblah and should I pray sitting even though I am able to stand?\xa0\nThe answer is:\xa0\nIf you are able to face the qiblah throughout the prayer, then you must do that, because it is a condition of an obligatory prayer being valid whether one is travelling or not.\xa0\nIf it is not possible to face the qiblah throughout the prayer , then fear Allah as much as you can and do your best, because of the evidence narrated above.\xa0\nThis has to do with obligatory prayers. With regard to supererogatory (nafl) prayers, the matter is more relaxed; it is permissible for the Muslim to pray in the vehicles mentioned no matter what direction they are facing, even if he could get down on the ground at some times, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to pray nafl prayers on his mount no matter what direction it was facing.\xa0\nJabir narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) “used to pray voluntary prayers when he was riding without facing the qiblah .” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1094).\xa0\nBut it is better to face the qiblah when starting to pray a nafl prayer, if that is possible when travelling.\xa0(See Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 8/124)\xa0\nIs offering obligatory prayers sitting down allowed?\nWith regard to offering obligatory prayers sitting down when one is able to stand, that is not permissible because of the general meaning of the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And stand before Allah with obedience.” [Al-Baqarah 2:238]\n\xa0‘Imran ibn Husayn narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to him: “Pray standing; if you cannot, then sitting ; and if you cannot then lying on your side.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1117)\xa0\nAnd Allah is the Source of strength.\xa0(Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 8/126)\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21869/can-you-pray-in-the-car
