399630,"I heard that one of the reasons why a person may be punished in the grave is a man who recites the Quran by night but does not act in accordance with it by day. Does this mean that the man never acted in accordance with the Quran at all, or that he only acted in accordance with some of it?","['Praise be to Allah.It was narrated from Samurah ibn Jundub (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said regarding the dream he saw: “As for the man whose head was being smashed with a rock, he is one who studied the Quran but did not act upon it, and he went to sleep, neglecting the obligatory prayers.”\nNarrated by al-Bukhari (1143); it is part of a lengthy hadith narrated in Sahih al-Bukhari (7047).\nSee the hadith of Samurah in its entirety in the answer to question no. 11110.\nFor more information, see the answer to question no. 46068.\nWhat is meant by his head being smashed is that it was being crushed. End quote.\nWhat the hadith refers to is not acting in accordance with the Quran. Ibn Battal said: What it means is that he does not memorize its words or act in accordance with its meanings. As for one who does not memorize its words but does act in accordance with its meanings, he is not included in this hadith, but it is narrated in the hadith that he will be resurrected on the Day of Resurrection with no argument to defend himself. End quote.\nIbn Battal: Sharh Sahih al-Bukhari (3/135, 9/564).\nAt-Tini said: The words “fa naama ‘anhu (he went to sleep and missed it)” mean: he turned away from it.\nThe preposition ‘an (away from) in this phrase is used in the same way as in the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {alladhina hum ‘an salatihum sahun [But] who are heedless of their prayer} [al-Ma‘un 107:5]. In other words, they are heedless in the sense of abandoning it and not paying attention to it. This is the action of the hypocrites and evildoers.\nThe phrase “he went to sleep and missed it” means: he does not recite it at night, and he does not reflect on what the Quran includes of commands that he should follow and prohibitions to which he should pay heed, like the hypocrites and evildoers. If this is how he is at night, then he will not act during the day on what it contains.\nThis interpretation is supported by what is mentioned in another report narrated by al-Bukhari: “As for the man whose head was being smashed with the rock, he is the one who studied the Quran but did not act upon it, and he went to sleep, neglecting the obligatory prayers.”\nAs for the one who sleeps without staying away from the Quran, due to some shortcoming or incapacity, he is not included in this warning.

He said: “As if they are two clouds, or two black canopies, with light between them, or as if they are two flocks of birds in ranks, pleading on behalf of their companions.” Narrated by Muslim (805).\nIt was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar said: There was a time in the past when we learned issues of faith before Quran, and when a surah was revealed to Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), he would learn what it said was halal and haram, and what he should pay attention to in that surah just as you are taught the Quran. Then he said: I have seen men, one of whom learns the Quran and recites it from beginning to end, without learning what it enjoins and forbids, or in which verses he should pause and pay attention, and he reads it at speed, like spreading out dates to dry.\nNarrated by al-Hakim in al-Mustadrak ‘ala as-Sahihayn (1/91, 101).\nAl-Fudayl said: The Quran was revealed to be followed, but people regard reciting it as all that is required of them to do.

130761,What is the evidence for commercial insurance being prohibited?,"['Praise be to Allah.Understanding the prohibition of commercial insurance\nCommercial insurance which is offered by most insurance companies is a kind of prohibited contract, whether it is insurance covering one’s life or possessions or anything else. The fact that it is prohibited is indicated by a number of texts and Shar`i principles, such as:\nThe ambiguity in insurance contracts\n\nInsurance is a transaction that involves ambiguity, and transactions that involve ambiguity are forbidden according to Shari`ah.\n\nMuslim (1513) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade ambiguous transactions.\nGharar in Arabic means a risk which\xa0is not certain; it may happen or not, such as selling fish in the water or birds in the air, because the purchaser may or may not get it.\nAl-Azhari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Gharar transactions include any transactions in which something is not known.\xa0\xa0(Mu`jam Maqayees Al-Lughah, 4/380-381; Lisan Al-`Arab (6/317).\nAl-Khattabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe root meaning of the word ambiguity is that which is wrapped up and concealed from you. Any transaction which is based on ambiguity or on inability to achieve something is Gharar. There are many kinds of ambiguity, which all involve not knowing exactly what the transaction involves.\xa0 (End quote)\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWith regard to the prohibition on ambiguous transactions, this is a very important principle with regard to commercial transactions, and includes many issues, such as selling things that are not present or are unknown, and so on. All of these are invalid transactions because there is ambiguity with no reason for that.\nSome kinds of ambiguity may be tolerated when engaging in a transaction if there was a reason for it, such as not knowing about the foundations of the house; this transaction is still valid because the foundations belong to what can be seen of the house, and because there is a reason for this, as it is not possible to see the foundations.\nThey unanimously agreed that it is invalid to sell foetuses that are in utero and birds in the air. The scholars said: The reason for it being invalid is because of ambiguity. (End quote)\nThe scholars agreed that a great deal of ambiguity is not permissible, but a little of it may be overlooked. They differed as to what constitutes a little or a great deal.\xa0(Bidayat Al-Mujtahid, 2/187; An-Nawawi said something similar in Sharh Muslim)\nInsurance policies are among the contracts that involve a great deal of ambiguity; even lawmakers themselves have affirmed that insurance contracts are based on probabilities, which means ambiguous, because neither the insurer nor the insured can know at the time of entering into the contract what he will give or take. The person who takes out insurance may pay one instalment, then an accident may happen and the insurer is obliged to give what he agreed to give to him, or perhaps nothing will happen at all, so he will pay all the instalments and not take anything.\nThe element of gambling in insurance\n\nInsurance contracts are a kind of gambling\n\nGambling is prohibited, as it was forbidden by Allah, when He said (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Intoxicants (all kinds of alcoholic drinks), and gambling, and Al-Ansab (stone altars for sacrifices to idols etc), and Al-Azlam (arrows for seeking luck or decision) are an abomination of satan’s handiwork. So avoid (strictly all) that (abomination) in order that you may be successful.} [Al-Ma’idah 5:90]\nWhat is meant by gambling is when a person pays something of his own money and takes a risk: either he will gain more than it or he will lose the money that he paid.\nInsurance is a transaction that is connected to a risk that may or may not happen, so it is, in effect, gambling, because the person who takes out insurance is taking the risk by paying the premium. Either he will take more than it or he will lose it if the risk against which he is insured does not happen.\nThe person who is insured may pay twenty and take one thousand, or he may pay one thousand and take one thousand, or he may pay one thousand and not take anything if the risk against which he was insured does not happen.\nIs this not taking risks and gambling?\nThe presence of Riba in insurance contracts\n\nInsurance involves Riba An-Nasi’ah and Riba Al-Fadl, in the event that compensation is paid\n\nMuslim (1587) narrated that `Ubadah ibn As-Samit (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Gold for gold, silver for silver, wheat for wheat, barley for barley, dates for dates, salt for salt, like for like, same for same, hand to hand. But if these commodities differ, then sell as you like, as long as it is hand to hand.”\nThis Hadith indicates that if a person sells gold for gold, it must be equal amounts and the exchange completed in the same sitting.\nSo it should be sold gram for gram, with nothing added, and the exchange must be completed in the same sitting. It is not permissible for the two parties to separate without each of them having taken what is due to him.\nIf a person sells gold for gold with a difference in the amount, then they have fallen into riba Al-fadl. If the exchange is not completed then they have fallen into Riba An-Nasi’ah, i.e., interest charged when hand-to-hand exchange is delayed.\nIf gold is sold for silver then the exchange must be completed in the same sitting, and it is permissible for there to be a difference in the amounts. So a gram of gold may be sold for 10 g of silver, for example, but it is not permissible for them to separate without the exchange having been completed.\nCurrency comes under the same ruling as gold and silver in this regard. It is not permissible to exchange one currency for another unless the exchange is completed in the same sitting. If the currency is all the same, then it must be like for like and the exchange should be completed, just as if gold were being exchanged for gold.\nInsurance includes Riba of both types: Riba Al-Fadl and Riba An-Nasi’ah.\nWhat that means is that what the insurance gives to the person who takes out insurance, or to his heirs, if the risk defined in the contract happens, will be one of three things: either it will be less than what he paid or more than that or equal to it.\nIn all these cases what the company gives to the insured person happens after he pays the insurance instalments during a period of which the end is in fact unknown.\nSo the reality of the transaction is that it is paying money for money to be given at a later date.\nIf the amounts are equal, then this is Riba An-Nasi’ah; if more [or less] is paid, then it is Riba Al-Dadl and An-Nasi’ah, both of which are prohibited on their own so how about if they are combined?\nConsuming wealth unlawfully through insurance\n\nInsurance is consuming people’s wealth unlawfully\n\nConsuming people’s wealth unlawfully is prohibited.\nAllah Says (interpretation of the meaning): {O you who believe! Eat not up your property among yourselves unjustly except it be a trade amongst you, by mutual consent.} [An-Nisa’ 4:29]\nWhat is invalid is every way which is not permitted by Shari`ah, and which involves stealing, betrayal, robbery, gambling, Riba-based contracts and corrupt transactions. This was stated by Abu Hayyan (may Allah have mercy on him) in his commentary on this verse.\nWhat is meant by insurance involving consuming people’s wealth unlawfully is if the money paid by the insurance to the person who is insured is more than he paid — such as if the risk occurs after paying just one instalment — then on what basis is he entitled to this money? And if the risk does not occur, then on what basis is the insurance company entitled to the payments made by the person who was insured without anything in return?\nStatistics by a German expert have proven that the ratio of payments made by insurance companies in compensation to individuals is equivalent to no more than 2.9% of the total amount of payments made.\nOn what basis is the insurance company entitled this money, and in return for what?\nThe imposition of Non-Shar`i obligations\n\nInsurance contracts make obligatory things that are not obligatory according to Shari`ah\n\nInsurance contracts oblige the insurance company to pay compensation, if the risk against which insurance was taken happens. On what basis is this made binding? The insurance company did not cause the danger or make it happen; it did not commit any acts of aggression or shortcoming, so how can it be forced to pay compensation for something for which it is not liable according to Shari`ah?\nThe social and individual harm of insurance\n\nInsurance harms both individuals and society\n\nIn addition to what is mentioned above, insurance is not free of other harmful effects, among the most important of which are the following:\nTaking things lightly: it makes the people insured careless about protecting their property against calamity; they may even go further than that and cause accidents or make accidents worse. This causes a great deal of harm to individuals. For example, some drivers whose lives and cars are insured may become careless and not pay heed to traffic laws and regulations, which exposes individuals to harm caused by accidents and car crashes.\nEach one of these reasons is sufficient to indicate that commercial insurance is prohibited and that insurance contracts are invalid contracts which are not permitted by Shari`ah, and that it comes under the heading of consuming people’s wealth unlawfully. So how about when all these reasons are combined?\nHence the majority of contemporary scholars have ruled that all forms of commercial insurance are prohibited. Statements have been issued by the Council of Senior Scholars in the Land of the Two Holy Sanctuaries and by the Islamic Fiqh Councils in Jeddah and Makkah, that commercial insurance is prohibited according to consensus, and not one member of the Council disagreed.\nWe have quoted a great deal of these statements and fatwas in the answers to various questions on our site.\nSee a lengthy discussion of commercial insurance in Abhath Hay`at Kibar Al-`Ulama`, 4/33-315.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/130761/why-is-commercial-insurance-prohibited
178636,"I am a student studying engineering and water management. I am interested in finding out about ways in which we can solve the problem of misuse of water, such as in the case of wudu’, which leads to wasting a lot of water.","['Praise be to Allah.It is important to highlight the beauty of Islam and draw attention to its superiority, and the fact that following its laws and rulings will lead to all that is good. With regard to the issues that a person learns about religious matters, he may think initially that there is something wrong with the religion and that it should be criticised, but then, after thinking and reflecting on its objectives, it will become clear that his initial impression was completely wrong.\nThe way in which Islam deals with the issue of water and its emphasis on being economical with water when purifying oneself and doing wudu’ is based on two things:\n-1-\nIslam is keen for people to purify and cleanse themselves both physically and spiritually. Therefore the believer purifies himself of his sins five times a day when he does wudu’ for every prayer. If the believer does wudu’ five times a day, and washes each body part three times, there is no better way of cleaning oneself than that.\nAn-Nasa’i (103) narrated from ‘Abdullah as-Sanabihi that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When the believer does wudu’ and rinses his mouth, sins come out of his mouth. When he rinses his nose, sins come out of his nose. When he washes his face, sins come out of his face to the extent that they even come out from beneath his eyelashes. When he washes his hands, sins come out of his hands to the extent that they even come out from beneath his fingernails. When he wipes his head, sins come out of his head to the extent that they even come out of his ears. When he washes his feet, sins come out of his feet to the extent that they even come out from beneath his toenails. Then his walking to the mosque and his prayer will earn him additional reward.” Al-Albani classed it as authentic in Sahih an-Nasa’i.\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) spoke of purifying oneself from sins by doing wudu’ and praying, comparing that to cleansing oneself of dirt, when he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “What do you think, if there was a river by the door of one of you and he bathed in it five times a day, would any speck of dirt be left on him?” They said: Not a speck of dirt would be left on him. He said: “That is the likeness of the five prayers, by means of which Allah erases sins.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 528 and Muslim, 667)\nHow beautiful is the likeness that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) gave to highlight the virtue of cleansing oneself of sin through wudu’ and prayer, by likening it to cleansing oneself of dirt with water.\n-2-\nWith regard to being economical in using water when purifying oneself and not being extravagant with it, this issue could be discussed on the basis that Islam calls for being economical and following guidelines on consumption, and tells us not to be extravagant in all things. So the point we should highlight when speaking about Islam and the issue of being economical with water when doing wudu’ is that Islam instructs us to be moderate in all things and not go to extremes in anything, including wudu’.\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAllah, may He be glorified and exalted, sent down in His holy Book verses which speak of extravagance and wastefulness and forbid both, and which praise those who are moderate and righteous in their actions with regard to food, drink and all expenditures.\nSo there should be no extravagance, no waste, no stinginess, no miserliness, no going to extremes and no negligence. Thus Allah prescribes moderation in all things, which includes the prohibition on going to extremes. Therefore people are forbidden to go to extremes, as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Beware of going to extremes in religion, for those who came before you were only destroyed because of going to extremes in religion.”\nAnd Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {O People of the Scripture, do not commit excess in your religion} [An-Nisa’ 4:171]. His forbidding that to them also applies to us. Negligence and falling short are both forbidden; rather we must do what we are obliged to do, refrain from that which is forbidden to us, and strive to do good, without going to extremes or being negligent.\nGoing to extremes means doing more than is prescribed in Islamic teachings, as in the case of one who is not content to do wudu’ as it was prescribed, so he does more and uses water extravagantly; he is not content to wash his hands and feet three times, so he adds to that. This is a type of going to extremes in something that Allah has prescribed. The same may be said with regard to the adhan, the iqamah, fasting and so on.\nAdding to what is prescribed in Islamic teachings is described as going to extremes, excess and innovation. Falling short in prayer by doing less than is required and not doing it properly is called negligence and carelessness. The same applies to expenditure; we should not be extravagant or wasteful and we should not be stingy or miserly; rather we should be somewhere in between those extremes, for the best of matters are those that are moderate, as Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {Thus We have made of you an Ummah [nation, community] justly balanced} [Al-Baqarah 2:143].\nIslam teaches moderation in all things, and tells us that we should not go to extremes, be negligent or go to excess. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {O children of Adam, dress well every time you offer prayer [or perform tawaf]. Eat and drink, but do not exceed the bounds, for He does not love those who exceed the bounds} [Al-A‘raf 7:31]. In this verse, Allah, may He be glorified, instructs us to take dress well because our clothing covers the ‘awrah and because it is beautiful. Elsewhere He says: {But the garment of piety is best} [al-A ‘raf 7:26]. The garment of piety is belief in Allah, and piety means obeying Allah, following that which pleases Him and refraining from what He has prohibited. This is the greatest garment, the garment of piety.\nThen Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {Eat and drink, but do not exceed the bounds} [Al-A‘raf 7:31]. This is a command to eat and drink, because food and drink contain nourishment that will preserve health, well-being and physical strength, for not eating and drinking leads to death, and that is not permissible. Rather it is obligatory to eat and drink as much as will maintain health, so the individual should be moderate in that regard in order to preserve his health and maintain his well-being. He should not eat and drink to excess, which would lead to indigestion, sickness and various diseases, and he should not fall short in that, which would damage his health; rather he should be somewhere in between the two extremes. Hence Allah says: {but do not exceed the bounds}.\nThis extravagance in all things is one of the evils of this world. Hence the believer should be moderate in all his affairs, and the believing woman should be moderate in all her affairs. (End quote from Fatawa Ibn Baz, 4/10 9-112).\nPerhaps you will have noted from the above how Islamic teachings direct the Muslim to be moderate in doing wudu’. As Islam has enjoined that, it has also enjoined being moderate in all things, as it enjoins that when prescribing wudu’ five times every day and night, washing each body part three times.\nThus the beauty of Islamic teachings is clear to anyone who has eyes to see. Islam enjoins a kind of cleanliness that is unmatched, and there is nothing that is purer both outwardly and inwardly. Yet it instructs us to be economic when doing that and not go to extremes, which is based on the fundamental teachings and general guidelines of Islam, which enjoin that and urge people to adhere to that, and applies that to minor issues of those fundamental principles.\nWe ask Allah to help and guide you.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/178636/highlighting-the-beauty-of-islam-through-its-prohibition-on-extravagant-use-of-water
108125,I want to know the Islamic view on the topic of stem cells and cell banks. A cell bank is a place where a person’s stem cells are stored in return for a fee for a certain length of time — several years — so that they can be used in the future if needed.,"['Praise be to Allah.The Role of Stem Cells in Medical Treatments\nThe cells referred to in the question, stem cells, are extracted from the umbilical cord after birth. These cells that are taken from it play a role in rebuilding blood cells and strengthening the immune system of patients with blood diseases such as leukaemia (blood cancer) and anaemia. They may also be used to treat neurological diseases such as brain paralysis, Alzheimer’s and so on.\nThese cells are not attacked by the immune system, because they quickly develop into a neutral state. The umbilical cord looks somewhat like a rope; it connects the foetus in the uterus to the placenta. It contains two arteries and one vein. The arteries take blood carrying waste material from the foetus to the placenta, and the vein takes blood carrying oxygen and nutrients from the mother’s blood to the foetus.\xa0(End quote from Al-Mawsu`ah Al-`Arabiyyah Al-`Alamiyyah)\nSources of Stem Cells: Ethical Considerations in Islam\nThere are three sources for stem cells:\n\nStem cells taken from human embryos between the ages of 5 days and two weeks.\nStem cells taken from adults, which are collected in two ways:\n\n\nFrom bone marrow, i.e. from the bone itself, such as from the bones of the pelvis or chest. The problem with this method is that it is regarded as painful and requires a general anaesthetic; it also takes a long time, in addition to the fact that the amount of stem cells collected in this manner is very small.\n\n\nFrom blood. This requires a large amount of blood to be taken, then filtered, but in the end only a very small amount of stem cells is obtained.\n\n\nThe last and most important source of stem cells is the umbilical cord, which is a rich source of these cells; it may contain as many as 200 million stem cells!\n\nAre Stem Cell Banks Permissible in Islam?\nHence the idea developed of keeping these cells in “banks”. In Dubai there are public and private stem cell banks, and in Jeddah there is a private company that stores cells for those who want that, in return for a fee. These banks implement measures to guarantee that the cells will not be tampered with; the owner can also follow up and check on them just as he can check on the money in his bank account.\nSome doctors have stated that it is possible to preserve these cells for up to 25 years, and some doctors say that it is possible to store them for life.\nCan Stem Cells Be Donated or Sold?\nThese cells are useful not only for their owner who may be affected by diseases in which he can benefit from them; rather he can also donate them to others. Stem cells have indeed been used to treat cases of sickness and they have been a successful alternative to the risky procedure of transplanting bone marrow. From a medical point of view, stem cells are regarded as an alternative to organ donation, as it is possible to regenerate the patient’s damaged cells.\nFor their owner, they are a perfect match for his cells, and he is the only one who has a perfect match. Among members of the same family, the likelihood of a match varies between 25% to 40%. All of this, of course, applies so long as the mother does not have any communicable diseases such as hepatitis or AIDS. Hence it is essential to carry out tests on the mother’s blood before collecting the stem cells.\nBased on that, if an individual keeps them for himself, there should be no difference of opinion that it is permissible.\nIslamic Stance on Abortion and Stem Cell Use\nBecause of these benefits in the cells that are taken from the umbilical cord, some of those who do not fear Allah hastened to obtain umbilical cords by means of deliberate abortion. We are sorry to say that some of those whom people trusted with their lives did that.\nHence there was a clear statement by the Islamic Fiqh Council that it is prohibited to carry out deliberate abortions for the purpose of using the embryo’s organs – including stem cells, of course. There follows the text of the statement:\nIn the session of the Islamic Fiqh Council, held during its sixth conference in Jeddah, KSA, 17-23 Sha`ban 1410 AH (14-20 March 1990 CE), after studying the research and recommendations on this subject – which was entitled Using Foetuses as a Source for Organ Transplants – which was also one of the topics of the sixth Medical Fiqh conference held in Kuwait, 23-26 Rabi` Al-Awwal 1410 AH (23-26 October 1990 CE) – in cooperation between this Council and the Islamic Medical Sciences Organization, the following was determined:\n\nIt is not permissible to use foetuses as a source for organs that are needed for transplant into another individual except in some cases that are subject to conditions that must be met:\n\n\nIt is not permissible to deliberately induce abortion for the purpose of using the foetus in order to transplant organs into another individual. Rather abortion should be limited to that which is natural and spontaneous (i.e., miscarriage) and not deliberate, or abortion that is carried out for a legitimate shar`i reason. Surgery should not be resorted to in order to extract the foetus except where that is necessary in order to save the mother’s life.\nIf the foetus is viable (i.e., could survive), then medical treatment should focus on saving and preserving its life, and it should not be used for organ transplants. If the foetus is not viable, it is not permissible to use it except after its death, subject to conditions mentioned in statement no. 1 of the fourth conference of this Council, which discusses one human benefiting from the organs of another human, living or dead.\n\n\nIt is not permissible to use the process of organ transplant for commercial gain under any circumstances.\nIt is essential to delegate responsibility for supervision of organ transplants to a committee of specialist and trustworthy individuals. End quote.\n\nIs it permissible to use stem cells in Islam?\nIt seems – and Allah knows best – that it is permissible to make use of the cells found in the umbilical cord, especially when the cord is usually discarded.\nThe Fiqh Council of the Organization of the Islamic Conference issued a statement concerning this matter during its session that was held on 18 Jumada Al-Akhirah 1408 AH (6 February 1988 CE). The text of this statement follows:\nFirstly: it is permissible to transplant an organ from its place in a person’s body to elsewhere in his body, whilst making sure that the expected benefit from this procedure outweighs any potential harm, and on condition that this is done for the purpose of replacing a missing organ or reshaping it, or changing its function, or correcting a defect or removing a deformity that is causing psychological or physical pain. (End quote)\nShaykh Ibrahim Al-Fayyumi – Secretary General of the Islamic Research Council in Egypt – said:\nThe Council found that generating and growing tissues and cells in order to benefit from them in treating humans is done by using stem cells, and there is nothing wrong with that. This is based on what was mentioned by Professor Dr. Ibrahim Badran – a member of the Council and former Minister of Health.\nAnd he said:\nIslam does not prevent science that is beneficial to man. The Council is following with interest everything that is new in this important branch of science, and acknowledges that growing stem cells opens a new door to treatment that will reduce dependency on organ transplants from deceased persons or donors. It will give a greater opportunity to help patients whose illness is incurable, especially in cases of liver, kidney and heart disease.\nAnd he said:\nThere is no Shar`i reason to disallow setting up banks to store stem cells, so long as they are used for treating humans. (End quote)\nIs it permissible to donate sperm or eggs for producing zygotes?\nWe should point out that it is not permissible for anyone to donate sperm or eggs for the purpose of producing zygotes (fertilised eggs) which will then develop into the foetus with the aim of obtaining the stem cells from it. It is also not permissible to use cloning in order to obtain foetal stem cells. Rather permission is limited to obtaining stem cells from umbilical cords.\nA statement was issued by the Islamic Fiqh Council, no. 54 (6/5) on the topic of transplanting brain cells and nerve cells, the text of which is as follows:\nThe session of the Islamic Fiqh Council that was held during the sixth conference in Jeddah, KSA, 17-23 Sha`ban 1410 AH (14-20 March 1990 CE), after studying the research and recommendations on this topic that was one of the topics of the sixth Medical Fiqh conference held in Kuwait, 23-26 Rabi` Al-Awwal 1410 AH (23-26 October 1990 CE) – in cooperation between this Council and the Islamic Medical Sciences Organization, and in light of the conclusions reached by the conference referred to, and knowing that this does not mean transplanting the brain of one person to another person; rather the aim of this transplant is to treat a defect in specific cells in the brain that are not able to excrete sufficient chemical or hormone substances, so they are supplemented with similar cells from another source; or it is done to treat gaps in the nervous system that result from some injuries, the Council determined the following:\n\nFirstly: if the source of the tissue is the adrenal gland of the patient himself, and there is an advantage in that because it will not be rejected by his immune system as the cells are from the same body, there is nothing wrong with that from a Shar`i point of view.\nSecondly: if the source is an animal foetus, there is nothing wrong with this method if it can be successful and there are no Shar`i reservations. Doctors have stated that this method has been successful in different kinds of animals and it is hoped that it will be successful whilst taking the necessary medical precautions to avoid rejection by the immune system.\nThirdly: if the source of tissues is living cells from the brain of an early embryo – as old as ten to eleven weeks – the ruling varies according to the following:\n\n\nThe first method: taking the tissue directly from a human foetus in the mother’s uterus by opening the uterus surgically; this method results in death of the embryo as soon as the brain cells are taken, and it is haram unless it happens after spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) or an abortion that is permitted in Shari`ah in order to save the mother’s life, and after ascertaining that the foetus has died, whilst paying attention to the conditions which will be mentioned on the topic of using embryos in statement no. 59 (6/8) of this session.\nThe second method: this is the method which may be brought about in the near future, which involves growing brain cells in “farms” in order to make use of them. There is nothing wrong with this from a shar`i point of view, if the source of the cells is legitimate and they were obtained in a manner that is Islamically permissible.

Trustworthy organisations should be in charge of this matter and these cells should be collected in ways that are Islamically acceptable, in order to treat those who need transplant of cells.\nIslamic Fiqh Council’s Statement on Stem Cell Research\nAfter writing the above, we came across a statement of the Islamic Fiqh Council attached to the Muslim World League on the topic of stem cells, which agrees with what we have stated above. We will post it here to summarise what is stated above and to give it precedence over other statements, because it is the opinion of virtuous scholars who are specialised in medicine and Shari`ah.\nThe statement of the Islamic Fiqh Council:\nThe Islamic Fiqh Council of the Muslim World League, in its seventeenth conference in Makkah Al-Mukarramah, 2003 CE, discussed the topic of transplanting stem cells on the basis of the sources of these cells, in accordance with the recommendations of the organisation in its sixth conference in 1989 CE, as mentioned above. In the third statement of the Islamic Fiqh Council, dated 17/12/2003 CE, it says the following:\nStem cells, which are the original cells from which the embryo is created, have the ability – by Allah’s leave – to develop into different types of cells in the human body. Scientists have recently been able to find out about these cells and to isolate them and grow them with the aim of using them for medical treatment and various scientific experiments. Hence they can be used to treat disease and they are expected to have a great impact in the future in treating many diseases and physical deformities, including some types of cancer, diabetes, kidney and liver failure, and so on.\nThese cells can be obtained from numerous sources, including the following:\n\nThe embryo at the blastula stage, where it forms a sphere of cells from which the various cells of the body will grow. Zygotes (fertilised eggs) produced in attempts at in-vitro fertilisation are regarded as the main source. It is also possible to deliberately fertilise an egg from a donor with sperm from a donor in order to obtain zygotes, and grow them until they reach the blastula stage, then extract the stem cells from them.\nAborted foetuses at any stage of pregnancy.\nThe placenta or umbilical cord\nChildren and adults\nCloning, which is done by taking a cell from an adult human, then extracting its nucleus and inserting it into an egg from which the nucleus has been removed, with the aim of reaching the blastula stage, then obtaining stem cells from it.\n\nAfter listening to the research presented on this topic and the opinions of members, experts and specialists, and finding out about this type of cells and their sources, and the ways in which they may be used, the Council took the following decision:\n\nFirstly: it is permissible to obtain stem cells and grow them, and use them for medical treatment or permissible scientific research, if the sources are permissible. That includes, for example, the following sources:\n\n\nAdults if they have given permission and that will not cause any harm.\nChildren, if their guardians have given permission, if it is done for a legitimate purpose and without harming them.\nPlacentas and umbilical cords, with the permission of the parents.\nSpontaneously aborted foetuses (i.e., miscarriage) or foetuses from abortions that were carried out for medical reasons permitted by Shari`ah, with the permission of the parents.\n\nWe should also be reminded of the seventh resolution of the twelfth session, about cases in which it is permissible to abort a pregnancy.\n\nSpare fertilised eggs (zygotes) from attempts at in-vitro fertilisation, if there are any and they have been donated by the parents; it should be noted that it is not permissible to use them for an illegitimate pregnancy.\n\n\nSecondly: it is not permissible to obtain stem cells and use them if their source is prohibited, such as the following, for example:\n\n\nFoetuses that have been aborted deliberately without any medical reason that would make that permissible according to Shari`ah.\nZygotes that result from fertilisation of donor eggs with donor sperm.\nCloning.
