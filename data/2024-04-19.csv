129880,"There was a minor issue between me and my wife, and I swore an oath by Allah to my wife that I would not go near her (have intercourse with her) for two months, and if I did that, she would be divorced. What is the ruling on that? If I go near her during the specified period, will she be divorced or do I have to offer expiation for breaking an oath (kaffarat yamin)?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIf a man swears that he will not have intercourse with his wife for a period of less than four months, this is ila’ (an oath of abstinence) according to the most correct scholarly opinion, and it is the view of a number of the Tabi‘in. So if he does not have intercourse with her throughout that period, he does not have to do anything, but if he does have intercourse with her during that period, he must offer expiation for breaking an oath.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: An-Nakha‘i, Qatadah, Hammad, Ibn Abi Layla and Ishaq said: Whoever swears an oath that he will not have intercourse with his wife for a short period of time or a long period of time, and he does not have intercourse with her for four months, then this is ila’ (an oath of abstinence), because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{For those who swear not to have sexual relations with their wives is a waiting time of four months}\xa0[Al-Baqarah 2:226].\nThis is an oath of abstinence.""(Al-Mughni\xa0 7/415).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Regarding the words ‘More than four months’, the apparent meaning of the author’s words indicates that if he swears that he will not have intercourse with her for four months only, that is not ila’ (an oath of abstinence), or if he swears that he will not have intercourse with her for three months, that is not ila’ (an oath of abstinence) either. However, the correct view is that it is ila’ (an oath of abstinence), because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{For those who swear not to have sexual relations with their wives is a waiting time of four months}\xa0[Al-Baqarah 2:226].\nSo Allah confirms that it is ila’ (an oath of abstinence), but He stipulated that the period they must wait for is four months. So if someone says: By Allah, I will not have intercourse with my wife for three months, then this is ila’ (an oath of abstinence), because he has sworn not to have intercourse with her, but we do not say anything to him for now, because once that period (three months) has passed, his oath is no longer binding. For example, a man says to his wife: By Allah, I will not have intercourse with you for a period of three months. In this case, we say: This is ila’ (an oath of abstinence), but we do not impose on him the consequences of that oath; rather we wait until three months have passed, and once that period ends, the ruling on his oath is no longer binding.""(Ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘\xa0 13/218).\nSecondly:\nWith regard to your saying, ‘If I go near her, she will be divorced,’ this is a divorce that is dependent upon a condition being met. The majority of jurists are of the view that divorce takes place when that condition is met, so if you have intercourse with her, it counts as one divorce (talaq).\nSome of the scholars are of the view that reference should be made to the husband’s intention. If he intended that divorce should take place when the condition was met, then it counts as one divorce, but if he did not intend that divorce should take place – rather he wanted to threaten her or prevent himself from doing that – then this is an oath for which he must offer expiation when it is broken. This is the more correct view, and it is the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) and others.\nWhat we think is that you should keep away from your wife until the two months are over, so as to avoid divorce taking place, because the majority of scholars, including the four imams, regard divorce as taking place in a case such as this.\nWhat is strange is that you hastened to swear this oath and issue a conditional divorce even though the problem between you and your wife was minor, as you mentioned. What the husband should do is fear Allah, may He be exalted, and adhere to the limits He has set, and not use divorce as a means to issue threats or vent his anger.\nWe ask Allah to rectify all our affairs.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/129880/he-swore-that-he-would-not-go-near-his-wife-for-two-months-and-if-he-did-so-she-would-be-divorced
153442,"I work for a company, and when I apply for a job in another company, they ask me to tell them how much my current salary is. In the beginning, I could not find any opportunity to work for a salary that I deserve on the basis of my qualifications and experience, so I was forced to work for nearly half of that. Is it permissible for me, when I apply for a job and am asked about my current salary, to mention the salary that I deserve? Please note that the salary for the new job will be decided on the basis of my current salary.","['Praise be to Allah.If the Muslim is asked about his salary, it is not permissible for him to lie, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The signs of the hypocrite are three: when he speaks he lies, if he makes a promise he breaks it, and if he is entrusted with something he betrays that trust.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (33) and Muslim (59).\nIbn Mas‘ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Lying is not good, whether in earnest or in jest.\nNarrated by al-Bukhari in al-Adab al-Mufrad (387); classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Adab.\nIf you think that telling them your salary will be detrimental to you, you can refuse to answer, or you can explain to them that you accepted this low salary for some specific reason, and the like.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/153442/it-is-not-permissible-for-one-who-applied-for-a-job-if-he-is-asked-about-the-salary-he-is-currently-receiving-to-lie-about-it
161383,I was told that it was prohibited to eat or to bring food into the bathroom but when I told someone about this they laughed and said I was wrong. What is the ruling?,"['Praise be to Allah.Bathrooms are for relieving oneself, not for eating and drinking, so it is not appropriate for the Muslim to enter them except for the purpose of relieving himself, and when he enters the bathroom he should refrain from eating and drinking until he comes out.\xa0\nIf a person eats and drinks inside the bathroom when there is no need to do so, then he has done something which is contrary to sound human nature (Fitrah).\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about the ruling on eating and drinking in the bathroom.\xa0\nHe replied:\xa0\n“The bathroom is a place for relieving oneself only and one should not stay there longer than is necessary. Eating or doing other things there requires staying there for a length of time that is not appropriate.""
