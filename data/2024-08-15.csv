318312,"A while ago, I swore an oath regarding my children that neither I nor their father would buy them any electronic devices again. When I was visiting my family, my husband called me and told me that he had bought electronic devices for the children, because he forgot that I had sworn an oath that we would not buy such things. Do I have to offer expiation for the breaking of my oath (kaffarat yamin)?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nSwearing that someone else should not do a certain thing is a binding oath, the consequences of which are to be borne by the one who swore the oath.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf he said: “By Allah, So-and-so should surely do – or not do – such and such”; or he swore an oath regarding someone who was present, and said: “By Allah, you should surely do such and such,” then he broke the oath and did not do that thing, then expiation must be offered by the one who swore the oath. This was stated by Ibn ‘Umar, the people of Madinah, ‘Ata’, Qatadah, al-Awza‘i, the people of Iraq and ash-Shafa‘i. That is because it is as if the one who swore the oath broke it, so he is required to offer expiation, as if he is the one who did what he swore not to do, and because the reason for offering expiation is either the oath or the breaking of the oath or both. Whichever happened, it has to do with the one who swore the oath. End quote from al-Mughni (13/502).\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhat is meant by swearing an oath regarding someone else is when the oath-maker swears that someone else should surely do such and such. If that person breaks the oath and does not fulfil it, then expiation is to be offered by the one who swore the oath, not the one concerning whom the oath was sworn, according to the majority of jurists. For example, if someone swears an oath regarding his slave or his child or his friend, saying that they must surely do something, then the other person does not do it, expiation must be offered by the one who swore the oath that has been broken. End quote from Majmu‘ al-Fatawa (1/206).\nSecondly:\nIf the person concerning whom the oath was sworn does not fulfil the oath because he forgot, then nothing is required of the one who swore the oath, because if the one who swore the oath did that thing himself because he forgot, then nothing is required of him. That is because the one who forgets is excused and there is no sin on him, and expiation is prescribed to absolve the sin of breaking the oath.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{There is no sin on you if you make a mistake in that regard, but [you are accountable] for what your hearts deliberately intend}\xa0[al-Ahzaab 33:5].\nIt was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas said: Allah, may He be exalted, revealed the words: { Allah does not place on any soul a burden greater than it can bear. For it is what it has earned, and against it is what it has committed. Our Lord, do not hold us accountable if we forget or fall into error} [al-Baqarah 2:286]. Allah said: I have granted that. Narrated by Muslim (126).\nIt says in ar-Rawd al-Murbi‘ (3/1554).\nIf he swears an oath regarding himself or someone else over whom he has authority and who would fulfil his oath, intending to prevent that person, such as his wife or child, from doing something, then that person does it out of forgetfulness or ignorance, the oath is broken and the divorce or manumission of a slave come into effect… That is, in contrast to an oath sworn explicitly by Allah, may He be exalted, and the like, because this is the right of Allah, and He has already forgiven this ummah for what it does by mistake or out of forgetfulness. End quote.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf he does the thing concerning which the oath was sworn out of forgetfulness or ignorance, then the scholars said that in the case of an oath that one’s wife would be divorced or one slave would be manumitted if someone else did the thing mentioned in the oath, then the oath is broken and the divorce and manumission will come into effect. But they said regarding an oath sworn explicitly by Allah that the oath is not broken [if the other person does the thing concerning which the oath was sworn to prevent him doing that thing]. But the correct view is that there is no difference and the oath is not broken in either case, just as it is not broken in the case of an oath sworn explicitly by Allah. This applies if the person who swore the oath swore it regarding himself.\nBut if he swore an oath regarding someone else, to prevent him from doing something, either swearing explicitly\xa0 by Allah, saying that his wife would be divorced or his slave would be manumitted [if he did that thing], or making a vow, then one of two scenarios must apply to the other person.\nThe first scenario is that the person concerning whom the oath was sworn is someone who would usually comply with his oath and refrain from the matter in question. In other words, if the person swears an oath concerning him, he will comply with his oath, because of ties of kinship, marriage or friendship.\nThe second scenario is that this other person is someone who would not comply with his oath, and would not care about it, as we will discuss below.\nIf this other person is someone who would usually comply with his oath and fulfil it, and would not go against it, because of ties of kinship, marriage or friendship, such as if he swears an oath regarding his wife, that she should not do something, then she does it out of forgetfulness or ignorance; or he swears an oath regarding his child, son or daughter, that the child should not do something, then the child does it out of forgetfulness or ignorance, this other person comes under the same ruling as the one who swore the oath, as if he is him. So if he does it out of forgetfulness or ignorance in the case of an oath that was sworn explicitly by Allah, the oath is not broken, but if it has to do with manumission or divorce, then the oath is broken [and the divorce or manumission comes into effect].\nFor example:\nA man says to his son: “If you do such and such, your mother is divorced,” then the child does that thing out of forgetfulness; is the mother divorced? Yes, she is divorced according to the madhhab.\nIf he says to his son: “If you do such and such, then my slave is free,” then the child does that thing out of forgetfulness, the oath is broken and the slave is manumitted, just as if he swore the oath regarding himself.\nBut the correct view is that the oath is not broken, just as if he swore the south explicitly by Allah, may He be glorified and exalted.""(Ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘\xa0 15/2 02).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/318312/she-swore-an-oath-regarding-her-husband-and-he-did-not-fulfil-her-oath-because-he-forgot
175051,,"['Praise be to Allah.Is saying `Rabb Ighfir Li’ mandatory?\nThe scholars differed concerning the ruling on the Takbirs of movement in the prayer and on saying between the two prostrations, “Rabb Ighfir Li (Lord forgive me).” There are two opinions:\n\nThe first opinion, which is the view of the majority of Hanafis, Malikis and Shafi`is, is that the Takbirs of movement and saying “Rabb ighfir li (Lord forgive me)” between the two prostrations come under the heading of the Sunnahs of prayer and are not obligatory parts of the prayer.\nThe second opinion is that they are obligatory parts of the prayer. This is the view of the Hanbalis.\n\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Mughni (1/298): The well-known view narrated from Ahmad is that the Takbir said when going down and coming up, the Tasbihs of bowing and prostration, saying “Sami`a Allahu liman hamidah, Rabbana wa laka Al-hamd (Allah hears those who praise Him, our Lord to You be praise)”, saying “Rabb ighfir li (Lord forgive me)”, saying “Rabb ighfir li (Lord forgive me)” between the two prostrations, and the first Tashahhud, are all obligatory. It is also the view of Is-haq and Dawud.\nAnd it was narrated from Ahmad that it is not obligatory, which is the view of most of the jurists, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not teach it to the one who prayed improperly, and it is not permissible to delay explaining something at the time when it becomes necessary.\xa0\nMoreover, Ibn Qudamah quoted a number of things to indicate that it is obligatory:\n\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) enjoined it, and his instruction indicates that something is obligatory.\nHe did it and he said: “Pray as you have seen me praying.”\nAbu Dawud (856) narrated from `Ali ibn Yahya ibn Khallad from his paternal uncle that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The prayer of one of the people is not complete unless he does wudu’ … Then he says: Allahu Akbar, then bows.” Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud.\nBecause the points at which these Adhkars are recited are pillars or essential parts of the prayer, dhikr at these points is obligatory, just as there are words to be recited when standing.\n\nWith regard to the Hadith about the one who prayed improperly, it is mentioned in the Hadith that we narrated that he (the Prophet, blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) taught him that. It is something additional that must be accepted.\xa0 The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not teach you all the obligatory parts of the prayer, based on the fact that he did not teach the Tashahhud or the Salam. So it is to be understood as meaning that he limited it to teaching him only that which he had seen him doing improperly.”\nIt says in Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah (4/40):\nWhen sitting between the two prostrations, it is Sunnah to pray for forgiveness, according to the Hanafis, Malikis and Shafa`is, and it is one opinion that was narrated from Ahmad. The basis that is to be found in the report narrated by Hudhayfah, according to which he prayed with the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and he used to say between the two prostrations: “Rabb ighfir li, Rabb ighfir li (Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me).”\nHowever, asking for forgiveness here is not obligatory, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not teach it to the one who prayed improperly. The well-known view of the Hanbalis is that it is obligatory. This is also the opinion of Is-haq and Dawud, and saying it one time is sufficient.”\xa0\nThis is a matter concerning which there is a difference of opinion among the scholars. The most that can be said is that the view of the Hanbalis, that the Takbirs of movement are obligatory, is more likely to be correct, because of the evidence mentioned above, and because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The imam has been appointed to be followed, so when he says Takbir, then say Takbir…” (Narrated by Muslim, no. 411)\nWith regard to the Du`a between the two prostrations, the opinion of the majority, which is that it is recommended, is more likely to be correct, because there is no evidence to clearly indicate that it is obligatory.\nWhat to say between Sujud\nIt is better for the worshipper to recite Du`as that have been narrated in the texts between the two prostrations. With regard to adding to the Du`as that have been narrated, or saying a Du`a that was not narrated , what appears to be the case is that it is permissible.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/175051/is-saying-rabb-ighfir-li-mandatory
487612,"How do we respond to those Christians who claim that the Quran was plagiarized from the Bible due to the similarities between both religions such as the concept of Paradise and Hellfire, Day of Judgement, common Prophets such as Noah, Moses, Jesus, Adam, etc, and other similarities between the two books.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe claim that the Quran was plagiarized from the Scriptures of the People of the Book is an ancient and recurrent specious argument that is aimed at a single conclusion: knowing that the similarity between the Holy Quran and the Bible, if it is not explained that it is because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) took it from the scriptures of the People of the Book –\xa0 directly or through an intermediary – then there is no other conclusion than to accept that the source of this similarity is the fact that they both came from a divine source.\nBut if there is no way that the people can accept the divine origin of the Quran, then there remains no other option except to strive hard to propagate this claim and spread it among people, telling them that the Quran was plagiarized from the scriptures that came before it.\nThe aim behind that is to disprove the divine origin of the Quran and to fabricate the lie that it was of human origin.\nSecondly:\nThe discussion of how the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) could have learned the stories of the People of the Book, then transmitted them in the Quran – meaning that it was not revelation – is a discussion of various scenarios in which he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) could have learned the stories directly from their holy books, or learned what the scriptures contained of stories, commands and prohibitions, verbally from the People of the Book, if it was not possible for him to study their books himself.\nThis specious argument is based on a number of claims, which are strongly connected to it. If these claims are proven to be baseless, then the conclusions drawn from them will also be proven to be baseless, and this specious argument will lose its foundation and can no longer be valid.\nThese claims may be summed up in three basic claims:\n1. The claim that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was not unlettered or illiterate.\n2. The claim that the Christian scriptures were available to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and he could quote from them or copy them.\n3. The claim that Makkah was a major educational centre for scriptural studies.\nWe will address these three claims briefly and prove them to be unfounded, by Allah’s leave.\nThirdly:\nThe illiteracy of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him):\nOne of the ways of learning about the stories of the People of the Book is learning them directly from their scriptures. This is only possible for one who had the means to learn, and the means to learn have to do either with the learner or the material from which he wants to learn.\nWith regard to the one who wants to learn, we must address the claim that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was not unlettered or illiterate.\nWith regard to the material from which the learner wants to learn, we must address the claim that Arabic translations were available before the Prophet’s mission began.\nThe idea that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was unlettered or illiterate undermines the claim that the Quran was plagiarized from the scriptures of the People of the Book. Therefore there is no way that they could prove this claim, unless they prove that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was not unlettered.\nThose who hold this view followed an unfair method to prove that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was not unlettered. They sought out weak reports or ambiguous statements, or they based their arguments on far-fetched interpretations of some texts, and they ignored the clear, unambiguous texts.\nThe reason for interpreting the texts in this manner is the desire to reach the conclusion they wanted by accusing the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) of plagiarism and denying the divine origin of the Holy Quran.\nThe text of the Quran and Sunnah in many places clearly indicate, leaving no room for doubt, that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was indeed unlettered and that he never narrated any of the stories of the People of the Book before the revelation came to him, and he never wrote anything with his own hand. He knew nothing of the stories before his mission began, and he never spoke of them before that.\nThese texts formed an insurmountable obstacle for the Orientalists and missionaries, and the way in which they dealt with them was one of two ways: either they rejected the many religious texts which affirmed that he was unlettered, and regarded them as an Islamic fabrication with no basis in historical reality, or they accepted these texts in general, but interpreted them in a manner that is not indicated by the linguistic meaning of the words and the context of the Quran and hadiths.\nBoth methods of dealing with the text are flawed; the methodology is flimsy and shows clear bias.\nTo discuss their argument in detail is something that cannot be done in this brief answer. There are books written specifically to address this specious argument and refute it in detail.\nBut because of the importance of this topic – which is affirming that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was unlettered – we will mention some of the evidence from the Holy Quran and corroborating reports from the Prophet’s Sunnah, which prove with certainty that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) could neither read nor write.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{You were not able to read any book before this [Quran], nor were you able to write anything with your right hand. In that case the followers of falsehood would indeed have had cause to doubt}[al-‘Ankabut 29:48].\nThis unambiguous verse clearly states that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not study the scriptures of the People of the Book. It also clearly states that he did not copy anything from them. In other words, this verse affirms that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) had no knowledge of the scriptures of the People of the Book.\nThis is a clear and direct refutation of the claim that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) had knowledge of the scriptures of the People of the book and had studied them in depth.\nOther verses highlight the fact that the people of Makkah knew that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) had no knowledge of the scriptures of the People of the Book, such as the verses in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Likewise We have revealed to you [O Muhammad] a life-giving message by Our command. You knew nothing of the scripture or matters of faith}[ash-Shura 42:54]\n{Say: If Allah had so willed, I would not have recited it to you, nor would He have made it known to you. I spent a whole lifetime among you before it came to me; will you not then understand?}[Yunus 10:160].\nRegarding evidence from the Prophet’s biography (sirah), which proves that he was indeed unlettered, there is a great deal of such evidence, including the following:\n-1-\nIt was narrated from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), that he said: “We are an unlettered community, we do not write or calculate. The month is like this and like this,” meaning that one time it is twenty-nine and one time it is thirty. Narrated by al-Bukhari (1814) and Muslim (1080).\nThis hadith clearly highlights that what is meant by being unlettered here, which leaves no room for confusion or misinterpretation, is not being able to write and not being able to calculate.\n-2-\nThe books of the Prophet’s biography (sirah) and history make no mention of the Prophet writing down the revelation, or of him writing his letters to the kings himself. Rather the opposite is what is mentioned; the Prophet (blessings of peace and Allah be upon him) had scribes who wrote down the revelation and other things.\nIn a brilliant text of Ibn Khaldun, there is a description of the level of education in the Arabian Peninsula just before the Prophet’s mission began. He says: “Among the Arabs, the skill of writing was rarer than she-camels’ eggs. Most of the people were illiterate, especially the desert-dwellers, because this is a skill that is usually found among city-dwellers.\nHence the Arabs did not refer to the illiterate person as being illiterate; rather they would describe one who knew how to read and write as being knowledgeable, because knowing how to read and write was the exception, not the norm among people. As the religious texts and books of Islamic history did not describe Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) as one who knew how to read and write [which would be something remarkable at that time, so the sources would have mentioned it], it is sufficient for the researcher to bear in mind what was the norm at that time, which is that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not know how to read or write.\nAfter noting the above, it is worth pointing out what Dr. ‘Abd ar-Rahman Badawi said in his book Difa‘ ‘an al-Quran dida Muntaqidihi:\n“In order to assume that their claim is valid, it must be assumed that Muhammad knew Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek, and that he must have had a huge library, containing all the texts of the Talmud and true Gospels, along with some of the works of the Greek Church Fathers [early Christian theologians] and the books of various churches and Christian denominations.\nIn the light of this quotation, it becomes clear that the claim of plagiarism on the part of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) not only requires proof that he was not unlettered, but also requires proof that he had access to a huge library!\nIf they failed to prove that he was not unlettered, then how could they prove that he had access to such a huge library? This is something that is utterly impossible.\nYou should realize that access to such a store of knowledge was not possible for any of the People of the Book themselves at that time, so how about a man of Quraysh?”\nFourthly:\nRefuting the claim that Arabic translations of the scriptures of the People of the Book were available before the Prophet’s mission began:\nResearch regarding this matter should be based on different historical resources, far removed from wishful thinking or historical bias. This research should be based on examining the issue from proper historical resources.\nHere we may examine testimony from the most authentic historical sources, namely the Quran and Sunnah – which are the two most reliable resources for studying the biography of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) – as well as the arguments of some Western academics and the statements of non-Muslims, whom no one could accuse of being sympathetic towards Islam. This is the strongest proof against the missionaries and Orientalists, and is more shocking to them than being struck with arrows.\nThe testimony of the Holy Quran and the Prophet’s Sunnah:\nThe one who studies the life of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) will see that there is no evidence, indication or suggestion that any Arabic translation of the Bible existed at that time. Rather, from studying the Quran and Sunnah, he may understand the opposite of that, namely that there was no Arabic translation available.\nAl-Bukhari narrated in his Sahih (4458) from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: The people of the Torah used to read the Torah in Hebrew and explain it in Arabic to the Muslims.\nTherefore the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not believe the People of the Book and do not disbelieve them. Rather say: We believe in Allah and what He sent down to us.”\nThis hadith indicates that the Jews had a full monopoly on the text and its explanation. If their texts were known in Arabic, there would have been no need for the Jews to read the text or explain it [to the Muslims].\nThis idea is supported by the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{There are some among them who distort the Book with their tongues, so that you would think it is part of the Book, but it is not part of the Book; and they say: This is from Allah, but it is not from Allah. And they tell lies about Allah knowingly}[Al ‘Imran 3:78].\nWhen the Jews used to distort the Book with their tongues, when reading some religious stories, to give the impression that what they were saying was a transmission of what was in their books, the Muslims were unable to check those books in order to find out whether what they were saying was true or not, because the books were not available in Arabic. Hence the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) told the Muslims not to ask the People of the Book about anything. This indicates that the People of the Book had a monopoly on knowledge of their Book. Al-Bukhari gave a chapter [in his Sahih] the heading of: The Prophet’s saying: “Do not ask the People of the Book [about anything].”\nPerhaps one of the clearest proofs is the fact that the polytheist Arabs did not refer to this hypothetical translated text when they wanted to deny his prophethood. They had no argument, so they claimed that a young non-Arab man was the one who was teaching the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). If this translated text had been available, they would have said: You read this text, or it was read to you.\nThe Quran mentions their accusation and rejects their accusation of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{We know full well that they say: It is but a man who teaches him. But the one to whom they point speaks a foreign tongue, whereas this is clear Arabic speech}[an-Nahl 16:103].\nThe testimony of Western academics:\nWe will not discuss the statements of academics on this topic in detail. Rather it is sufficient in this regard to mention the conclusions reached through academic research.\nPerhaps the most important book written on this topic is the book of Bruce Metzger, Professor of New Testament Language and Literature, The Bible in Translation, in which he said:\n“It is most likely that the oldest Arabic translation of the Bible dates back to the eighth century.”\nThe Orientalist Thomas Patrick Hughes wrote: “There is no proof that Muhammad had read the Christian Scriptures… It must be noted that there is no clear evidence to suggest that any Arabic translation of the Old and New Testaments existed prior to the time of Muhammad.”\nAlbert Estero said: “Arabic translations of the Bible may have appeared towards the end of Umayyad rule, at the beginning of the eighth century [CE].”\nGreve concluded that “All that one can say about the possibility of there having been an Arabic translation of the Gospel before the emergence of Islam is that there is no definite sign to confirm that.”\nTo sum up, we may note what was quoted by William Henry Bannock, which is like a consensus among the critics, “The view that the Arabic translation of the New Testament only appeared after the emergence of Islam is the view of most of the mid-nineteenth-century critics.”\nFifthly:\nThe claim that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) plagiarized the Quran through an intermediary:\nAfter proving wrong the idea that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was not illiterate, and confirming that there was no Arabic translation of the Bible at his time, it is established that there is no way that he could have found out what was in the scriptures of the People of the Book directly by reading them himself.\nAfter that, our opponents have only one option, which is to assume that Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) learned about the knowledge of the People of the Book from someone else.\nThe idea that the Prophet acquired the revelation from people is an old idea. The polytheists accused him of that, and the Quran refuted them, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And they say: Tales of the ancients that he has written down; they are dictated to him morning and afternoon.\nSay: It [the Quran] has been sent down by Him Who knows all that is hidden in the heavens and the earth. Verily, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful}[al-Furqan 25:5-6].\nAll that our opponents can do in this regard is to suggest some possibilities and mere assumptions, which are no more than false speculation at best, and are based on weird historical stories that cannot stand up to examination, or some reports with very weak chains of narration.\nBased on that, we will examine these assumptions in the light of the Prophet’s biography, the extent of knowledge of some subtle scientific issues that are mentioned in the text that he brought, and the methodology of the hadith scholars in assessing and accepting reports.\nThe Orientalists and their lackeys among the missionaries mentioned the possibility that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) acquired knowledge from others. It is sufficient for us here to discuss the strongest of these possibilities, and to prove that it is flawed.\nThe idea that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) could have acquired the knowledge of the People of the Book before his mission began is one of the most well-known aspersions that the missionaries and Orientalists cast on him and propagated.\nSometimes they claim that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) had a teacher whom he visited frequently in order to learn the knowledge of the People of the Book. They may even quote hypothetical meetings with some scholars of the People of the Book to support this claim.\nThis is an assumption that they make, which needs to be answered in several ways through a critical examination of its origins, including the following:\n-1-\nThe claim that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) had a teacher before his mission began, from whom he learned the knowledge of the People of the Book, necessarily means that he met with that teacher repeatedly over a lengthy period. But the life of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was different from the life of anyone else, for his life at every stage was documented in great detail, which means that his spending a great deal of time in acquiring the knowledge of the People of the Book for the length of time needed to acquire the huge amount of knowledge that he brought to people is an idea that must be rejected out of hand. If his people had been aware of that, they would have mentioned the time and place of this lengthy period of learning, and where the meetings supposedly took place.\n-2-\nEven if we assume for the sake of argument that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) ever met with Jewish and Christian scholars before his mission began, such meetings would not have allowed him to acquire all this vast and precise knowledge, because he did not meet anyone before his mission began – as is stated in the books of his biography – apart from the monk Bahirah, in a very brief meeting, if the report can be proven, and Waraqah ibn Nawfal.\n\nAs for the Prophet’s supposed meeting with the monk Bahirah, it happened when he was twelve years old. From a historical point of view, this story is odd, as was mentioned by adh-Dhahabi and other scholars.\n\nMoreover, even if we assume that this story is proven, it does not lead to the conclusion that the missionaries intended, because this meeting was so brief that it would not be possible for a person to learn anything in such a short time, let alone acquire great, important and weighty information like the revelation that he brought later on.\n\nAs for the Prophet’s meeting with Waraqah ibn Nawfal, it does not make sense – from a rational point of view – to quote it as evidence that Waraqah was a teacher of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) only met Waraqah after the first verses of the Quran were revealed. Moreover, Waraqah himself affirmed the prophethood of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and wished to live long enough to lend great support to him. But Waraqah died shortly after that.\n\nThis is all that happened when they met.\nIn fact, the claim that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) acquired knowledge from the People of the Book when he was in Makkah is a claim that is disproven by the academic and cultural status of Makkah and the true nature of the connection this Arab society had with the knowledge of the People of the Book.\nChristianity had become deeply immersed in idolatry and misguidance, and its followers had become arrogant, as they were described by Isaac Taylor.\nBell said: “There is no strong proof to suggest that Christianity had any centre in the Hijaz, or near Makkah, or even in Madinah, and [people in Arabia] knew very little about the knowledge of the People of the Book. How could such little knowledge enable the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to acquire such vast and precise knowledge of the stories of the People of the Book?\nSixthly:\nAfter proving that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not learn the knowledge of the People of the Book from them directly or through an intermediary, we have no option left except to affirm that it was revelation from Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, to His chosen Prophet.\nThe Quran establishes proof of its divine origin by telling stories of the Prophets and past nations that it mentions:\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{You were not there on the western side [of the mountain] when We decreed for Musa the commission, nor did you witness that event.\nBut We brought forth many nations [after Musa], and a long time has gone by since then. And you [O Muhammad] did not dwell among the people of Madyan, learning from them [the story mentioned in] Our revelation; rather it is We Who have sent you as a Messenger [and revealed to you their stories]}[al-Qasas 28:44-45]\n{This is an account of the unseen [the distant past], which We reveal to you [O Muhammad]; neither you nor your people had any knowledge of it before this. So be patient, for the best outcome is for those who fear Allah}[Hud 11:49]\n{This is an account of the unseen [the distant past], which We reveal to you [O Muhammad]; you were not with them when they cast lots with their pens, [to decide] who, from among them, should be the guardian of Maryam. Nor were you with them when they disputed about it}[Al ‘Imran 3:44].\nSuch verses affirm the prophethood of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and affirm that these stories are revelation from Allah, may He be glorified and exalted.\nImam Abu Ja‘far an-Nahhas says: “Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, stated that as proof of his prophethood for Quraysh, because he did not know how to write and he did not mix with the People of the Book, and there were no People of the Book in Makkah, but he brought them stories of the previous prophets and nations.” End quote from I‘rab al-Quran (3/76).\nThus we see that when the stubborn people rejected the prophethood of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and rejected the divine origin of the Quran, they failed to explain where the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) learned the stories and knowledge of the People of the Book. Hence they resorted to fabrications in an attempt to conceal the light of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, so that it would not reach the eyes of seekers.\nPraise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds.\nReferences:\n1.
