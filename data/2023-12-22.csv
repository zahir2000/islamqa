470736,"Which is better, to slaughter an animal (with the intention of giving the meat in charity) in my country or in a country that is poorer?","['Praise be to Allah.If you have relatives and neighbours in your country who are poor, then giving voluntary charity to them is better, and starting with them is better. The religious texts give precedence to them and encourage us to start with them.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Say: Whatever good you spend should be for parents, kindred, orphans and those in need, and for wayfarers, and whatever good you do, Allah is aware of it}[Al-Baqarah 2:215].\nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “A dinar that you spend for the sake of Allah, a dinar that you spend to free a slave, a dinar that you give in charity to a needy person and a dinar that you spend on your family – the greatest of them in reward is the one that you spend on your family.” Narrated by Muslim (995).\nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed us to give charity, and a man said: O Messenger of Allah, I have a dinar. He said: “Give it in charity to yourself.” He said: I have another. He said: “Give it in charity to your child.” He said: I have another. He said: “Give it in charity to your wife – or he said: your spouse.” He said: I have another. He said: “Give it in charity to your servant.” He said: I have another. He said: “You know best [to whom to give it].” Narrated by Abu Dawud (1691).\nAl-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The ummah is unanimously agreed that charity given to relatives is better than that given to outsiders, the hadiths which speak of this matter are many and well-known. Our companions said: With regard to it being recommended to give voluntary charity to relatives and give them precedence over outsiders, it makes no difference whether the relative is one on whom you are obliged to spend or not. Al-Baghawi said: Giving it to a relative on whom you are obliged to spend is better than giving it to an outsider.""(Al-Majmu‘\xa0 6/238).\nSecondly:\nIf the reasons to give precedence to those mentioned above are not there, then undoubtedly finding another country that is poorer to slaughter an animal there, with the intention of giving its meat in charity, is more appropriate. Hence we see that the verse of zakah gives precedence to those in the greatest need and starts with them. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Zakah [alms] is only for the poor and those in need; those who work to collect it; those whose hearts are to be won over; for the freeing of slaves; for debtors; for the cause of Allah; and for stranded wayfarers. [Thus it is] ordained by Allah, and Allah is All-Knowing, Most Wise}[Al-Tawbah 9:60].\nThus the verse begins with the poor, who are the most in need.\nTherefore a number of scholars allowed sending obligatory zakah to a country that is poorer and in greater need, so it is more appropriate that sending voluntary charity should be permissible.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: There is no shar‘i evidence for defining a limit on the distance beyond which zakah cannot be sent and saying that it is the distance at which shortening the prayers becomes permissible. It is permissible to transfer zakah, and whatever comes under the same ruling, for a shar‘i reason.""(Taqrib Fatawa Ibn Taymiyah\xa0 3/514).\nIt says in a fatwa of the Permanent Committee: “The basic principle regarding zakah is that it should be given to the poor in the city where the wealth is, because of the hadith quoted, but if there is a need to send it elsewhere, such as if the poor people in the country to which it is sent are in greater need, or they are relatives of the one who wants to give it, in addition to being poor, or for some similar reason, it is permissible to transfer it.""(Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Da’imah\xa010/9).\nShaykh al-Sa‘di (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The giver should seek out needy people to give his charity to, and he should not give it to a needy person when there is someone in greater need than him.""(Tafsir al-Sa‘di\xa0 p. 116).\nBased on that, if there are people in the country in which you want to slaughter the animal with the intention of giving its meat in charity who are in greater need than those in your city, because of calamities, war and the like, then it is better to slaughter the animal there, not because the price is cheaper, but in order to meet the need of those who have been stricken by poverty or because some disaster has destroyed the wealth of the Muslims. In the case of voluntary charity, the matter is more flexible.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/470736/can-he-slaughter-an-animal-with-the-intention-of-giving-the-meat-in-charity-in-his-own-country-or-can-he-choose-a-poorer-country
257369,"I have read your articles having to do with Mani and Madhi, but up till now I cannot differentiate properly between them, which is causing me some anxiety, especially since I have read what you say, then I have read other Fatwas, and it is still not clear to me. Is it possible to explain in more detail?","['Praise be to Allah.What is Mani (semen)?\nWhat comes out of a woman may be Mani, Madhi or regular discharge, which is called “moisture”. Each of these has its own characteristics and rulings that apply to it.\xa0\nWith regard to Mani , its characteristics are as follows:\xa0\n\nIt is thin and yellow. This is the description that is narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “The water of the man (semen) is thick and white, and the water of the woman is thin and yellow.” (Narrated by Muslim, 311) However, it may be white for some women.\xa0\nIt smells like pollen when it is still wet, and the smell of date-tree pollen is similar to the smell of dough. Its smell after it has dried is like that of egg whites.\nThere is pleasure and desire when it is emitted, and desire ceases immediately after it is emitted.\n\nIt is not stipulated that all three characteristics appear at once, rather one is sufficient to rule that it is Mani. This was stated by An-Nawawi in Al-Majmu` (2/141).\xa0\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “With regard to the Mani of the woman, it is yellow and thin, or it may be white.\nIt has two characteristics and may be known by one of them:\n\nThe first is that its smell is like the smell of a man’s Mani [which smells like dough].\nThe second is that pleasure is felt when it is emitted, and the pleasure dissipates immediately after its emission [and is followed by languidity]."" (Sharh Muslim\xa0 3/222)\n\nWhat is Madhi?\nWith regard to Madhi, it is white (clear) and sticky, and is emitted when thinking of or wanting intercourse, but no pleasure is felt when it is emitted, and it is not followed by languidity.\xa0\xa0\nThis applies to both men and women. It may be said that it applies more to women than men.\nWhat is moisture?\nWith regard to moisture , this is the discharge that comes from the uterus; it is clear and a woman may not notice it. Women vary in the amount they emit.\xa0\nThus it is clear that the issue of Mani is not confusing, because it has a distinctive smell, and because it is emitted as a result of desire and pleasure is felt when it is emitted. Madhi and moisture do not have that smell.\nHowever, Madhi is emitted after thinking, looking and so on, i.e., after there is desire, although it is not accompanied by desire and pleasure at the time of emission; rather a person may not be aware of it when it is emitted.\nMani is accompanied by desire and pleasure; Madhi is preceded by desire but is not accompanied by that at the time of emission.\nAs for moisture, it is something regular that is not connected to thinking or looking, and is not preceded by desire.\nWhat is most likely with regard to what is mentioned above is that it is Madhi, because it is emitted after thinking about that which provokes desire.\nIf it is not connected to thinking, then it is secretions and moisture.\nAre Mani and Madhi pure?\n\nMani is pure and Ghusl is required after emitting it .\nMadhi is impure and invalidates Wudu , and it must be washed off one’s clothes and body.\nMoisture is pure but it invalidates Wudu.\n\nWhat to do if you are not sure about what has been emitted?\nIf a person is not sure whether what has been emitted is Mani or Madhi, he has the choice to decide what it is, and then should apply the appropriate ruling to it. This is the view of Ash-Shafi‘i (may Allah have mercy on him) and it makes matters easier for the questioner and for anyone who is suffering from Waswasah (whispers from the satan or intrusive thoughts).\nIt says in Mughni Al-Muhtaj (1/215): “If it is possible that what has been emitted may be Mani or may be something else, such as Wadiyy or Madhi, then he may choose and decide which one it is, according to the correct opinion. If he decides that it is Mani then he must do Ghusl; if he decides it is something else then he must do Wudu and wash off whatever has got onto him, because if he decides that it is one of these things, then [by doing what is appropriate in that case] he will definitely have dealt with the matter appropriately. As for the other two things that it could be, in principle they have not happened and he does not have to worry about them.”\nWhat to do if you suffer from occasional emission of Madhi?\xa0\nWhat appears to be the case from your question is that you are affected by Waswasah (whispers from the satan or intrusive thoughts). Our advice to you is that you should ignore it and not pay any attention to it. Do not look at your garment or check to see whether anything came out or not. Rather the one who is affected by Waswasah is advised to sprinkle water on his or her private part and underwear, and if any wetness is seen, then he or she will think that it is the traces of the water that he or she sprinkled on it. Thus the Waswasah will be dispelled in sha Allah.\nShaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“If someone suffers from occasional emission of Madhi, then he may deal with it by making sure to wash it off when cleaning himself [after relieving himself], and sprinkling water around his private part when doing Wudu. Then after that, if intrusive thoughts (Waswaas) come to him, he should say to himself that this is part of the water that he sprinkled so that he may be certain that nothing came out of him.\nSo long as you have the slightest uncertainty, you should ignore this matter and not touch your underwear or check anything.\nHowever, if this moisture is present all the time, then this is more akin to incontinence, so you have to do Wudu when the time for prayer begins, and pray according to your situation, if the Madhi is constant.\nNonetheless, if it only happens sometimes when going out of the house, then it is like urine or wind: if anything comes out, it invalidates Wudu, and if nothing comes out, then praise be to Allah.\nSo long as you feel any uncertainty, even if it is only a little, even if it is only one percent, then do not pay any attention to this matter, and you should regard it as something imaginary that is not true.""(Majmu` Fatawa Ibn Baz\xa0 29/20)\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/257369/the-difference-between-mani-madhi-and-other-secretions
305881,Is garnishing or decorating food one of the objectives of sharia? Or does it come under the heading of excess which is haram?,"['Praise be to Allah.The objectives of sharia are things which Islam prescribes in order to preserve faith, life, reason, wealth and honour. The food that comes under the heading of the objectives of sharia is that which is necessary to sustain life and provide strength and nourishment to the body so that the individual may take care of what he needs for his spiritual and physical well-being.\nGarnishing and decorating food is not one of the objectives of sharia in this sense.\nAl-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said, commenting on the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning), {and eat and drink, but be not excessive} [al-A‘raf 7:31]: As for what is necessary, which is what will ward off hunger and quench thirst, that is recommended on the basis of reason and according to Islamic teachings, because it is necessary to preserve life and faculties. End quote from Tafsir al-Qurtubi (7/191).\nThere is nothing of that which could include garnishing and decorating food.\nIf garnishing and decorating food is not extravagant or excessive, then it is one of the things that are permissible in principle.\nBut if what the questioner means by saying “one of the objectives of sharia” is that it comes under the heading of things that people regard as desirable and is permissible, then yes, it is prescribed and permissible in that sense. In the hadith it says that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Eat and drink, give charity and wear clothes, without showing off or being extravagant.”\nNarrated by Ahmad in al-Musnad (6695); classed as hasan by al-Albani in Sahih al-Targhib wa’l-Tarhib (2145).\nIt was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Eat whatever you wish, wear whatever you wish, so long as you avoid two things: extravagance and showing off.\nNarrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah in al-Musannaf (26492).\nWhat could serve as an indication that garnishing or decorating food is permissible, and that it is regarded as something good, is what was narrated by the Mother of the Believers ‘A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), who said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to like sweets and honey. Narrated by al-Bukhari (5277).\nIbn Battal (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The meaning of this hadith includes everything that is similar to sweets and honey of all kinds of delicious food that are sweet in taste.""(Sharh Sahih al-Bukhari – Ibn Battal\xa0 9/494).\nAl-Khattabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The word sweets (al-halwa’) only applies to sweets that are made by humans.""(A‘lam al-Hadith\xa0 3/2053). This is a type of garnishing or decorating food.\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: al-Nawawi said, when discussing the permissibility of eating two types of fruits and other things together, and the permissibility of eating two types of food together: From this it may be understood that it is permissible to have various types of food when eating, and there is no difference of opinion among the scholars regarding the permissibility of that.""(Fath al-Bari by Ibn Hajar\xa0 9/573).\nBased on that, it is permissible to garnish and decorate food with food of different shapes and types, so long as it does not reach the level of extravagance and showing off.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/305881/does-garnishing-or-decorating-food-come-under-the-heading-of-excess-which-is-haram
225943,"I want to do some kind of exercise to increase my physical strength, but I want to do that in an Islamic manner. Did the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) do this kind of exercise? What is the style of swimming that the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) used to do?","['Praise be to Allah.The strong believer is better and more beloved to Allah\xa0\nMuslim (2664) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The strong believer is better and more beloved to Allah than the weak believer, although both are good.”\nThis strength includes both physical strength and strength of faith, as we have explained in the answer to question no.\xa010238 .\nAllah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And their prophet said to them, `Indeed, Allah has sent to you Saul as a king.’ They said, `How can he have kingship over us while we are more worthy of kingship than him and he has not been given any measure of wealth?’ He said, `Indeed, Allah has chosen him over you and has increased him abundantly in knowledge and stature. And Allah gives His sovereignty to whom He wills. And Allah is all-Encompassing [in favour] and Knowing.’”\xa0[Al-Baqarah 2:247]\n“and has increased him abundantly in knowledge and stature” means: He has favoured him over you and given him more in terms of knowledge and stature; in other words, He has given him deep insight and physical strength by means of which he is qualified for his post as king, for if he has deep insight and the ability to implement the right decision, he will be able to fulfil this role in the best manner, but if he were lacking in either of these two qualities, he would not be able to do his job properly. If he were physically strong but lacked deep insight, then the king would be unsuccessful in running the kingdom’s affairs, because his strength would not be used in a wise manner. If he had deep insight but did not have the strength to implement any decisions he made, his insight would not benefit him because he would not be able to achieve anything."" (Tafsir As-Sa`di, p. 107)\nHaving physical strength, health and soundness helps a person to worship Allah by praying, fasting, performing Hajj, striving in Jihad, and so on. Being physically weak and sick is an impediment in doing many acts of worship.\nWhat are the guidelines of practising sport in Islam?\nThere are matters of Islamic etiquette that one should pay attention to when playing sports and doing exercises to strengthen the body:\n\nSeeking reward with Allah, and doing these things to help one worship Him and support those who have been wronged.\nThese activities should not involve anything that is contrary to Islamic teachings, such as participants bowing to one another , striking the face, uncovering the `awrah, gambling, and so on.\nIt should not distract one from obeying and worshipping Allah, honouring one’s parents and other important priorities.\nOne should not spend great amounts of wealth on it, to the point of extravagance; rather one’s involvement in such activities should be based on moderation and within the framework of Islamic teachings.\n\nDid Prophet Muhammad Exercise?\nWe do not know of anything in the Sunnah to indicate that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to do this kind of exercise or play sports as known nowadays. For Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, perfected His blessings upon him in all his affairs, and granted him perfect physical strength and strength of faith.\nWhat we know of such matters that is proven in the Sunnah is the following:\n\nFirstly: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) wrestled with Rukanah (may Allah be pleased with him) before he became Muslim.\n\nAbu Dawud (4078) narrated that Rukanah (may Allah be pleased with him) wrestled with the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) threw him to the ground. (Classed as sound by Al-Albani in Al-Irwaa’ (5/329)\n\nSecondly: he raced with his wife `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her).\n\nAbu Dawud (2578) and Ahmad (26277) narrated that `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: I went out with the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on one of his journeys when I was still young and had not put on weight. He said to the people: “Go on ahead.” So they went on ahead, then he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to me, “Come, let me race with you.” So I raced with him, and I beat him, and he said nothing. Later, when I had put on some weight, and I had forgotten about it, I went out with him on one of his journeys, and he said to the people: “Go on ahead.” So they went on ahead, then he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to me, “Come, let me race with you.” So I raced with him, and he beat me, then he smiled and said: “This is in return for that.” (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Saheeh Abu Dawud)\n\nThirdly: archery. Al-Bukhari narrated (3373) that Salamah ibn Al-Akwa` (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) passed by a group of Aslam who were competing in shooting arrows. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Shoot, O sons of Isma`il, for your father was an archer. Shoot, and I am with the tribe of So-and-so.” One of the two groups stopped shooting, so the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “What is the matter with you, why are you not shooting?” They said: O Messenger of Allah, how could we shoot when you are with them? He said: “Shoot, for I am with all of you.”\n\nDid the Companions exercise?\nUndoubtedly the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) used to train in horsemanship and the skills of fighting and running, and they were extremely strong and tough.\nSuch matters vary from one time to another, and from one situation to another.\nWith regard to swimming , it is soundly narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that he said: “Everything in which there is no remembrance of Allah is idle play, except four things: a man playing with his wife; a man training his horse; a man running between two lines (as in a race); and a man learning how to swim .” (Narrated by An-Nasa’i in As-Sunan Al-Kubra (8889); classed as authentic by Al-Albani in As-Sahihah (315)\nWe do not know of any report from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) about swimming which suggests that he did it himself.\nWith regard to the words, “Teach your children to swim, shoot arrows and ride horses,” we do not know of any report with this wording from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nA similar phrase was narrated from him, “Teach your sons to swim and shoot arrows, and teach girls to spin.” But this is a very inauthentic Hadith.
