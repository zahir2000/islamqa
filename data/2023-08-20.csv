427571,"The Best and complete ablution performing with many Hadiths with different narrator are mention in the shahieeen but While doing ablution,Wiping on the ear is not mention in the whole bokhari, Muslim. I know it's mention in some one Hadith of tarmizi and nasahi but here question is arise that All the compenions and the narrator of shahieeen not reporting this so this issue is seem like the issue of yafa yadaan. now can we say either it's not Authantic or this is not used often by the prophet (optional) in ablution?","['Praise be to Allah.The fact that al-Bukhari and Muslim did not narrate a particular hadith does not indicate that it is da‘if (weak), because they did not claim that they had collected all the sahih (sound) hadiths, as is affirmed in the books of hadith sciences.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThey (al-Bukhari and Muslim) did not commit themselves to collecting all the sahih reports; rather it is soundly narrated from them that they clearly stated that they did not collect all of them. Rather all they wanted to do was to collect some of the sahih hadiths in their books, similar to the aim of the author of a book of jurisprudence, who wants to discuss some issues of jurisprudence in his book, not to cover all the issues thereof.""(Sharh Sahih Muslim\xa0 1/42).\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nMoreover, al-Bukhari and Muslim did not commit themselves to narrating in their books all the hadiths that are deemed to be sahih. They classed as sahih some hadiths that are not included in their books, and at-Tirmidhi and others narrated from al-Bukhari some hadiths that are not in his book; rather they are in as-Sunan and elsewhere.""(Ikhtisar ‘Ulum al-Hadith\xa0p. 25).\nFurthermore, if they omitted a hadith because they believe that it was da‘if, that does not indicate that there was consensus that it was da‘if. Perhaps they classed it as da‘if whilst other leading scholars classed it as sahih.\nBased on that, the fact that wiping the ears is not mentioned in the hadiths of as-Sahihayn does not mean that it is not prescribed to do that at all. That has been proven by at-Tirmidhi, an-Nasa’i and others, and more than one of the scholars has narrated that there is scholarly consensus that it is prescribed.\nIt was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) wiped his head and his ears, inside and out.\nNarrated by an-Nasa’i (102) and at-Tirmidhi (36), who said: Concerning this issue there is a report narrated from ar-Rubayyi‘,. And the report of Ibn ‘Abbaas is a hasan sahih hadith. End quote.\nIbn ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe Muslims are all agreed that taking water into the nose and blowing it out is part of wudu’, and the same applies to rinsing out the mouth and wiping the ears.\nHowever they differed regarding the one who omits that by mistake or deliberately.""(At-Tamhid\xa0 18/225).\nIbn Hubayrah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThey were unanimously agreed that wiping the inside and outside of the ears is one of the Sunnahs of wudu’, except for Ahmad, who regarded wiping them as obligatory, according to what Harb narrated from him. He was asked about that and he said: He should repeat his prayer if he omits it.""(Ikhtilaf al-‘A’immah al-‘Ulama’\xa0 1/44).\nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 115246 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/427571/it-is-prescribed-to-wipe-the-ears-when-doing-wudu
420158,Do we know what the other forty-five parts of prophethood are?,"['Praise be to Allah.Al-Bukhari ((6989) narrated from Abu Sa‘id, and Muslim (2263) narrated from Abu Hurayrah, from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), that he said: “Good dreams are one of the forty-six parts of prophethood.”\nThe parts of prophethood referred to in the hadith are a matter of the unseen, which cannot be known unless there is a text of the Qur’an or hadith to explain it. Some of the scholars said: That is not known, and the hadith was not said to explain them; rather it was said to explain the importance of good dreams.\nAl-Qadi Abu Bakr ibn al-‘Arabi al-Maliki said: No one knows what the parts of prophethood really are except an angel or prophet. Rather all that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) wanted to do was highlight that dreams are one of the parts of prophethood in general, because in the dream one may learn about some matters of the unseen in some respect. As for the details of the other parts, knowledge of that is something that is for the prophets alone.\nAl-Maziri said: The scholar is not required to know all things in general terms and in detail. Allah has set a limit for the scholar beyond which he cannot go. Therefore he will know some matters in general terms and in detail, and he will know some matters in general terms only, but not in detail, and this is one of those matters.""(Fath al-Bari\xa0 12/364).\nIn the Sunnah there is some explanation about some parts of prophethood, such as the report narrated by at-Tirmidhi (2010) from ‘Abdullah ibn Sarjis al-Muzani, according to which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Carrying oneself in a calm and dignified manner, deliberation and moderation are one of the twenty-four parts of prophethood.” This is a hasan gharib hadith; it was classed as hasan by al-Albani in Sahih at-Tirmidhi. See also: Hashiyat Musnad Ahmad (ar-Risalah edn, 4/432).\nThis is what we could find about the parts of prophethood.\nWhatever the case, what a person needs to know about prophethood and its characteristics, and what it has to do with his religious duties, was conveyed by the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to his ummah, and Allah preserved this knowledge for the ummah, and the leading scholars strove to study it and explain it.\nAs for prophethood itself and its status, that cannot be attained by seeking it or striving to attain it, or by researching its characteristics and learning about its parts, and that was the case even at the times when the prophets were still coming and messages were still being revealed. So how about now, when prophethood and the sending of the messages ended with Allah’s Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and there is no longer any hope of anyone becoming a prophet, for it is proven that there will be no prophet after him, and nothing remains for the one who cares for himself but to seek and learn the legacy of knowledge brought by the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/420158/good-dreams-are-one-of-the-parts-of-prophethood-what-are-the-other-parts
