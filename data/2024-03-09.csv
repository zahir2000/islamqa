382518,"If I follow the view of the Hanbalis about it being permissible to wipe over the headcover that is wrapped under the chin, should I be wearing the headcover directly on my head, or is there nothing wrong with that [wearing a headband and the like]? Because I wear a small cloth (kerchief or headband) under it that goes around the head only, and does not go over the ears or under the chin. Is it sufficient to wipe the headscarf only, and not this piece of cloth?","['Praise be to Allah.It is proven that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) wiped over his turban when doing wudu.\nIt was narrated from Ja‘far ibn ‘Amr ibn Umayyah that his father said: I saw the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) wiping over his turban and khuffs. Narrated by al-Bukhari (205).\nIt was narrated by Ka‘b ibn ‘Ujrah, from Bilal, that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) wiped over his khuffs and headcover. Narrated by Muslim (275).\nAl-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhat is meant by the headcover here is the turban, because it covers the head. End quote from Sharh Sahih Muslim (3/174).\nBy analogy with that, it is permissible for a woman to wipe over her headcover, especially that which goes under the chin. Whatever is prescribed for men is, in principle, also prescribed for women.\nMoreover, the reason is the same, which is to alleviate the difficulty of taking it off and putting it back on again. In fact, women’s need to wipe over their headcovers is often more obvious and greater than that of men, as is quite clear.\nAl-Hasan narrated from his mother, from Umm Salamah, that she used to wipe over her headcover.\nNarrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah in al-Musannaf (224).\nFor more information and to see the views of scholars regarding this matter, please see the answer to question no. 148129 .\nSecondly:\nIn order for it to be valid to wipe over the headcover, there is no stipulation that the headcover should rest directly on the head, because there is no text to that effect. Rather it is sufficient for it to cover the head as socks or khuffs cover the feet, and it is permissible to wipe over them even if there is another pair of socks or khuffs under them. This is the view of the majority of scholars.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If he put the outer khuff on before invalidating his wudu, it is permissible to wipe over it in all cases, whether the inner one is intact or has holes. This is the view of al-Hasan ibn Salih, ath-Thawri, al-Awza‘i and ashab al-ra’y. Malik disallowed that in one of the two reports narrated from him, as did ash-Shafa‘i in one of his two views, because usually there is no need to wear the second khuff, so there is no need for a general concession regarding it, as is the case regarding a plaster cast.\nIn our view, however, if the two khuffs together are covering the foot and it is possible to walk in them, then they are like one khuff, even if the inner khuff has holes. His saying that there is no need for it is not correct, for if the land is cold, it is usually not sufficient to wear just one khuff.""(Al-Mughni\xa0 1/364).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/382518/wiping-over-the-headcover-khimar-when-there-is-a-piece-of-cloth-headband-under-it
81931,I hope that you can explain the following to me:,"['Praise be to Allah.Can you kiss your fiancé in Islam?\nA man and his fiancée are not married ; rather she is still a “stranger” (non-Mahram) to him until the marriage contract is completed. Based on this, it is not permissible for him to be alone with her, travel with her, touch her, or kiss her.\xa0\nNo one should take this matter lightly, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If one of you were to be stabbed in the head with a needle of iron, that would be better for him than touching a woman who is not permissible for him.” (Narrated by At-Tabarani from the Hadith of Ma`qil ibn Yasar (may Allah be pleased with him); classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Al-Jami, 5045)\xa0\nConcerning the ruling on touching one’s fiancée or being alone with her, Az-Zayla`i (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “It is not permissible for him to touch her face or hands – even if there is no fear of desire – because she is still prohibited for him and there is no need for that.” (Radd Al-Muhtar `ala Ad-Durr Al-Mukhtar, 5/237).\xa0\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“It is not permissible for a man to be alone with his fiancé because she is still forbidden, and Islam does not allow anything but looking, so she remains forbidden for him. And because if he is alone with her there is no guarantee that something forbidden will not happen.

333551,"I am a young man from an Arab country. I was working in a shop selling children’s nappies (diapers), and my agreement with the owner of the shop was that I would work as a salesman in return for an-agreed upon wage, and he would register me with Social Security, but he kept procrastinating, so that he would not have to pay fees for Social Security. Please note, that the state requires everyone who has a business registration and has workers to register them with the Social Security fund. After I had worked with him for a year, he dismissed me without notice, and with no legitimate, sound reason. I made a complaint against him with the Labour Inspectorate, and my complaint may be summed up as follows: a demand to be registered with the Social Security fund, a demand for compensation for unfair dismissal, a demand for compensation for annual leave, and other demands that are connected to these basic demands. My question is: am I entitled to make these demands? Is it permissible for me to demand to be registered with Social Security, or should I give up my complaint and delegate my affairs to Allah, may He be glorified and exalted?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIf the work contract mentions a specific period of employment, the boss does not have the right to dismiss the employee before that, because hiring is a binding contract that cannot be terminated except with the consent of both parties, and the employee is entitled to his wages until the end of the contract, so long as he was present and made himself available to work.\nIt says in Kashshaf al-Qina‘ (4/33): The hired worker is entitled to wages for merely making himself available, whether he works or not, because he has done what is required of him.

148129,Is it permissible for a woman to wipe over her head cover?,"[""Praise be to Allah.The scholars differed concerning the ruling on a woman wiping over her head cover ; there are three views:\xa0\n\nThe majority – which was also narrated from Ahmad – are of the view that it is not permissible for her to wipe over it only, and they ruled that if she does that, her Wudu is invalid, unless the head cover is thin and the water can penetrate it.\xa0\n\nIn Al-Mudawwanah (1/124) it says:\xa0\n“Malik said concerning a woman wiping over her head cover : She has to repeat her Wudu and her prayer.”\nWe should point out here that Ash-Shafi`i (may Allah have mercy on him) said that the permissibility of wiping over the head cover depends on whether the report that mentions it is authentic. There are some authentic reports concerning that, such as the Hadith of Bilal (may Allah be pleased with him) in Muslim (275), according to which the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) wiped over his Khuffayn (leather slippers) and head cover. So Ash-Shafi`i (may Allah have mercy on him) should be included among those who allow wiping over the head covers of both men and women.\xa0\n\nThe Hanbalis, according to the other report from their Imam, are of the view that it is permissible to wipe (over the head cover) and the Wudu is valid. This is also the view of Ibn Hazm (may Allah have mercy on him), who said:\xa0\n\n“Anything that is worn on the head, such as a head cover, cap, helmet and chain-mail, and so on, it is permissible to wipe over it, and women and men are the same in that regard, whether there is a reason to do so or not.” (Al-Muhalla, 1/303)\xa0\n\nA third group is of the view that a distinction should be made between that which is difficult to remove and that which is easy. In the first case they regard it as permissible to wipe over it, but not in the second case. This is the view of Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) and, among contemporary scholars, Shaykh Al-`Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him).\xa0\n\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“With regard to a woman wiping over her head cover , there are two reports:\xa0\n\nAccording to the first report it is not permissible, because the texts that speak of the concession only refer to men for sure, whereas there is some doubt as to whether they refer to women.\xa0\nAccording to the second report, it is permissible, and this is the apparent meaning of the general words “Wipe over the Khuffayn and the head cover.” – Narrated by Ahmad (39/325). The commentators said: The Hadith that says that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did that is authentic, but the Hadith that says he allowed it is inauthentic, and women are also included in that, along with men, just as they are included with regard to wiping over the Khuffayn…\xa0\n\nAnd because it is permissible for men to wipe over the head cover, so that is permissible for women too, like men. And because it is clothing that it is permissible to wear on the head and it is usually difficult to take it off, so it is likened to a man’s head cover, and more so, because the woman’s head cover covers more than the man’s head cover, and it is more difficult to take it off, so the woman's need for (this concession) is greater than in the case of the Khuffayn.” (Sharh Al-`Umdah, 1/265, 266)\xa0\nShaykh Al-`Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Whatever the case, if there is some difficulty, either because it is cold or because it is difficult to take it off and put it on again, then there is nothing wrong with being lenient in matters such as this, otherwise it is better not to wipe over it, as there is no authentic text concerning this matter.” (Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti` `Ala Zad Al-Mustaqni`, 1/239)\nThe third view is the one that is most likely to be correct. It is proven from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that he wiped over his head cover, and there is no difference between the head cover of a man and that of a woman; in fact it is more appropriate that this should be permissible in the case of women, because of the reasons mentioned by Shaykh Al-Islam.\xa0\nBased on that, not every head covering may be wiped over; rather if the head is covered with something that might be problematic to take off, as in the case of a woman who fears that her hair may be seen, or she has covered her head to which she has applied henna, or it is very cold and she fears some harm (if she takes off her head cover), and other similar excuses.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/148129/can-i-wipe-over-my-head-cover-during-wudu
93027,What are the things that make Ghusl obligatory?,"['Praise be to Allah.“The things that make Ghusl obligatory are six things. If one of them happens then the Muslim has to do Ghusl .\xa0\n\nEmission of Maniy (semen) from its exit in the male or female, which happens either when one is awake or when one is asleep. If it is emitted when one is awake, there is the condition that one feels pleasure when it is emitted. If it is emitted without pleasure, then Ghusl is not required, such as if it is emitted as the result of sickness. If it is emitted when one is asleep, this is what is called Ihtilam (erotic dream) and Ghusl is required in all cases because he was not aware (of whether there were feelings of pleasure or not) and he may not experience feelings of pleasure. If a sleeper wakes up and finds traces of Maniy, then he must do Ghusl. If he has an erotic dream\xa0but no Maniy comes out of him, and he does not find any trace of it, then he does not have to do Ghusl .\xa0\nPenetration of the penis into the vagina, even if no ejaculation takes place, because of the Hadith narrated by Muslim and others from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “When a man sits between the four parts (arms and legs of his wife) and has intercourse with her, then Ghusl is obligatory.” So Ghusl is required of both parties involved by mere virtue of penetration having taken place, even if no ejaculation takes place, because of this Hadith and because there is scholarly consensus on this point.\xa0\nAccording to some scholars, Ghusl is required when a non-Muslim becomes Muslim, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told some of those who became Muslim to do Ghusl. Many scholars think that it is recommended, not obligatory, for a non-Muslim who becomes Muslim to do Ghusl because it is not narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told everyone who became Muslim to do that. So it may be understood that it is recommended, so as to reconcile the evidence.\xa0\nDeath – the deceased person must be washed, except for the martyr who falls in battle, who is not to be washed.\xa0\nand 6 – Menses and postpartum bleeding, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When your menses ends , then do Ghusl and pray.” And Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And when they have purified themselves” [Al-Baqarah 2:222], referring to menses – they should purify themselves by doing Ghusl after their menses ends .” (Al-Mulakhkhas Al-Fiqhi by Shaykh Salih Al-Fawzan (may Allah preserve him)\xa0\n\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/93027/what-makes-ghusl-obligatory
