476858,"My question is on family inheritance (a farmhouse with rented income) left by my paternal grandfather and grandmother who were blessed with 9 children, Their order of birth and number of their children (i.e. grandchildren) are defined below:","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe one who has the right to inherit from your grandfather is one who was alive at the time of your grandfather’s death. As for the one who died before your grandfather, he does not inherit, and his children are barred from inheriting by their paternal uncles.\nThe same applies to the estate of your grandmother; no one can inherit from her except those who were alive at the time when she died.\nIt says in al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (3/22): There are three conditions for inheriting:\n-1-\nAscertaining that the testator has indeed died or is legally presumed dead, as in the case of one who is missing, if the judge rules that he is to be presumed dead; or is expected to have died, as in the case of a foetus who is miscarried due to an attack on the mother for which the attacker is liable.\n-2-\nAscertaining that the heir was still alive after the death of the testator or he is deemed to still be alive, as in the case of a pregnancy in which the foetus was\xa0 delivered alive and remained stable up to the time when it was ascertained that he was alive at the time of the testator’s death.\n-3-\nKnowing the reason why someone is entitled to inheritance, such as being a spouse, blood relative or connected to the testator through wala’. The type of relationship should be known, such as being a child, father, mother, brother, or paternal uncle. And the degree of the relationship which connects the testator to the heir should be known. End quote.\nSee: adh-Dhakhirah by al-Qarafi (13/6); Mughni al-Muhtaj (4/10); Kashshaf al-Qina‘ (4/404).\nBased on that, the following do not inherit from your grandfather: the children of Aunty #3, because she died before her father.\nAnd the following do not inherit from your grandmother: the children of Aunty #3 and the children of Uncle #7, and you and your two sisters, because your fathers died before their mother.\nSecondly:\nThose who inherit from your grandfather are all of them except the children of Aunty #3.\nRegarding how his estate is to be divided, we may say:\nHe died and left behind a wife, three sons and five daughters.\nThe wife gets one eighth, and the rest is to be divided between the eight children, with each male getting the share of two females.\nIf any of them dies, his share passes to his children.\nSo when dividing the estate, it should be divided into 88 equal parts.\nThe share of the wife will be: the estate x 11 ÷ 88\nThe share of each male: the estate x 14 ÷ 88\nThe share of each female: the estate x 7 ÷ 88.\nThirdly:\nThose who inherit from your grandmother are the rest of her children except Aunty #3 and Uncle #7, and your father.\nThe way to divide her estate is as follows:\nShe died and left behind one son (Uncle #1) and five daughters.\nThe estate is to be divided between them, with the male getting the share of two females. So it should be divided into seven shares, of which the son gets two shares, which his children take, and each daughter gets one share.\nFourthly:\nIf all the heirs agreed not to divide the estate, there is nothing wrong with that, and in that case the income from the farm is to be divided among them according to the shares of inheritance, unless some of them forfeit their share and they are adults of sound mind, in which case there is nothing wrong with that.\nIf someone demands his share of the inheritance at any time, he has the right to do that. So he should either be given his share, or the others should buy it from him, giving him its price, or the farm may be sold and its price divided among them. It is not permissible to delay giving to the one who wants to take his share.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/476858/he-died-and-left-behind-a-wife-and-children-some-of-his-children-died-during-his-lifetime-and-some-died-before-his-wife-died-how-should-the-estate-of-the-spouses-be-divided
129409,Does laughing invalidate Wudu even though the person is not actually praying; rather he is getting ready to pray?,"['Praise be to Allah.Does laughing break Wudu?\nThere is no difference of opinion among the scholars that laughing outside of prayer – even when one is getting ready for prayer – does not invalidate Wudu.\nIbn Al-Mundhir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The scholars unanimously agreed that laughing outside of prayer does not invalidate Wudu and does not require one to do Wudu again.” (Al-Awsat, 1/166)\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “They [the scholars] unanimously agreed that laughing out loud outside of prayer does not invalidate Wudu.” (Al-Majmu`, 2/61)\nDoes laughing invalidate prayer?\nThe scholars unanimously agreed that laughing when praying invalidates the prayer .\nIbn Al-Mundhir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “They unanimously agreed that laughing when praying invalidates the prayer.” (Al-Ijma`, p. 3)\nWhat is meant by laughing here is laughing out loud\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “We do not know of any difference of opinion concerning that.” (Al-Mughni, 2/451)\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Laughing out loud, in which one makes a loud noise, is contrary to the dignity of prayer and to the focus and humility that is required in prayer. Moreover, it shows disrespect towards the prayer, makes a mockery of it and is contrary to its purpose, so the prayer is spoiled by that.” (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 22/617)\nDoes laughing out loud in prayer break your Wudu?\nFrom the above, it is clear that the difference of opinion among the scholars has to do with laughing out loud in the prayer and whether Wudu is also invalidated by it, or not.\nThe correct view, which is that of the majority of scholars, is that it does not invalidate Wudu, because there is no evidence to indicate that it does invalidate it.\nJabir ibn `Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “If someone laughs whilst praying, he must repeat his prayer, but he does not have to repeat Wudu”. (Narrated by Ad-Daraqutni, 51 and by Al-Bukhari in a Mu‘allaq report)\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “It is proven to be authentic, but it is the words of Jabir.” (Fat-h Al-Bari, 1/280)\nShaykh Al-Islam (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “There is no narration from any Companion to suggest a different view. Moreover, it does not invalidate Wudu outside of prayer, so by the same token [it does not invalidate Wudu] in the prayer.”(Sharh Al-`Umdah, 1/324)\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Our view and that of the majority of scholars is that it does not invalidate Wudu. … This is the view of the majority of the Tabi‘in and those who came after them.\nAl-Bayhaqi narrated that Abu Az-Zinad said: I met some of our well-versed scholars whose view is decisive: Sa‘id ibn Al-Musayyab, ‘Urwah ibn az-Zubayr, Al-Qasim ibn Muhammad, Abu Bakr ibn ‘Abd ar-Rahman, Kharijah ibn Zayd ibn Thabit, ‘Ubaydullah ibn ‘Abdillah ibn ‘Uqbah, Sulayman ibn Yasar, and many other respectable scholars, who say that laughing invalidates the prayer, but it does not invalidate Wudu.\nAnd he said: There is no proof at all to suggest that Wudu is invalidated by laughing.” (Al-Majmu`, 2/60)\nThe Hadiths which say that laughing invalidates Wudu are weak and none of them are sound.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “All of them are inauthentic and flimsy, according to the consensus of the scholars of Hadith.” (Al-Majmu`, (2/61)\nTo sum up, laughing does not invalidate Wudu, whether that happens when praying or outside of prayer.\nFor more details, please refer to the following answers: 755 , 87749 , 22170 .\nSee also these categories:\xa0\nThings Which Invalidate the Prayer\nNullifiers of Wudu\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/129409/does-laughing-break-wudu
486872,"What is the ruling on accepting change in a currency other than the one with which I paid when buying something? For example, I bought some batteries for $90; I give the seller $100 and he gave me back $10 in Turkish currency.","['Praise be to Allah.If you purchase something from a seller on the basis that the price is in dollars, for example, as mentioned in the question, and he owes you change, then there are two scenarios:\n-1-\nYou agree that he will give you the change in a different currency, as in your question. In this case, it is stipulated that it be done on the spot, so that you do not part before you settle what is outstanding between you [and you receive the full amount in the other currency].\nIbn al-Mundhir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: All of the scholars from whom I acquired knowledge are unanimously agreed that if the two parties who exchange currency for currency part before making the exchange, then the transaction is invalid.""(Al-Ishraf ‘ala Madhahib al-‘Ulama’\xa06/61).\nIbn ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Ahmad ibn Hanbal used to say: He may accept dinars (gold coins) for dirhams (silver coins) and dirhams for dinars, whether it is a loan or otherwise, based on the current exchange rate.""(At-Tamhid\xa0 10/52).\nAl-Khattabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is stipulated that they should not part with anything outstanding between them, because receiving payment in dirhams for a loan in dinars is an exchange, and an exchange transaction is not valid unless it is done on the spot.""(Ma‘alim as-Sunan\xa0 3/74).\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If a man agrees to give one dinar in exchange for ten dirhams, but the other man only has five dirhams with him, it is not permissible for them to part until he has received all ten dirhams. If he accepts the five and they part, the transaction is invalid for half of the dinar. But is it also invalid with regard to the five dirhams that he received? There are two scenarios, depending on how they agreed to conclude the deal.""(Al-Mughni\xa0 6/114).\n-2-\nHe does not have any change (smaller bills or coins), whether in dollars or any other currency. In that case it is permissible for you to leave what remains due to you from the hundred dollars as a trust with him, on condition that what he owes you is still ten dollars and not its equivalent in any other currency.\nThen when you come to collect it from him, you may agree that he should pay you in the same currency (dollars) or in another currency, which you agree upon at that time. In that case, the exchange rate – when he gives you what he owes you of dollars in Turkish liras or any other currency – will be the rate at the time of payment, and you should not reach an agreement on the exchange rate at the time when you entrust it to him and leave it with him, so that it does not become an exchange of one currency for another with a delay in receipt of the money, which is prohibited.\nIbn Qudamah said, completing what is mentioned above, after discussing the invalidity of the exchange between both of them:\nIf they want to settle the matter, then they should nullify the exchange deal with regard to the other half for which he does not have money to pay it, or they can annul the entire deal, then he can buy half a dinar from him for five dirhams and give that to him, and take the entire dinar. Thus what he bought from him belongs to him, and the rest is a trust under his care, then they may part. Then later on, if he wants to give him the remainder of what he owes him for the dinar, or buy something from him with what remains of it, or make it a payment for a salam transaction [paying for something in advance to be delivered later on], or give it to him, it is permissible for him to do that. The same applies if he wants to appoint him as his proxy to do something with it.\nIf he buys silver for one and a half dinars, and gives the seller two dinars and says to him: I appoint you as my proxy to dispose of the extra half dinar, that is valid.\nIf he exchanges ten dirhams for one dinar, then gives him more than a dinar, to weigh for him what he owes at some other time, that is permissible, even if a long time elapses, and the additional amount is a trust which is under his care; he is not liable if it is lost or damaged. Ahmad discussed most of these issues.\nIf one of them only has five dirhams and he buys half a dinar with it, but receives an entire dinar, and he gives him the five dirhams then borrows them back from him, and uses them to buy the other half of the dinar, or he buys the whole dinar from him for ten dirhams from the outset, and he gives him five dirhams, then he borrows them back from him and pays them to him for the other half, not by way of trickery, there is nothing wrong with that.""(Al-Mughni\xa0 6/114).\nAl-Bahuti (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If he buys silver for one and a half dinars and the purchaser gives the seller two dinars to take what he is owed from that, so the seller takes what he is owed from the two dinars, even after they part, then the exchange is valid, because it took place on the spot before parting, and what is delayed is separating what is his from what belongs to the other one. The extra amount left over from the two dinars is a trust under the seller’s care, because there is nothing to indicate that he is liable for it.\nIf he offers him five dirhams in exchange for half a dinar, then he gives him a dinar to take half from it, the exchange is valid, because the exchange has taken place on the spot, even if separating what is his from what is owed to the buyer is delayed until after they part, as half of it is for him and the rest of the dinar is a trust under his care, meaning that it is under the care of the one who took the dinar, because of what we have noted above. Thus they may part before the dinar is split. Then if the one who took the dinar completes the exchange by returning to him what he owes him of the dinar, that is permissible. Or if he purchases something from him with the rest of the dinar, that is permissible; if he makes it a payment for something to be delivered later on (salam transaction), that is permissible, because it is his money and is not a debt. Or if he gives it to him as a gift, meaning that the one who gave the dinar gives the rest of it to the one who took it, that is permissible because the owner of the dinar has disposed of what is left of it in an appropriate manner.\nEnd quote from Kashshaf al-Qina‘ (8/46). See also: Masa’il al-Imam Ahmad by Abu’l-Fadl Salih (3/234).\nBased on that, if you gave the other person $100 so that he could take $90 from it as the price for the goods and give the rest back to you in Turkish currency, there is nothing wrong with that, so long as it was done on the spot [before parting].\nIf he does not have any change, then you may leave the $10 with him as a trust, then when you want to ask him to give it back to you, he may either give you $10 or give you the equivalent in another currency.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/486872/what-is-the-ruling-on-accepting-change-in-a-different-currency-when-buying-something
100009,I have friends who stay in the masjid after Fajr prayer to mention Allah individually. Others sit in a group and recite the Quran together in the same masjid. What is your opinion about this? Is it better to read the Adhkar of day and night in the masjid or at home?,"['Praise be to Allah.Virtues of staying in the mosque after Fajr\nIt is recommended to stay in the mosque after Fajr prayer until the sun rises, because this is what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his companions did, and because there is great reward in that. Muslim (670) narrated from Jabir ibn Samurah (may Allah be pleased with him) that when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had prayed Fajr, he would sit in his prayer place until the sun had risen properly.\xa0\nMuslim also narrated (670) that Sammak ibn Harb (may Allah have mercy on him) said: I said to Jabir ibn Samurah: Did you sit with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)? He said: Yes, frequently. He would not get up from the place in which he had prayed Fajr until the sun had risen, and when the sun had risen he would get up. They used to chat and talk about matters of the Jahiliyyah (the pre-Islamic period), and they would laugh but he smiled.\xa0\nAt-Tirmidhi narrated that Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever prays Fajr in congregation then sits remembering Allah until the sun rises, then prays two rak’ahs, will have a reward like that of Hajj and ‘Umrah .” He said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “In full, in full, in full.” \xa0\nThis Hadith was classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Tirmidhi.\xa0\nThis points to the virtue of sitting in the mosque after Fajr prayer, and the virtue of praying two Rak`ahs when the sun has risen fully.\xa0\nIn general, if a person stays in the mosque to remember Allah (Dhikr) and worship Him, or waiting for the prayer, all of these are good deeds and acts of worship that bring one closer to Allah. Al-Bukhari (445) and Muslim (649) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The angels send blessings upon one of you so long as he is in his prayer-place where he offered his prayer, so long as he does not break his wudu; they say: ‘O Allah forgive him, O Allah have mercy on him.’”\xa0\nBased on this, your brothers have done well by staying in the mosque to remember Allah, and we ask Allah to reward them.\xa0\nReading Quran in unison\nReading the Quran together in unison is not prescribed, because it is not mentioned in the Sunnah. And if it is done in a loud voice that disturbs those who are remembering Allah and sitting there, then it is even more disliked, because of the general meaning of the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “When one of you stands in prayer, he is conversing with his Lord, so let one of you know what he is saying to his Lord and do not raise your voices above one another in reciting when praying.” (Narrated by Ahmad, 4928 and classed as authentic by Shu’ayb Al-Arna’ut in Tahqiq Al-Musnad).\xa0\nIt says in Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah (4/112): What is the ruling on reciting Quran together in the mosque?\xa0\nAnswer:\xa0\n“The question is somewhat vague. If what is meant is that they recite together in unison, pausing and stopping at the same time, this is not prescribed, and at the very least it is makruh, because there is no report from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) or from the Companions that they did that. But if that is done for the purpose of teaching, then we hope that there is nothing wrong with it. But if what is meant is that they gather to read Quran in order to memorize it or learn it, and one of them reads whilst the others listen, or each of them reads to himself without raising his voice or reading in unison with others, then that is prescribed, because it is proven that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No people gather in one of the houses of Allah, reciting the Book of Allah and studying it together, but sakinah (tranquility) descends upon them and the angels surround them and mercy covers them, and Allah remembers them to those who are with Him.” (Narrated by Muslim)”\xa0\nIt also says (4/39): \xa0\n|”Question:\xa0\nIs it permissible to recite Surat Ya-Sin out loud in the mosque or not?\xa0\nAnswer:\xa0\nIt is not permissible for anyone to raise his voice when reciting Qur’an in the mosque, whether it is Soorat Ya-Seen or any other surah of the Quran, whether in prayer or otherwise, because it is proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came out to the people when they were praying and reciting Quran out loud, and he said: “O people, each of you is conversing with his Lord, so do not raise your voices above one another in reciting.” And because by doing that they distract and disturb one another.”\xa0\nThese readers should be advised and called in a gentle manner.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/100009/virtues-of-staying-in-the-mosque-after-fajr
