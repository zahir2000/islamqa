489220,"I am divorced and I have two daughters. I take some of my daughters’ maintenance money every month for my medical treatment, because I am sick. With regard to my daughters’ food and drink, it is my father who is sponsoring that. What is the ruling on my taking some of my daughters’ money every month? Please note that I have no other option except to do that.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe basic principle is that the mother who has custody of her children does not have the right to take anything from her children’s maintenance money in return for taking care of them; rather she is entrusted with the money that is sent for her children’s maintenance and is expected to dispose of it according to what is in their best interests.\nAd-Dardir al-Maliki (may Allah have mercy on him) said: She does not have the right to spend any of her child’s maintenance money on herself in return for taking care of the child. End quote from Bulghat as-Salik li Aqrab al-Masalik (2/765).\nSecondly:\nIt is permissible for the father and mother to take from their children’s wealth for their needs, so long as it does not harm the children.\nIt was narrated from ‘A’ishah, from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), that he said: “A man’s son is part of his earnings, among the best of his earnings, so you may take from their wealth.” Narrated by Abu Dawud (3529); classed as sahih by al-Albani.\nIbn al-Amir as-San‘ani (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is soundly narrated from Abu’z-Zubayr that he heard Jabir ibn ‘Abdillah say: The father and mother may take from their child’s wealth without his permission.\nEnd quote from Risalah Latifah fi Sharh Hadith Anta wa Maluka li Abik (p. 24). The report was narrated by Ibn Hazm in al-Muhalla with his isnad (6/385).\nIt was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Your children are a gift from Allah to you, {He gives to whom He wills female [children], and He gives to whom He wills males} [al-Shoora 42:49]. They and their wealth are yours if you need it.” Narrated by al-Hakim in al-Mustadrak (3123), who said: It is sahih according to the conditions of al-Bukhari and Muslim. Also narrated by al-Bayhaqi in al-Kubra (15745). Classed as sahih by al-Albani in as-Silsilah as-Sahihah (2564). See the commentary of Shu‘ayb al-Arna’ut et al. on Sunan Ibn Majah, hadith no. 2137.\nAs-Sawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said, explaining that it is permissible for the mother to take from her child’s wealth, if she is in difficulty, and she does not regard it as being in return for looking after the child:\nShe does not have the right to spend on herself in return for looking after the child.\nBut if it is for another reason – meaning that she takes it for a reason other than looking after the child – and is in difficulty, then she may spend on herself from the child’s wealth, whether what she takes is less than the going rate for looking after the child or more than that, because she is entitled to maintenance even if she does not look after the child.\nEnd quote from Hashiyat as-Sawi ‘ala ash-Sharh as-Saghir (2/765).\nShaykh Salih al-Fawzan (may Allah preserve him) said: The father has the right to take from his child’s wealth so long as it will not harm the child or take what the child needs, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The best of what you consume is your earnings, and your children are among your earnings.” And he said: “You and your wealth belong to your father.” This undoubtedly refers to the father’s rights, but it also includes the mother’s rights, because she is like the father according to the correct view. So she may take from her child’s wealth that which will benefit her and meet her needs, so long as that will not be detrimental to the child and what she takes is not needed by him.\nEnd quote from al-Muntaqa min Fatawa al-Fawzan.\nBased on the above:\nIt is permissible for you to take from your children’s wealth to pay for medical treatment, on condition that that will not harm the children. In other words, that should only be after ensuring that the children have enough.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/489220/is-it-permissible-for-the-mother-to-take-some-of-the-wealth-of-her-children-who-are-in-her-custody
325773,Is memorizing hadith in Arabic the same as memorizing the translation of the hadith in any other language?,"['Praise be to Allah.With regard to memorizing and learning the Prophet’s Sunnah, undoubtedly the basic principle is that all of that – for the one who is able – should be done in Arabic, the language in which the revelation came, and in which the hadiths were narrated in the books of Sunnah. This is better than memorizing the meanings translated into other languages, for two important reasons:\nThe first reason is:\nArabic is one of the symbols of Islam, and it is the language that was chosen by Allah, may He be exalted, to transmit the message of Islam. Whenever the Muslim is able to learn his religion in this language, he should not turn to any other language. This was the view of the righteous early generations.\nAsh-Shafa‘i (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nEvery Muslim must learn as much of the language of the Arabs as he is able to so that he can testify in Arabic that La ilaha illa Allah wa Muhammad ‘abduhu wa rasuluhu (there is no god worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad is His slave and His Messenger), and he can recite the Book of Allah in Arabic, and recite the words of dhikr that he is enjoined to recite, such as takbir, tasbih and the tashahhud, and so on.\nThe more knowledge he can learn in the language which Allah made the language of the last of His Prophets and in which He revealed the last of His Books, the better it will be for him. End quote from ar-Risalah (p. 48-49).\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAsh-Shafa‘i said: … The language which Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, chose was the language of the Arabs, in which He sent down His holy Book, and He made it the language of the last of His Prophets, Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nHence we say: everyone who is able to learn Arabic should learn it, because it is the foremost language that one should strive to learn, without forbidding anyone to speak a non-Arabic language.\nAsh-Shafa‘i regarded it as disliked for one who knows Arabic to give names in any other language, or to speak it mixed with foreign words. What the leading scholars said concerning this issue was narrated from the Sahabah and Tabi‘in. End quote from Iqtida’ as-Sirat al-Mustaqim (1/521-522).\nThe second reason is:\nTranslated hadiths are translations of the meanings, and there are a number of hadiths in which the words are to be pronounced as they are in Arabic, so the one who memorizes them should pay attention to their pronunciation in Arabic as much as he is able, such as the hadiths which mention adhkar. This is indicated by the hadith of al-Bara’ ibn ‘Azib, who said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said:\n“When you go to your bed, do wudu’ as for prayer, then lie down on your right side and say:\xa0\nAllahumma aslamtu wajhi ilayka wa fawwadtu amri ilayka wa alja’tu zahri ilayka raghbatan wa rahbatan ilayka, la malja’a wa laa manjaa minka illa ilayka. Allahumma amantu bi kitabika alladhi anzalta wa nabiyyika alladhi arsalta (O Allah I submit my face to You, and I entrust my affairs to You, and I rely totally on You in hope and in fear of You. Verily there is no refuge nor safe haven from You except with You. O Allah, I believe in Your Book which You have revealed and in Your Prophet whom You have sent). \xa0\nThen if you die during the night, you will have died following the fitrah (sound nature of man). Make these the last words that you speak.”\xa0\nHe said: I repeated it back to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and when I reached the words. “Allahumma aamantu bi kitaabika alladhi anzalta (O Allah, I believe in Your Book which You have revealed),” I said: “Wa rasulika (And Your Messenger).” He said: “No. Wa nabiyyika alladhi arsalta (and Your Prophet whom You sent).”\nNarrated by al-Bukhari (247) and Muslim (2710).\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe most appropriate thing that can be said regarding the reason why the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) corrected the one who said “rasul (messenger)” instead of “nabi (prophet)” is that the wording of adhkar is tawqifi [i.e., they can only be known through divine Revelation and sound texts of hadith, with no room for ijtihad or alteration]. They must be recited as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) recited them, because that pronunciation has special effects and benefits, and they should not be altered. Therefore they must be recited with the same pronunciation that was narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). This is the view favoured by al-Maziri… End quote from Fath al-Bari (11/112).\nWith regard to other hadiths, in many cases there is a difference of scholarly opinion regarding their interpretation, so a translation will be based on the meaning favoured by the translator, or on what he understood, which may based on a weaker scholarly view, or it may be based on his own understanding which is incorrect, or it may be incorrectly expressed in the language into which it is translated.\nIn some hadiths, the Arabic wording may indicate a number of meanings, some of which are lost in translation, so the one who reads the translation understands only one meaning, and if the translator aimed to encompass all the meanings that are contained in the hadith, the translation would be so long that the one who wants to memorize it would tire of it.\nBut for the one who is not able to learn Arabic or memorize in Arabic, so he memorizes in his own language, he is still doing well. All that he is lacking is the pronunciation in Arabic, but if understands the meaning, this is beneficial knowledge that he has acquired, even if that has to do with adhkar, supplications (du‘a’s), ruqyah and the like. So there is nothing wrong with him offering supplication in translation, and remembering Allah in his language that he is able to speak.\nFor more information, see the answers to questions no. 262254 and 318586 .\nConclusion:\nThe one who is able to learn Arabic should study the Prophet’s Sunnah and memorize it in Arabic, with the pronunciation narrated in the books of Sunnah, because Arabic is a symbol of Islam and is the language in which the revelation came.\nMemorizing in Arabic means memorizing the pronunciation, and in some cases the pronunciation is essential and required, such as adhkar. That will also preserve the full meanings, some of which may be lost in translation.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/325773/is-memorizing-hadith-in-translation-like-memorizing-it-in-arabic
105280,Is it true that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade travelling alone?,"['Praise be to Allah.Can a man travel alone in Islam?\nYes, it is proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade that in several Hadiths, including the following:\xa0\nIbn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If people knew what I know about being alone, no rider would travel at night by himself.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 2998)\xa0\nImam Ahmad narrated this Hadith in Al-Musnad (2/91) with some additional material in which it says:\xa0\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade being alone, for a man to spend the night alone or travel alone .\xa0\nBut this report is regarded as odd (i.e., inauthentic), and it is superseded by the report of Al-Bukhari for two reasons:\xa0\n\nThe report of Al-Bukhari was narrated by nine of the companions of `Asim ibn Muhammad ibn Zayd ibn `Abdullah ibn `Umar from his father from Ibn `Umar, all of whom mention travelling only and not spending the night. Only one of the students of `Asim ibn Muhammad, namely `Abd Al-Wahid ibn Wasil, mentioned the prohibition on spending the night alone. Although he was trustworthy, the report narrated by many trustworthy narrators supersedes his report.\nThis is indicated by a similar report from Ahmad, although the narrator does not mention the specific wording of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), unlike the report of the majority.\n\nHence the editors of Musnad Ahmad (9/467), and Shaykh Muqbil Al-Wadi`i in Ahadith Mu`allah (249), ruled that the report of `Abd Al-Wahid is odd, unlike Shaykh Al-Albani who ruled that it is authentic, as stated in As-Silsilah As-Sahihah (60).\xa0\nThe prohibition on spending the night alone was narrated in a Mursal report from `Ata’, as was narrated by Abu Dawud in Kitab Al-Marasil (380) and Ibn Abu Shaybah in Al-Musannaf (7/726).\xa0\nAl-Tabarani narrated in Al-Awsat (2079) via Muhammad ibn Al-Qasim Al-Asadi from Zuhayr ibn Mu`awiyah from Abu Az-Zubayr from Jabir that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If people knew what I know about being alone, no rider would travel at night by himself and no man would sleep in a house by himself.” \xa0\nBut this report is to be rejected because of Muhammad ibn Al-Qasim Al-Asadi, because he was accused of lying.\xa0\nThe prohibition on spending the night alone was also narrated in some authentic reports. It was narrated that `Umar ibn Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) said: No man should travel alone or sleep in a house on his own.” (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in As-Silsilah As-Sahihah, 1/130).\xa0\nImam Ahmad was asked about a man spending the night alone. He said: “I prefer him to avoid that.” (Al-Adab Ash-Shar`iyyah (1/428)\xa0\n\nIt was narrated from `Abdullah ibn `Amr ibn Al-`Aas that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The (lone) rider is a devil, two riders are two devils and three are a travelling party.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 1674; he said it is a sound Hadith). It was also classified as sound by Ibn Hajar in Fath Al-Bari (6/53) and by Al-Albani in As-Silsilah As-Sahihah (62).\xa0\n\nThese Hadiths indicate that it is disliked to be alone in situations where a man fears for himself because of weakness, severe exhaustion or hardship, or when he fears that the Shaytan may tempt him and mislead him. The benefit of being with righteous companions is not limited to help and support, rather the most important thing is that it helps him to remain steadfast and pious, for the shaytaan is further away from two.\xa0\nAl-Hafidh Ibn Hajar said in Fat-h Al-Bari (6/53):\xa0\n“Ibn Khuzaymah reported it under the heading; “the prohibition on two travelling and that less than three are sinners,” because what is meant by “devil” is a sinner. At-Tabari said: This is a rebuke aimed at disciplining and guiding because of the fear of loneliness for one, but it is not prohibited. The one who travels alone in the wilderness and the one who stays alone in a house has no guarantee that he will not feel lonely, especially if he had bad thoughts and is weak in faith.\xa0\nIn fact people differ with regard to that and the prohibition concerning that is a measure of protection, but if there is need for that, it should be fine. It was said, commenting on the words “the (lone) rider is a devil” that his travelling alone is suggested to him by the shaytaan, or he is likened to the shaytaan in his actions. And it was said that it is disliked because if the person who is travelling alone dies on the journey, there will be no one who can take care of him; similarly, if two are travelling and both or one die, there will be no one to help, unlike three, because in most cases that fear will not be present.”\nWhen can man travel alone in Islam?\nThe apparent meaning of the Hadith is that the prohibition applies to the one who travels alone via empty and remote routes. As for well-travelled routes, and those in which there is no risk of being lost, and where there are likely to be helpers and companions, there is no report that it is makruh or prohibited.\xa0\nThe same applies to travelling nowadays on planes, ships and buses, because those who are in them are all regarded as travelling companions, so the one who travels by these means is not alone in the sense that is forbidden.\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin said in Fatawa Nur `ala Al-Darb (mutafarraqat/Al-adab):\xa0\n“This points to the warning against travelling alone, but that applies to journeys where the route is not travelled by many. As for journeys where the route is travelled by many, and it is as if one is in the middle of a village, such as the route from Al-Qaseem to Riyadh, or Riyadh to Dammam and other such routes where there are many travellers, and the road to the Hijaz during the Hajj season, this is not in fact regarded as being alone, because many people travel by these routes. So a person may be alone in his car but he is not alone on the journey, rather there are people around him, behind him and in front of him at every moment.”\xa0\nShaykh Al-Albani said in his commentary on this Hadith in As-Sahihah (62):\xa0\n“Perhaps the Hadith refers to travelling in the deserts or wilderness where the traveller rarely sees anyone. It does not include travel nowadays on paved and well-travelled roads. And Allah knows best.”\xa0\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 122630 , 4523 , 34380 , and 47029 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/105280/are-men-allowed-to-travel-alone-in-islam
