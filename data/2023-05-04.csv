309498,"Yesterday I decided to make up a missed fast, because it was getting very late. But my intention at night was that if I got up and ate sahur, I would fast. But then I fell asleep and I got up for Fajr prayer [after dawn had broken] and I did not eat sahur. Do I have to refrain from eating and drinking? Is it permissible for me not to fast? Is my making up the fast regarded as valid, if I refrain from eating and drinking, because I restricted my intention by stipulating a condition that I would eat sahur?","['Praise be to Allah.Obligation of forming the intention the night before observing an obligatory fast\nIt is obligatory to form the intention the night before for every obligatory fast, which includes making up missed Ramadan fasts, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever did not intend to fast before dawn, there is no fast for him.” Narrated by Abu Dawud (2454), at-Tirmidhi (730) and an-Nasa’i (2331). According to the version narrated by an-Nasa’i: “Whoever does not form the intention to fast at night, before dawn, there is no fast for him.” This hadith was classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud.\nAt-Tirmidhi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: What this means, according to some of the scholars, is that there is no [valid] fast for the one who does not form the intention to fast before dawn breaks, in Ramadan, or when making up a missed Ramadan fast, or when fasting in fulfilment of a vow, because if he does not form the intention from the night before, it is not valid [as an obligatory fast].\nIn the case of voluntary fasts, on the other hand, it is permissible to form the intention to fast after dawn has broken. This is the view of ash-Shafa‘i, Ahmad and Ishaq. End quote.\nThe view of Abu Hanifah (may Allah have mercy on him) is that the fast is valid if the intention is formed on the same day.\nIbn Qudamah said: If it is an obligatory fast – such as fasting in Ramadan, in the month itself or making up a missed Ramadan fast, or fasting in fulfilment of a vow or as an act of expiation – it is stipulated that the intention should be formed the night before, according to our imam, and Malik, and ash-Shafa‘i.\nAbu Hanifah said: In the case of a Ramadan fast and any fast that one is obliged to do, it is acceptable to form the intention on the same day.""(Al-Mughni\xa0 3/109).\nIs it valid to observe a make-up fast with an uncertain intention?\nIf your intention was that if you got up and ate sahur, then you would fast, this is an uncertain intention, with which the fast is not valid [as an obligatory fast].\nIt says in al-Furu‘ (4/459): According to our madhhab, if a person is uncertain about not fasting, or he intends that he will break his fast at a particular time, or that if he finds food he will eat, otherwise he will continue his fast, then by analogy with the difference of opinion regarding prayer, it was said that this renders the fast invalid, because his intention was not firm. Hence it is not valid to start fasting with such an [uncertain] intention. End quote.\nSome of the jurists regarded the fast of one who says, “If tomorrow is Ramadan, then I will fast” as valid, because he does not know whether tomorrow will be Ramadan, so his hesitation is based on uncertainty as to whether it will be proven that the month has begun, not on uncertainty in his intention as to whether he will fast or not. Hence if one for whom it is permissible not to fast says on some night in Ramadan: “Tomorrow maybe I will fast and maybe I will not fast,” then he decides after dawn has broken that he will fast, his fast is not valid because of the uncertainty in his intention.""(Ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘\xa0 6/362).\nBased on that, if you got up before the adhan of Fajr and formed the intention to fast, your fast is valid.\nIf you got up after the adhan, then your fast is not valid as a make-up fast, because your intention was conditional and was not firm.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/309498/she-intended-that-if-she-got-up-and-ate-sahur-then-she-would-fast-to-make-up-a-missed-ramadan-fast-but-then-she-got-up-after-dawn-had-broken-is-her-fast-valid
258447,"My brother bought a used car, and he kept it for more than two years, driving it and travelling in it, and nothing happened to it during this time. More than two months ago, my brother sold this car “as is”, after a mechanic brought by the purchaser had checked it, and after it had passed the roadworthiness test that is compulsory before selling a car here in Morocco. Now the purchaser of the car has got in touch with my brother and told him that the car has a defective, namely that the roof has been replaced, which means that it was probably involved in an accident. My brother is now confused: is there any sin on him? Is this sale regarded as valid according to Islamic teachings? Does my brother have to compensate the purchaser for this defect? Please note that he sold his car because he needed the money.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIf someone buys a car then discovers a defective in it, and it is the type of defective that could detract from its value, then he has the choice between returning it or keeping it and receiving compensation from the seller for this defective. The scholars call this compensation an indemnity.\nIt says in Kashshaf al-Qina‘ (3/218): If someone buys a defective product and was not aware of it at the time of the purchase, then he has the choice, regardless of whether the seller was aware of the defective and concealed it from the purchaser, or he was not aware of the defective. …\nThe purchaser has the choice between returning it, so as to make up for what he has lost and to alleviate any harm that may affect him if he keeps it, as a result of the reduction in the value of the item…\nOr, if he returns it, he should receive the price in full, because by cancelling the deal, the purchaser is entitled to take back the price in full. …\nOr he may keep the item, and receive compensation for the defective, even if it is possible to return it, whether the seller likes it or not, because the two parties agreed to the deal on the basis that the payment was in return for the item, and each part of the item could be valued in monetary terms, but when there is a defective, it is as if part of the item is missing, so he has the right to receive money instead, and this is the indemnity (compensation). End quote.\nThus it is known that the option to return the defective item is established, regardless of whether the seller was aware of the defective or not, and regardless of whether the purchaser examined the item or not. Once the defective is discovered, he has the option [of cancelling the deal].\nIf your brother was not aware of the defective, then there is no sin on him, but the purchaser has the choice between returning the car or keeping it and receiving compensation.\nThe compensation is the difference between the value of the defective car and its value if it was in sound condition; this amount is to be deducted from the price.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said, explaining that:\nThe word indemnity (or compensation) refers to the difference between the value of the item in sound condition and the value of the defective item.\nHe said value, and he did not say price, because there is a difference between the value and the price, which is: the value is the market price of the item, and the price is what is agreed to in the transaction.\nSo if you buy something for six that is worth eight, then its value is eight and its price is six …\nHence he said: The difference between the value of the item in sound condition and the defective item is that the item is to be evaluated when it is in sound condition, then it should be evaluated when it is defective, and the difference between the two should be worked out. That is the indemnity (compensation) that should be deducted from the price.\nThe evaluation should be done at the time of making the deal, not at the time when the defective is discovered, because the value may vary between the time when the deal is made and the time when the defective is discovered.""(Ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘\xa0 8/318).\nSo your brother has to go back to the one from whom he bought the car in the first place, and ask him for compensation for the defective.\nSecondly:\nWhat is mentioned above, that the purchaser is the one who is to make the decision, and that he has the right to keep the car and ask for compensation, is the view of the majority of scholars.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) was of the view that there is no option of receiving compensation; rather the purchaser may either return the item or keep it without compensation, and there can be no compensation except with the consent of the seller.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The words “or he may return it and take back the price” mean: you have the right to return the item, cancel the deal and take back the price. So the purchaser has the option [of cancelling the deal]. This is the view of the jurists (may Allah have mercy on them).\nBut Shaykh al-Islam said: Either he may keep it without compensation, or he may return it. As for compensation, the consent of the seller is essential, because it is a transaction.\nSo the seller may say: I sold this thing to you; either keep it or return it. As for compensation, this is regarded as a new transaction.\nThe shaykh’s view has merit, but if we know that the seller is a cheat – meaning that he was aware of the defective but concealed it – then in this case the choice is between keeping the item and receiving compensation, or returning it.\nThis ruling is applicable in the case of concealing defects and in the case of charging too much for the item.""(Ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘\xa0\xa08/319).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/258447/he-bought-a-car-after-checking-it-then-he-found-a-defective-of-which-the-seller-was-not-aware-does-he-have-the-option-to-cancel-the-deal
