136609,"I needed money, so I borrowed some gold from my wife, and we agreed that I should pay her back in gold. After two years, the price of gold rose unbelievably, and is now double. I have no choice but to pay double the price of the gold that I borrowed in the beginning. Is this increase regarded as riba?","['Praise be to Allah.If someone burrows gold, then he must pay back in gold of the same weight, and the difference in value of the gold makes no difference. The increase in its value is not regarded as riba at all.\nIt is permissible for you to give cash instead of gold, but that is on condition that it be equivalent to the price of gold on the day of paying off the debt, and you should pay the price in full, and not leave anything of what you owe outstanding.\nThe scholars of the Permanent Committee said:\nLoans must be paid off in the same type of wealth, and this is what fairness dictates. The rise and fall in value is something that may benefit or harm either party. Fluctuation in prices happened at the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), but the basic Islamic principle that was ordained for the Muslims was not changed because of that, and they are to handle their affairs in the light of that ruling.\nThe borrower may return the value of the loan at the time of paying off his debt, if the lender agrees to that, because it is soundly narrated from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: We used to sell camels for dinars and accept dirhams, and we used to sell them for dirhams and accept dinars. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There is nothing wrong with you accepting them at that day’s price, so long as you do not part with any outstanding business remaining between you.”(Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah\xa013/275).\nThey also said:\nThere is nothing wrong with borrowing gold then returning the equivalent amount, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Gold for gold, weight for weight, like for like.” Similarly, he may return its value at the current price, hand to hand.""(Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah\xa0 14/113).\nConclusion: what you must do is return the gold as you took it, by weight, and the increase in its price is not regarded as riba.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/136609/he-borrowed-some-gold-from-his-wife-and-when-the-time-came-to-pay-her-back-the-price-of-gold-had-risen-does-this-come-under-the-heading-of-riba
400548,"I have a question about Hajj. If someone who is a resident of Makkah did Hajj ifrad [i.e., Hajj on its own, without ‘umrah], and after stoning Jamrat al-‘Aqabah he did tawaf al-ifadah and did not do sa‘i, because he thought that residents of Makkah do not have to do sa‘i , then he exited ihram completely and had intercourse with his wife, should he have done sa‘i, or is it indeed the case that the residents of Makkah do not have to do sa‘i? If he should have done sa‘i, and there is no difference between the residents of Makkah and others, then what is the expiation for that? How can he make up for the shortcoming in his Hajj? Please note that he did ‘umrah after that, and did another Hajj. With regard to his having had intercourse with his wife, does the fact that he did tawaf al-ifadah only, and not sa‘i, and that was after stoning Jamrat al-‘Aqabah, mean that he is regarded as having exited ihram completely, or must sa‘i be done with tawaf in order to exit ihram? Does he have to offer any kaffarah (expiation) or fidyah (ransom)?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe pilgrim (whether he is doing ifrad, qiran or tamattu‘) must do sa‘i, going back and forth between as-Safa and al-Marwah. That is one of the pillars or essential parts of Hajj, without which it is not complete. There is no differentiation in that regard between the residents of Makkah and others.\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: We are residents of Makkah. I did Hajj last year; I did tawaf but I did not do sa‘i. What is the ruling on that?\nHe replied: You must do sa‘i. What you did was wrong, because sa‘i is essential, whether you are one of the residents of Makkah or not. It is essential to do sa‘i after tawaf. After coming down from ‘Arafah, you must do tawaf and sa‘i, and the one who failed to do sa‘i must do it now.""(Fatawa ash-Shaykh Ibn Baz\xa0 17/341).\nSecondly:\nWith regard to exiting ihram completely, that can only be achieved by doing tawaf and sa‘i. So if someone did tawaf but did not do sa‘i, he has not exited ihram completely, so what he must do is refrain from having intercourse with his wife.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The second stage of exiting ihram cannot be regarded as complete until after doing tawaf al-ifadah and sa‘i, whether the pilgrim is doing tamattu‘ or qiran or ifrad, if he did not do sa‘i when he did the tawaf of arrival.""(Fatawa Arkan al-Islam\xa0p. 541).\nIf he thinks that he exited ihram and had intercourse with his wife, then we hope that he will be excused because of his being unaware of the ruling, and he does not have to do anything else. But if he is able to slaughter a sheep and distribute its meat to the poor of the Haram, that will be more prudent and more appropriate.\nPlease see the answer to question no. 104178 .\nThirdly:\nIf someone still owes the sa‘i of Hajj then enters ihram for ‘umrah, this ihram for ‘umrah is invalid, because he is still in a state of ihram for Hajj. So the sa‘i that he did thinking that it was for ‘umrah counts for his Hajj, and by doing it he has completed his Hajj.\nAd-Dardir said in ash-Sharh al-Kabir (2/27): The actions that he did as ‘umrah, become invalidated if that follows Hajj, because ‘umrah is of a lower status and Hajj is of a higher status. End quote.\nWe asked Shaykh ‘Abd ar-Rahman al-Barrak (may Allah preserve him) about a woman who did ‘umrah and forgot to cut her hair, then she went and entered ihram for another ‘umrah, and she did tawaf and sa‘i, then cut her hair.\nHe replied: Doing one ‘umrah after another is something that is not known to the jurists of the Muslims. Therefore the second ‘umrah is invalid, and her cutting her hair counts for the first ‘umrah. End quote.\nThe fact that he intended this sa‘i to be for ‘umrah and not for Hajj does not matter, because the correct scholarly view is that it is sufficient to have the intention of doing sa‘i, and it is not stipulated that it should be intended specifically for Hajj.\nSee: ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘ (7/403).\nSee also the answer to question no. 280967 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/400548/he-did-not-do-sai-for-hajj-then-he-did-umrah-after-that-is-his-hajj-complete
376636,"I have plans to do Hajj in the future. I have a problem, my feet are flat. I cannot walk without orthopedic insoles. How can I do the Tawaf? What can you advise and suggest to me? What are all the solutions allowed ? For example, new sandal(or new shoes...) with othopedic insoles only to use in interior of the masjeed/mosque (and to walk at Mina-safa... ) or sock with orthopedic soles, etc .....?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt is haram for the pilgrim in ihram for Hajj or ‘umrah to wear khuffs or anything that covers the ankles, such as socks, some kinds of athletic shoes, and so on. But there is nothing wrong with wearing flip-flops, sandals or shoes that come below the ankles.\nThe basic principle regarding that is the report narrated by al-Bukhari from ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: A man stood up and said: O Messenger of Allah, what clothes do you instruct us to wear in ihram? The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: <<Do not wear a chemise or trousers or turban or burnoose; and if someone does not have shoes, let him wear khuffs and cut them so that they come lower than the ankles. And do not wear anything that has been dyed with saffron or wars (a yellow plant dye), and the woman in ihram should not wear a face veil or gloves.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Sharh al-‘Umdah (3/35): Once he has cut down the khuffs they become like shoes and once he has torn the seam of trousers they become like an izar (waist-wrapper or lower garment), then they can no longer be called khuffs or trousers. Hence when it is said: Wipe over the khuffs, and it is permissible to wipe over the khuffs, and he instructed us not to take off our khuffs, this does not include those that are cut or sandals. It is not known in regular linguistic usage that what has been cut down, or sandals and the like, can be called khuffs.\nHence it says in the hadith: “Let him put them on and cut them until they come lower than the ankles.” He called them khuffs before they are cut, and issued instructions that they be cut. This is like saying tear the seam of trousers to turn them into an izar, and turn the chemise into a rida’ (upper garment). It is well known that these things can only be called a chemise or trousers before their seams are torn. Thus it is known that what has been cut is no longer called a khuff, unless it is called a “cut khuff”, just as one may say “a torn chemise” after its seam has been torn and it is no longer called a chemise or trousers. Similarly, in the case of a dead animal (haywan), after it has died it is no longer an animal, because in fact the haywan (animal) is that in which there is life (hayat)…\nIn this situation, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed that the pilgrim should put on the khuffs [and cut them], and footwear that comes below the ankle is not called khuffs, so it is not appropriate to interpret the Prophet’s words as referring to khuffs, let alone stipulating that he must wear khuffs.\nAnd he said (3/45): We have noted above that in the hadith of Ibn ‘Umar, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not give a concession allowing the wearing of pants or khuffs, rather he gave this concession after ‘Arafah. Thus it is known that his words “let him wear the khuffs and cut them so that they come below the ankles” are explaining what it is permissible to wear, and that it is no longer regarded as khuffs, which are prohibited, as they have become like shoes which are permissible. Otherwise, there would be no difference between wearing them when they are cut and when they are intact. That concession is granted to the one who cannot find shoes, because of the reason mentioned above. Then he granted a concession after that allowing one who cannot find anything else to wear khuffs and trousers. Thus the khuffs that have been cut and the pants that have been torn are permissible to wear in all cases.\nMoreover, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) only forbade the pilgrim in ihram to wear khuffs, as he granted a concession allowing wiping over the khuffs, and whatever comes below the ankle, such as shoes and the like cannot be called khuffs and is not like khuffs, so it is not included in the prohibition. Similarly, it is not included in the permission to wipe over them, especially when his prohibition on wearing khuffs means that other types of footwear are permissible, because he was asked about what garments the pilgrim in ihram may wear, and he said: He may not wear such and such. Thus he mentioned only what is prohibited, so what he did not mention is permissible…\nThe foot is a limb that needs to wear something, so what it needs must be permissible. Many people cannot walk in sandals, so there must be a concession allowing them to wear something similar to shoes and the like. This is in contrast to the hand, which is not usually covered with gloves and the like, because there is no need for that. End quote.\nSecondly:\nIf you need to wear something – shoes or socks – that covers the ankle in order to use orthotics or inserts, there is nothing wrong with that, but you have to offer a fidyah.\nThe fidyah in this case is feeding six poor persons, giving each one half a saa‘ [of foodstuff], or fasting for three days, or slaughtering a sheep [and distributing its meat to the poor of the Haram]. The pilgrim may choose whichever of these three he wishes.\nShaykh Zakariyya al-Ansari (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Asna al-Matalib (1/507): Whoever wears in ihram something that it is haram to wear,\xa0 or he covers something that it is haram to cover, because of a need due to heat, cold, medical treatment, and the like, that is permissible, but he must offer a fidyah. End quote.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: There are three scenarios with regard to one who does things that are prohibited whilst in ihram.\nThe first scenario: he does what is prohibited unnecessarily and with no excuse. In this case, he is sinning and he must offer a fidyah.\nThe second scenario: he does that because he needs to. In this case he is not sinning, but he has to offer a fidyah. So if he needs to cover his head because of cold or heat from which he fears harm, it is permissible for him to cover his head, and he must offer a fidyah.\nThe third scenario: he does that but is excused because he was unaware of the ruling, or because he forgot, or was forced to do it, or was asleep. In that case there is no sin on him, and he does not have to offer a fidyah.""(Majmu‘ Fatawa wa Rasa’il al-‘Uthaymin\xa0 24/433).\nThere is nothing wrong with walking in these shoes when doing sa‘i or tawaf, so long as they are clean.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/376636/ruling-on-wearing-shoes-or-socks-that-cover-the-ankles-when-in-ihram-when-one-has-valid-reason
