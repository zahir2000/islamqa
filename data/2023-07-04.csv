311131,"I am fifty-four years old, and I want to get married. My beard is white; if I dye it some colour other than black, will that be deceiving the woman and her family?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt is recommended to change grey and white hairs with something other than black, because of the hadith of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The Jews and Christians do not dye their hair, so be different from them.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (5899).\nIt was narrated that Jaabir (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Abu Quhafah was brought on the day of the Conquest of Makkah, and his hair and beard were white like hyssop. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Change this with something, but avoid black.” Narrated by Muslim (2102).\nSecondly:\nIt is not permissible to cheat and deceive when proposing marriage, which includes dying grey or white hairs with black, or something close to it, so as to conceal the matter and make people think that there are no grey or white hairs, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever deceives (people) does not belong to me.” Narrated by Muslim (102).\nAn-Nafrawi al-Maliki (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIt is disliked to dye with black hair that is not black, for any purpose that is not prescribed according to Islamic teachings…\nBut if that is done for the purpose of deceit, such as when wanting to marry a woman, there is no doubt that it is prohibited…\nThen he explained what is meant by black being allowed by saying: There is nothing wrong with dying the hair with henna for the length of time that is required to redden the hair, and with katam, which is the leaves of the sullam plant, which turn the hair yellow…\nRather it is disliked to dye the hair with black, unlike other colours, because it is changing it from one colour to another, with the loss of the first colour, in contrast to dyes like henna, because the first colour does not disappear completely; rather it is changed, so no one will be deceived about grey hair if someone has dyed it red or yellow.""(Al-Fawakih ad-Dawani\xa0 2/307-308).\nIt says in Matalib Uli’n-Nuha (1/89): It is disliked to change grey or white hairs with black in situations other than war, and it is prohibited if that is done for the purpose of deceit. End quote.\nSo you may refrain from dyeing the hair, or tell them about it, or dye it with red or yellow in such a way that no one who sees you will be deceived.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/311131/he-is-over-fifty-years-old-and-he-wants-to-propose-to-a-woman-is-it-regarded-as-deceit-if-he-dyes-his-beard-a-colour-other-than-black
130169,"I am a Saudi student in Canada, and I want to complete my master’s degree in engineering. But I am confused about which of five master’s specialties to choose. They are: 1- Urban Planning 2- Urban Design 3- Housing 4- Real Estate Development 5- Urban Management. My question is: should I pray istikharah once and mention all of the specialties [in the supplication], or should I pray istikharah five times in a row, once for each specialty?","['Praise be to Allah.The meaning of istikharah is that the Muslim asks his Lord to choose for him the one of two things that will be better for him in his both his spiritual and worldly affairs.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhat is meant by istikharah is seeking the better of two things.""(Sharh Riyadh as-Salihin\xa0 p. 792).\nHe said in Taj al-‘Arus (11/250):\nIn the hadith of istikharah, it says “Allahumma khir li (O Allah, choose for me), meaning: choose for me the better and most appropriate for me of the two things. End quote.\nThe basic principle regarding istikharah prayer is that it has to do with one matter, which the person may either do or not do.\nBased on that, you have to examine these options, think them over, and consult people of experience, knowledge and reason, until you settle on one thing, then pray istikharah regarding it.\nAn-Nawawi said: It is recommended, before praying istikharah, to consult someone who is known to be sincere, compassionate and experienced, and who is trustworthy in terms of his religious commitment and knowledge. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {and consult them in the matter} [Al ‘Imran 3:159]. So after consulting other and deciding to go ahead, then pray istikharah, asking for Allah’s guidance regarding that.""(Al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah\xa0 2/243).\nDr. Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-‘Aziz al-Musnad said:\nIf the Muslim wants to do something, and he only has one option that he is thinking of doing, then let him pray istikharah and seek Allah’s guidance about doing it, then let him go ahead with it. And if he is thinking of not doing it, then let him pray istikharah and seek Allah’s guidance about not doing it. But if he has a number of options, then first of all – after consulting trustworthy people of knowledge and specialists – he should choose only one of these options, then if he wants to do it, he should pray istikharah before going ahead. End quote.\nIf you prayed istikharah about one of these options, and Allah did not decree it for you, then move onto the next one and pray istikharah, seeking Allah’s guidance, after examining the matter and consulting others.\nIf you prayed istikharah once regarding each of these matters, meaning that you repeated istikharah five times, then you decided on one of them, we do not think there is anything wrong with that.\nAnd Allah knows best.\nFor more information on praying istikharah, please see the answers to questions no. 112151 , 11981 and 2217 .\nWe ask Allah to help and guide you.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/130169/he-has-several-options-in-front-of-him-how-should-he-choose
222753,"My maternal aunt wanted to get married, and she asked me to show her how to send pictures, so that she could send them to the man’s sister, and he would also see them. Did I commit a sin?","['Praise be to Allah.The Lawgiver has made it permissible for the suitor to look at the woman to whom he wants to propose, because there is an interest to be served by that. The basic principle is that he should look at her in real life, not look at her picture, because the interest to be served has to do with looking, which cannot be done properly except by looking at the woman in real life, and because a picture does not usually show reality.\nBut sometimes it may not be possible for the suitor to look at the woman, so he needs to look at her picture, so that by looking at her picture he may get a general impression, that could help him to decide initially whether to go ahead or not, so that when he is able to look at her after that, he may decide to go ahead with the proposal or not.\nSo if the suitor needs to look at the woman to whom he wants to propose, and he can only do that by looking at her picture, and he is serious in his intention to propose, then there is nothing wrong with it, as it serves an important purpose. But that is subject to conditions that we have mentioned in the answer to question no. 132499 , one of which is that what appears in the picture should be the face and hands, and what would normally be uncovered in front of her mahrams, such as the head and neck; another condition is that his seeing the picture should be through a trustworthy intermediary, and the suitor should not keep this picture or show it to anyone else.\nIf the conditions referred to were met, then there is nothing wrong with what you did, in sha Allah.\nIf he changed his mind about this proposal, it is not permissible for him to keep this picture or to make any copies of it, and she should give it back to her friend or to the intermediary through whom she received it.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/222753/helping-the-suitor-to-see-a-picture-of-the-woman-to-whom-he-wants-to-propose
