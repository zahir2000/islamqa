216894,"I would like to ask you about something that is confusing to many women. Many women are wondering how a woman can be certain that she has become pure (that is, her menses has ended) by seeing dryness or the white discharge? The problem with that is that the woman may become pure, with dryness or the white discharge, without realising. That is because she may not be able to keep checking every little while to find out if her menses has ended, because she may be in a meeting or the like. It may be that nothing has happened, but perhaps her being pure because of dryness or the white discharge only lasted for a few minutes, then when she checks to find out whether her menses has ended or not, she sees yellowish or brownish discharge, so she does not know whether this brownish or yellowish discharge came after her menses had ended, as signalled by dryness or the white discharge, or it is part of her menses and she is still menstruating and did not become pure yet.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nA woman may work out whether she has become pure [that is, her menses has ended] by one of two signs: either emission of the white discharge, or complete dryness of that place.\nSecondly:\nA woman has a menstrual cycle that she is familiar with, and she can recognise menstrual blood, and when the period starts and ends.\nSo when the time for her period ends and the time for her becoming pure is close, she should check to see whether she has become pure before she goes to sleep, and at the times of the daily prayers. So she should check before she goes to sleep and at the time of each prayer, to see whether she has become pure or not. If she sees the signs of becoming pure that she recognises in her own case, then she has become pure, and if she does not see that, then she is still menstruating.\nIt says in Mawahib al-Jalil by al-Hattab al-Maliki (1/372):\nMalik said: A woman does not have to keep checking to see whether she has become pure at night and at dawn; rather she should check when she wants to sleep and when she wakes up for the dawn prayer. She should also check at the times of prayer… End quote.\nThe woman should not hasten until she sees the sign that she has become pure [and her menses has ended]. When she sees that, she should do ghusl and pray and fast.\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nBecoming pure from menses happens when there is no trace of blood. So if the woman cleans herself with a piece of cotton or the like, and sees no trace of blood on it, then she must do ghusl, even if she does not see the white discharge. As for the white discharge, it is a white fluid that happens to some women at the end of menses; some women see a white discharge, which is a sign that menses has ended, and some women do not see that. What matters is that it should be clean, so that if a woman wipes herself with a piece of cotton and the like and sees that it is clean, with no yellowish or brownish discharge, then she should do ghusl, \xa0even if she does not see the white discharge.""(Fatawa Nur ‘ala ad-Darb\xa0 5/411).\nIbn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe basic principle is that menses is ongoing until the woman is certain that she has become pure [and menses has ended]. The same applies to anything that already exists; the basic principle is that it still exists until there is certainty that it is no longer there.""(Jalasat Ramadaniyyah\xa0 5/17).\nThirdly:\nAllah has not imposed any hardship on people in religion and the rulings of Islam are easy, with no difficulty or hardship in them; rather they are all easy.\nSo at the time when her period is due to end, a woman only has to check herself before going to sleep and at the times of prayer. She does not have to check constantly whether she has become pure or not.\nUsually, if she is in a meeting or is busy with something, at the time of each prayer she goes to pray. So at those times she can check herself as described above.\nIf a woman makes a mistake in determining the time her period ended, based on what she thinks, she is not sinning, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {And there is no blame upon you for that in which you have erred but [only for] what your hearts intended} [al-Ahzab 33:5]. \xa0But if she thinks that she has become pure [and her period has ended], and she prays and fasts, then she realises that she is still menstruating, she must stop praying and fasting until her period ends, and she must make up any obligatory fasts that she did during those days, because it has become clear that they were not valid.\nIf she does not pray because she thinks that she has not become pure, then she realises that she was pure [not menstruating], then she must make up those prayers, to be on the safe side, but if she does not make them up, then there is no blame on her, in sha Allah.\nSee also the answer to question no. 45885 .\nDoubts and speculation carry no weight, so thinking that perhaps she became pure without realising is of no significance, because Allah does not burden any soul with more than it can bear.\nRegarding the questioner’s words, “perhaps her being pure only lasted for a few minutes, then when she checks to find out whether her menses has ended or not, she sees yellowish or brownish discharge, so she does not know whether this brownish or yellowish discharge was part of her menses or came after her menses had ended,”\nshe is being too hard on herself and there is no need for that. If we were to decide that there is the possibility of the woman becoming pure for five minutes only, then that would mean that she would have to check herself every five minutes to see whether her period had ended or not.\nFor more information, see the answer to question no. 201425 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/216894/how-can-she-know-that-her-menses-has-ended-as-that-may-happen-and-then-be-followed-by-yellowish-or-brownish-discharge-without-her-realising
11731,"In my dreams i have people chasing me, sometimes its members of my family, sometimes people i dont know.it may sound wierd but its true. in such dreams i tend to fly up into the sky 2 escape from them and have been successful in doing so.does this mean Allah takes my soul and makes it actually fly.and also recently i had a dream in which an unknown man was having intercourse with me.i was shocked 2 have such a dream, did Allah take my soul then or was it another trick by shatan.","['Praise be to Allah.What to do if you see unpleasant dreams?\nThese and similar unpleasant dreams come from the Shaytan. What is prescribed for the Muslim, if he sees a dream that he dislikes, is to spit drily to his left three times and to seek refuge with Allah from the Shaytan and from the evil of what he has seen, three times, and he should turn over onto his other side. Then it (his dream) will not harm him. And he should not tell anyone about it , because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The good dream comes from Allah and the bad dream comes from the Shaytan. So if any one of you sees a bad dream which frightens him, let him spit drily to his left and seek refuge with Allah from its evil , then it will not harm him.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, Bad’ Al-Khalq, 3049)\xa0\nDreaming of having sex in Islam\nIf a woman sees in a dream that someone is having intercourse with her, this is something natural, for women may experience erotic dreams just as men do. An erotic dream (or “wet dream ”) is when one imagines doing sexual acts in one’s dream.\xa0\nIt was narrated in a Hadith that Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “Umm Sulaym came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, Allah is not too shy to tell us the truth. Does a woman have to do Ghusl if she experiences an erotic dream ?’ The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘(Yes), if she sees some wetness.’” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, Al-`Ilm, 127).\xa0\nShaykh Al-Bassam (may Allah have mercy on him) said that the word ihtamalat (translated here as “she sees an erotic dream”) refers to whatever a sleeper may see in his dreams, and what it means here is if a woman sees in her dream what men see of images of intercourse and the like.\nIf a woman sees such things in her dream, then if something comes out of her as a result of that dream, she has to do Ghusl.\xa0 But if she simply sees a dream and nothing comes out of her, then she does not have to do Ghusl , because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “If she sees some wetness.” (See Tawdih Al-Ahkam, 1/297)\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11731/ruling-on-dreaming-of-having-sex-in-islam
145166,"Does the commentary on the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {Does he not know that Allah sees} [al-‘Alaq 96:14] indicate that Allah has eyes? If that is not the case, then does Allah have eyes? Is there any proven evidence to that effect?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe way of Ahl as-Sunnah wa’l-Jama‘ah is to affirm the divine attribute of eyes in a manner that is befitting to Him, as He, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the Hearing, the Seeing}\xa0[ash-Shura 42:11].\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The view of Ahl as-Sunnah wa’l-Jama‘ah is that Allah has two eyes with which He sees in a real sense in a manner that is befitting to Him; this is one of the attributes of His Essence.""(Majmu‘ Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthyamin\xa0 4/58).\nSecondly:\nThe texts of the Qur’an and Sunnah affirm the divine attribute of eyes.\nWith regard to evidence from the Qur’an:\n-1-\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And construct the ship under Our watchful eyes and Our inspiration}\xa0[Hud 11:37].\nIt was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said regarding the verse {And construct the ship under Our watchful eyes and Our inspiration} [Hud 11:37]: This refers to the eye of Allah, may He blessed and exalted. This was narrated from him by al-Bayhaqi in al-Asma’ wa’s-Sifat (2/116).\nIbn Jarir at-Tabari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The words {under Our watchful eyes} mean: under the eye of Allah and in accordance His revealed instructions to you.

Indeed Allah is not one-eyed” – and he pointed to his eye – “but the false messiah the Dajjal is one-eyed; his right eye is like a floating grape.”\nIbn Khuzaymah (may Allah have mercy on him) said, after mentioning the texts quoted above: It is obligatory for every believer to affirm for his Creator and Maker what the Creator and Maker affirmed for Himself of eyes. He is not a true believer who denies for Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, what He has affirmed for Himself in a clear text and was explained by the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), to whom Allah gave the task of explaining His words, as He said (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And We revealed to you the message that you may make clear to the people what was sent down to them}\xa0[an-Nahl 16:44].\nSo the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) explained that Allah has two eyes, and his explanation was in accordance with the revealed text, which you find in the pages of the Mushaf and it is recited by the imams in prayer and is taught to children in the schools.""(Kitab at-Tawhid\xa0 1/64).\nWith regard to the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {Does he not know that Allah sees} [al-‘Alaq 96:14], this does not prove the divine attribute of the eyes; rather it affirms the divine attribute of vision and sight. As for affirmation of His eyes, that is a separate issue concerning which you may refer to the texts which speak of it.\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Did the one who forbids the guided to pray not know that Allah sees him and hears his words, and will requite him in full for his actions?""(Tafsir Ibn Kathir\xa0 4/646).\nAl-Bayhaqi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {Does he not know that Allah sees} [al-‘Alaq 96:14] is one of the verses which affirm His vision and sight.""(Al-Asma’ wa’s-Sifat\xa01/461).\nShaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The eye of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, is a real eye. The evidence for that is the fact that Allah Himself has affirmed that in more than one place, and He has affirmed that He sees in more than one place, so He has affirmed one of them sometimes and the other one sometimes, which indicates that they are two different things. So His sight is one thing and His eye is something else. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And say, “Do [as you will], for Allah will see your deeds, and [so, will] His Messenger…”}\xa0[at-Tawbah 9:105]\n{Does he not know that Allah sees?}\xa0[al-‘Alaq 96:14].\nThese two verses are about His sight.\nBut the verses in which He says: {Sailing under Our watchful eyes} [al-Qamar 54:14] and {that you would be brought up under My eye} [Ta-Ha 20:39] are not about His sight; rather they affirm that He has eyes, as opposed to seeing.

281148,"I have read through many Fatwas on this site which can be very close to this scenario. But due to technological advisement it is very hard to draw line between halal or haram so I want you to give Fitwa specifically for this case. I live in New Zealand. Uber has started food delivery service here recently. It is good job as a delivery person because you can work on your own convenience. The restaurants/takeaways on the panel are Halal, non-Halal & vegetarian. It works on the following principles Switch on the app. on your mobile when you are ready/available. A pop-op message will appear on the screen that a meal order is xx min way (xx min is time to reach a restaurant from your current location). When you accept the request then you can see the Restaurant name and address. But once you accept the order, you can’t decline unless your car is broken or in an accident. Once you reach the restaurant and tell your order number, you will be given a sealed bag (you don’t know the contents). After receiving the bag, delivery address appears on the App. My question is that delivering the food for UberEAT is halal or not in the following circumstances You don’t know that from where you will pick the food unless you accept an order and you never get to know what is inside the packet (food/beverages/drinks).","['Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to work in delivering prohibited food such as that which contains pork or the meat of animals that were not slaughtered in the prescribed manner, or alcohol, because that comes under the heading of helping in sin. The wages earned from doing that are also prohibited. Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And cooperate in righteousness and piety, but do not cooperate in sin and aggression. And fear Allah; indeed, Allah is severe in penalty.” [Al-Ma’idah 5:2]\nIt says in Sharh Muntaha Al-Iradat (2/250):\xa0\n“It is not valid to be hired to deliver “dead meat” (from an animal that was not slaughtered in the prescribed manner) and similar things, such as prohibited blood, to be eaten, for one who is not compelled to eat that; or to deliver alcohol to get drunk, for the reasons mentioned above, and the one who does that is not entitled to any wages for doing it, because prohibited service cannot be paid for.\nBut if the improperly-slaughtered meat is being delivered to someone who has no choice but to eat it, then it is valid.”\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “If someone helps a man to disobey Allah, then he is sinning, because he is helping in sin and transgression. Hence the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) cursed alcohol, the one who presses (the grapes et cetera), the one for whom they are pressed, the one who carries it, the one to whom it is carried, the one who sells it, the one who buys it, the one who pours it, the one who drinks it, and the one consumes its price. Most of those mentioned, such as the one who presses it, the one who carries it and the one who pours it, are helping the drinker to drink it. Hence it is forbidden to sell weapons to those who will use them to fight in unlawful ways, such as fighting the Muslims or infighting among Muslims (fitnah).” (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 22/141)\nSince when doing the work mentioned it is not clear what type of food is being delivered, then this work is not permissible, because you are living in a non-Muslim country, where the people usually eat pork and drink alcohol.\nFor more details, please refer to the following answers: 49694 , 172 , 96739 , 40651 , 245688 , and 10339 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/281148/is-it-prohibited-to-deliver-non-halal-food
