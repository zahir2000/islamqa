269845,"If belief in Allah is innate, then why does this Amazonian tribe called Pirahã does not even have basic beliefs in a Creator? Some atheists are using this as an evidence that religious beliefs are not natural to human beings...","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nHumans have an innate knowledge that they have a Creator and Lord. This is one of the clearest proofs for the existence of Allah, may He be exalted.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said:\nThe innate knowledge that Allah exists is stronger than any other evidence for one who has not been misled by the devils. Hence Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{[Adhere to] the natural disposition that Allah instilled in humankind}\xa0[Al-Rum 30:30],\nafter saying: {Adhere exclusively and sincerely to the true faith of monotheism}. So sound human nature testifies to the existence of Allah, and no one can turn away from this innate knowledge except one whom the devils have misled. In the case of one whom the devils have misled, there is a strong reason why this innate knowledge is no longer effective in his case.""(Sharh al-Safariniyyah, p. 31).\nFor information on the evidence for the existence of Allah, may He be exalted, please see the answer to question no. 26745 .\nThe fact that there are people who deny the existence of Allah, may He be exalted, or who associate others with Him, does not mean that they have no innate knowledge of Allah. Rather it means that they have deviated from this innate knowledge, as a result of the devils among humankind and the jinn misleading them, as is mentioned in the hadith qudsi: “I have created all My slaves with the inclination to worship Me alone, but the devils come to them and turn them away from their religion. They forbid to them that which I have permitted to them, and they tell them to associate others with Me for which I have not sent down any authority.” Narrated by Muslim (2865).\nHence the number of these deniers is very few in relation to the total population of the earth; the entire population has innate knowledge that they have a Lord, even if some of them associate others with Him or worship a lord who is not Allah.\nEven if this innate knowledge is undermined by the influence of parents, forefathers, traditions and one’s environment, it often appears at times of hardship, so a man will turn to his Lord even if he has been arguing about His existence!\nThere is an interesting Western proverb which says, “There are no atheists in the trenches [of the battlefield].”\nMany atheists confirm this innate knowledge of Allah and that it is instilled in every soul, even if they do not call it by this name (fitrah).\nFor more information on that, please see the book Shumu‘ al-Nahar by Ustadh ‘Abdullah al-‘Ujayri, p. 31 ff.\nDr al-Bashir ‘Isam says: One of the most famous counterarguments to the evidence of innate knowledge of Allah is the view of some of them, who say that if knowledge of Allah and His existence is instilled in human nature, then why are there people who deny His existence?\nThe answer is: those who affirm the existence of Allah are only those whose human nature is still sound and has not deviated. As for those who were exposed to strong specious arguments, to the point that they uprooted sound human nature from their souls, they will need to study the rational evidence and scientific proof.\nFor sound human nature to be corrupted and changed is not an impossible or far-fetched notion, for a person may grow up in a deviant and misguided environment, so he will be exposed to many deviant ideas that push him away from the straight path.\nIbn Taymiyah said: “Believing in and acknowledging the Creator is something innate and is instilled in the souls of all people, even though some people may be subjected to that which corrupts their sound human nature to the point that they need to reflect deeply on the matter so as to learn again about their Creator.”\nThere is another answer to this question, which is: those who go against their sound human nature and deny the existence of the Creator are very few among humanity throughout history, as noted above.\nMoreover, many of them may deny the existence of Allah outwardly, even though they may inwardly believe in His existence, as Allah, may He be exalted, tells us about Pharaoh and his people and the way in which they reacted to the signs of Allah, may He be glorified. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{They rejected the signs, although in their hearts they were certain that they were true, out of wickedness and arrogance}\xa0[Al-Naml 27:19]. End quote.\nIt says in his article: It is interesting to note that the view that belief in the existence of Allah is instilled in human nature is not something unique to the scholars of Islam; rather it is something that is affirmed by a group of modern philosophers.\nOne of them, for example, is the American philosopher Alvin Plantinga, who insists that faith is something natural, and that belief in the existence of God is like belief in some other basic concepts, such as the belief that others have rational thought like ours, and the belief that our senses are real, and that the whole is greater than the part. End quote.\nSee the rest of his article for further discussion of the idea that there is a great deal of evidence to prove that knowledge of Allah is innate in human beings.\nFinally, we may note that what we have read about the tribe mentioned is that they are very few in number, and that they live a primitive life. We have not come across anything to suggest that they deny the existence of the Creator. There is a difference between a person not being aware of a particular religion, not worshipping Allah in some way or another, and not knowing Allah by His names and attributes, on the one hand, and denying the existence of the Creator, on the other hand.\nSecondly:\nOur advice to you is to seek knowledge and to avoid reading specious arguments that may corrupt your heart and lead you to doubt, unless you are very well versed in knowledge, in which case you may examine specious arguments in order to refute them.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/269845/response-to-the-specious-argument-that-the-existence-of-primitive-tribes-who-do-not-believe-in-god-undermines-the-idea-that-belief-in-the-existence-of-god-is-innate-in-humans
263252,"There is a sick person who, if he stands, he cannot sit down, and if he sits, he cannot stand up. How should he pray? Should he sit throughout the entire prayer, or should he stand throughout the prayer?","['Praise be to Allah.Importance of doing obligatory and pillars parts of the prayer\xa0\nThe basic principle with regard to the pillars and obligatory parts of the prayer is that the worshipper must do whatever he can, and whatever he is not able to do is waived in his case.\nBased on that, if the worshipper is able to start the prayer standing, then this is what he must do, then bow properly if he is able to. If he is not able to do that, then he may lean forward as much as he is able.\nIf he is able to prostrate on the ground, then this is what he must do. If he is not able to prostrate on the ground, then he may sit (on the floor or on a chair), then he may lean forward for prostration.\nIf he is not able to stand up again , then he may complete his prayer sitting , leaning forward for bowing, and prostrating on the ground if he is able to. If he is not able to do that, then he may lean forward for prostration, and make the leaning for prostration lower than the leaning for bowing.\nIn this way, the worshipper will have complied with the words of Allah, may He be exalted (interpretation of the meaning): “So fear Allah as much as you are able”\xa0 [At-Taghabun 64:16], and with the words of the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “If I command you to do anything, do as much of it as you can.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 7288 and Muslim, 1337)\nIn Mukhtasar Khalil, which is a Maliki book, it says: If he is able to do everything, but if he prostrates he cannot get up again , then he should complete a Rak`ah, then remain seated.\nAl-Khurashi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his Sharh (1/298):\xa0\n“That is, if the worshipper is able to do all the pillars of the prayer, namely standing, reciting Fatihah, bowing, prostrating, rising from the two prostrations and sitting, but if he sits he will not be able to get up and stand, then he should do the first Rak`ah standing, and complete the rest of his prayer sitting. This is the view favoured by Al-Lakhmi, At-Tunisi and Ibn Yunus. It was also said that he should offer all of his prayer standing and leaning forward (for bowing and prostration), except the last Rak`ah, in which he should bow and prostrate normally.”\xa0\nCan you pray standing up?\nIf the worshipper is able to stand and lie down, but he is not able to sit, then he may pray standing, leaning forward for bowing and prostrating, and reciting the Tashahhud whilst standing, then saying the Taslim.\nZakariyya Al-Ansari Ash-Shafa`i (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Asna Al-Matalib (1/146):\n“Whoever is able to stand and lie down only, may stand instead of sitting, because standing is like sitting and more, and he should lean forward instead of bowing and prostrating, and recite the Tashahhud whilst standing. He should not lie down.”\xa0\nIn Hashiyat Al-`Ibadi `Ala Tuhfat Al-Muhtaj (2/23) it says:\n“If he is able to stand or to lie down only, i.e., he is not able to sit, then he should stand and that is obligatory, because standing is like sitting and more, and he should lean forward as much as he can whilst standing up for bowing and prostration … and he should recite the Tashahhud and Tasleem whilst standing; he should not lie down.”\xa0\nAl-Khurashi Al-Maliki (may Allah have mercy on him) said (1/297):\n“The one who is unable to do all the pillars of the prayer, except standing, which he is able to do, should do all of his prayer standing, and lean forward more for his prostration than for his bowing.”\xa0\nIf he is not able to stand, then he may pray sitting, and lean forward instead of bowing and prostrating. If he is able to prostrate on the ground, then he must do that.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Mughni (2/570):\n“The scholars unanimously agreed that the one who is not able to stand may pray sitting.”\xa0\nIn Hashiyat Al-Dusuqi (2/475), it says that “the one who is unable to stand may offer the prayer sitting, doing the bowing and prostration from that position.”\xa0\nIf there is a sick person who can either stand for the entire prayer or sit for the entire prayer, then he should pray sitting.\nThis is indicated by the fact that Islamic teaching waives the obligation of standing in some cases, such as in the supererogatory prayers, or when a man who is able to stand prays behind an Imam who is sick and prays sitting; in that case, he should refrain from standing and pray sitting like his Imam.\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Standing is a pillar of the prayer, but it may be waived in any supererogatory prayer, and may be waived in obligatory prayers in some circumstances.” (Sharh Al-`Umdah (4/515)\nIf there is a conflict between standing and sitting, then doing the prayer sitting is what takes precedence, especially when it is possible, when sitting, to do other pillars of the prayer, such as prostrating, sitting between the two prostrations, and sitting to recite the Tashahhud.\xa0\nTherefore, it is more appropriate to pray the entire\xa0 whilst standing.\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 50075 , 180122 , 10352 , and 13406 .\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/263252/cannot-pray-standing-up
444120,"Is it permissible for us to go to public places which are permissible to go to in and of themselves, such as libraries and cafés, where there are pictures on the walls or statues, and also places where they play music, if the individual is not able to put a stop to it? Or should he not go to these places?","['Praise be to Allah.The one who reflects on the state of people nowadays will realise that there is hardly any public place but there will be some objectionable matters in it, to a greater or lesser extent, and this is becoming a widespread problem, which makes some people reluctant to go to these places when there is a need to go to them, whether that is because of a necessity or a need, or for some other reason.\nWhat appears to be the case – and Allah knows best – is that the issue needs some discussion, and it is not right to issue one ruling to cover all places, situations and people.\nFirstly:\nThere are public places that people cannot avoid going to, otherwise it will be detrimental to their well-being, such as hospitals, workplaces and public transit. It is not possible to prevent people from going to such places because of what may be present in them of matters that are objectionable according to Islamic teachings.\nHowever, the individual is required to avoid going to them as much as possible. So in the case of those places that he can avoid going to without that causing him undue hardship and inconvenience, he is required to refrain from going to them and to keep away from them. In the case of those places that he needs to go to, he should strive to not let himself be affected by any objectionable matters in those places, when he does need to go to them. So he should not look at or listen attentively to those objectionable matters, and so on, as much as he can avoid them, and he should seek Allah’s forgiveness for what he could not avoid of those objectionable matters.\nThis was the practice of the Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) in dealing with that which it is very difficult to avoid. It was narrated from Abu Ayyub al-Ansari that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When you go to relieve yourselves, do not face towards the qiblah or turn your backs towards it, whether you are urinating or defecating; rather face towards the east or west.” Abu Ayyub said: We came to Syria and we found latrines that had been built facing towards the qiblah. So we turned ourselves away and asked Allah for forgiveness. Narrated by Muslim (264).\nThe Permanent Committee were asked about similar things and they replied:\nIf you cannot put a stop to music on the bus, and you need to take the bus because the distance is far and you have no other means of transportation, then there is no blame on you for that, but you must denounce the evil as much as you can, even if that is only in your heart.""(Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Da’imah\xa026/241).\nSecondly:\nWith regard to places where the main activity is the open practice of objectionable and haram things, such as parties with music in which there is a combination of music, immodesty and free mixing, then the ruling on such places is that it is haram to go there, whether by oneself or with one’s family and children. More emphatically prohibited are places that are set up for the objectionable and haram matters that are done in those places.\nIt is haram for the Muslim to organise parties or celebrations which involve objectionable and haram matters such as singing, music, mixing between men and women, and bringing charlatans and magicians to perform, because of the abundant religious texts which indicate that these things are prohibited, and that they are causes of falling into what Allah has prohibited of immoral and evil acts.\nAllah, may He be glorified and exalted, has warned those who like to see immorality spread among the believers, and those who promote and help in such things, of a painful punishment, as He, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Indeed, those who like that immorality should be spread [or publicized] among those who have believed will have a painful punishment in this world and the Hereafter}\xa0[Al-Nur 24:19].\nOnce it is established that organising such parties and celebrations is haram, we should understand that attending them is also haram, because it is a waste of money and time on things with which Allah, may He be glorified, is not pleased, and it comes under the heading of cooperating in sin and transgression. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And cooperate in righteousness and piety, but do not cooperate in sin and transgression. And fear Allah; indeed, Allah is severe in penalty}\xa0[Al-Ma’idah 5:2].\nConcerning that, there is also the hadith of which the soundness is agreed upon, according to which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to forbid wasting wealth.""(Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Da’imah\xa026/225).\nThirdly:\nWith regard to places which were basically set up for permissible leisure, such as public parks and seafronts (corniches), there may be some objectionable and haram matters in these places, such as immodesty and the like, but not everyone who goes there will necessarily be affected by that. Hence preventing people from going to such places is obviously too strict and causes extra hardship for people, as their need for such places has become something essential nowadays.\nSo there is nothing wrong with going to such places; however the individual should make sure that his conduct and that of the people with him, and anyone over whom he has any authority, is appropriate and is in accordance with Islamic teachings. And he should strive to make sure that neither he nor his family or those who are with him get involved in anything that is objectionable and haram. So he should avoid taking part in any objectionable matter or watching it, and he should try to forbid any evils that he sees around him as much as he is able to.\nThe greatest good conduct that he should try to do in the places to which he goes out and during his leisure time is establishing prayer on time. Perhaps with the presence of good people, evil will be reduced. This is something that we see in real life. You will find a man giving the adhan in such places, and other people will follow him and pray with him. The reason why they get up and join him is because of his adhan and his openly giving the call to pray in congregation. When evil people find a righteous person in such places, or they see women observing correct shar‘i hijab, many of them will be influenced by those righteous people, especially those who have not yet become fully accustomed to bad conduct. One should also offer advice and exhortation to whomever he can advise and exhort in those places of those who are doing objectionable things. However, we should be keen to seek out the times and places where objectionable and haram matters are least expected.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The prohibitions relating to listening to what is not appropriate have to do with what one actively listens to and focuses on, not merely hearing it. Something similar applies to looking at what is not appropriate; the prohibition has to do with looking deliberately, not an involuntary glance… The same applies to doing haram deeds that involve any of the five senses, namely hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting and touching. The prohibitions apply to when one intentionally and actively does those things. As for what happens involuntarily, the prohibitions do not apply to it.""(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa\xa0 5/566).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/444120/what-is-the-ruling-on-going-to-public-places-where-there-are-objectionable-things
121948,What is the virtue of Ahl al-Bayt and their superiority over other people? Will they intercede for the people on the Day of Resurrection?,"['Praise be to Allah.Who are Ahl Al-Bayt?\nIn the answer to question no.\xa010055 ,\xa0we explained that Ahl Al-Bayt are the members of the household of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). At the end of that answer we said:\xa0\n“So the family members of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) are: his wives, his children, and Banu Hashim, Banu `Abd Al-Muttalib and their freed slaves.”\xa0\nRights of Ahl Al-Bayt\nAllah has bestowed upon the Ahl al-Bayt of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) numerous virtues. Ahl As-Sunnah wa’l-Jama`ah are unanimously agreed that it is obligatory to love them and respect their rights. \xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Similarly the family of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) have rights which must be paid attention to. Allah has allocated to them a share of the khums and fay’, and He has enjoined that blessings be sent upon them along with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), who said to us: “Say: ‘Allahumma salli ‘ala Muhammadin wa ‘ala ali Muhammadin kama salayta ‘ala ali Ibrahim, innaka Hamidun Majid, wa barik ‘ala Muhammadin wa ‘ala ali Muhammadin kama barakta ‘ala ali Ibrahim innaka Hamidun Majid (O Allah, send prayer upon Muhammad and upon the family of Muhammad, as You sent prayers upon the family of Ibrahim; You are indeed Worthy of Praise, Full of Glory. And send blessings upon Muhammad and upon the family of Muhammad, as You sent blessings upon the family of Ibrahim; You are indeed Worthy of Praise, Full of Glory)’”. (Majmu’ Al-Fatawa, 3/407)\xa0\nAnd he also said:\xa0\n“Similarly, with regard to the family of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) (Ahl Al-Bayt), it is obligatory to love them, be loyal to them and respect their rights.” (Majmu’ Al-Fatawa, 28/491)\nVirtues of Ahl Al-Bayt\nThe virtues of the family of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) are:\xa0\n\nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n“O wives of the Prophet! You are not like any other women. If you keep your duty (to Allah), then be not soft in speech, lest he in whose heart is a disease (of hypocrisy, or evil desire for adultery) should be moved with desire, but speak in an honourable manner. And stay in your houses, and do not display yourselves like that of the times of ignorance, And perform As-Salah (Iqamat-As-Salah), and give Zakah and obey Allah and His Messenger. Allah wishes only to remove Ar-Rijs (evil deeds and sins) from you, O members of the family (of the Prophet), and to purify you with a thorough purification.” [Al-Ahzab 33:32, 33]\nThis does not apply only to the Prophet’s wives (may Allah be pleased with them); rather it is narrated in the sahih Sunnah that it also includes others. It was narrated that ’Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said:\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) went out one morning wearing a striped cloak of black camel hair. Al-Hasan ibn ‘Ali came and he enfolded him in the cloak, then al-Husayn came and he enfolded him in it, then Fatimah came and he enfolded her in it, then ‘Ali came and he enfolded him in it, then he said: “Allah wishes only to remove Ar-Rijs (evil deeds and sins) from you, O members of the family (of the Prophet), and to purify you with a thorough purification.” [Al-Ahzab 33:33]\xa0 \xa0(Narrated by Muslim, 2424)\xa0\n\nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n“The Prophet is closer to the believers than their own selves, and his wives are their (believers’) mothers (as regards respect and marriage).” [Al-Ahzab 33:6]\n\nIt was narrated that Wathilah ibn Al-Asqa’ said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say:\n\n“Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, chose Kinanah from among the children of Isma’il (peace be upon him), and He chose Quraysh from among Kinanah, and He chose Banu Hashim from among Quraysh, and He chose me from among Banu Hashim.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2276)\xa0\n\nIt was narrated that Zayd ibn Arqam said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stood and addressed us at a watering place called Khumm, between Makkah and Madinah. He praised and glorified Allah, and he exhorted and reminded us, then he said: “O people, I am only human, and soon the messenger of my Lord will come to me and I will respond. I am leaving among you two weighty things, the first of which is the Book of Allah in which is guidance and light. Follow the Book of Allah and hold fast to it.” And he encouraged us to adhere to the Book of Allah, then he said: “And the people of my household, I remind you of Allah with regard to the people of my household, I remind you of Allah with regard to the people of my household, I remind you of Allah with regard to the people of my household.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2408)\xa0\n\nThe Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) paid attention to this commandment; foremost among them were Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq and `Umar ibn Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with them).\xa0\nAl-Bukhari (3508) and Muslim (1759) narrated that Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) said to ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him): “By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, kinship with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is dearer to me than kinship with my own people.”\xa0\nAl-Bukhari also narrated in his Sahih (3509) that Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “Pay attention to the rights of the household of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).”\xa0\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“The words “Pay attention to the rights of the household of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)” are addressed to the people, enjoining them to fulfill the rights of Ahl Al-Bayt.” (Fath Al-Bari, 7/79)\xa0\nWith regard to the respect of `Umar ibn Al-Khattaab for the relatives of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), that is apparent from many things, such as his preferring to put the ahead of himself or any other people with regard to allocating shares from bayt al-mal.\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Moreover, when ‘Umar ibn Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) set up the registry of stipends, he wrote\xa0 down people’s names according to their lineage, so he started with those who were closest in lineage to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), When he had finished listing the Arabs, he listed the non-Arabs. This is how the registry was at the time of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs, and all the caliphs of the Umayyad and ‘Abbasid dynasties, until things changed after that.” \xa0(Iqtida’ Al-Sirat Al-Mustaqim, p. 159, 160)\xa0\nWill Ahl Al-Bayt intercede on the Day of Resurrection?\xa0\nThere is no intercession specifically for the family of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), rather that is something that may be granted to all those among the righteous, the martyrs and the scholars with whose intercession Allah is pleased, whether they are among Ahl Al-Bayt or are from among the ordinary people.\xa0\nIn the answer to question no.\xa021672 ,\xa0we said: “Intercession for those who committed sin will not be granted only to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), rather the prophets, the martyrs, the scholars, the righteous and the angels will also join in that. A man’s righteous deeds may also intercede for him. But the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) will have the greatest share of intercession.”\nThus we may know the response to the extremists among the Rafidis who claim that intercession is only for the family of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Rather it is stated in their books that Ahl Al-Bayt are the ones who will admit people to Paradise and to Hell! This is just part of a lengthy list of the different types of exaggeration that they have, the source of which is their ignorance of the religion of Allah, may He be exalted, and their keeping away from the texts of Revelation in the Quran and Sunnah.\xa0\nWe advise you to read an essay entitled Fadl Ahl Al-Bayt wa ‘Uluw Makanatihim ‘inda Ahl Al-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah, written by Shaykh ‘Abd Al-Muhsin ibn Hamad Al-‘Abbad Al-Badr, which we have benefited from in composing this answer, and which contains additional research on this topic.

42216,I would like to ask a question about `Aqeedah. Is it part of our `Aqeedah to believe that the Prophets committed sins and were not infallible?,"[""Praise be to Allah.Are Prophets infallible?\nThe Prophets are the best of mankind, and the most noble of creation before Allah. Allah chose them to convey the call of La ilaha ill-Allah (none has the right to be worshipped but Allah) to mankind, and Allah has made them the intermediaries between Him and His creation in conveying His Laws. They were commanded to convey the message from Allah, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n\xa0“They are those whom We gave the Book, Al-Hukm (understanding of the religious laws), and Prophethood. But if these disbelieve therein (the Book, Al-Hukm and Prophethood), then, indeed We have entrusted it to a people (such as the Companions of Prophet Muhammad) who are not disbelievers therein.” [Al-An`am 6:89]\xa0\nThe Prophets’ task was to convey the message from Allah even though they were human, hence the issue of infallibility may be examined from two angles:\xa0\n\nInfallibility in conveying the message\nInfallibility from human error\xa0\n\nInfallibility of Prophets in conveying the message\nThe Prophets were infallible in conveying the message from Allah. They did not conceal anything that Allah had revealed to them, and they did not add anything from themselves. Allah said to His Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n\xa0“O Messenger (Muhammad)! Proclaim (the Message) which has been sent down to you from your Lord. And if you do not, then you have not conveyed His Message. Allah will protect you from mankind.” [Al-Ma'idah 5:67]\xa0\n“And if he (Muhammad) had forged a false saying concerning Us (Allah), We surely would have seized him by his right hand (or with power and might), \xa0And then We certainly would have cut off his life artery (aorta), And none of you could have withheld Us from (punishing) him.” [Al-Haqqah 69:44-47]\nAllah also says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And he (Muhammad) withholds not a knowledge of the Unseen.” [Al-Takwir 81:24]\nShaykh `Abd Ar-Rahman ibn Sa`di (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his commentary on this verse: “He is not stingy with that which Allah has revealed to him, concealing some of it. Rather he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was the most trustworthy of the inhabitants of heaven and the people of earth, the one who conveys the message of his Lord, the faithful conveyor (of the message). He does not withhold any part of it, from rich or poor, from ruler or subject, from male or female, from city-dweller or Bedouin. Hence Allah sent him to an illiterate and ignorant nation, and he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not die until they had become knowledgeable scholars, steeped in knowledge…”\nThus, with regard to conveying the religion of his Lord, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not make any mistakes at all, whether major or minor, rather he was infallible and under the constant protection of Allah.\xa0\nShaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Fatawa Ibn Baz, (6/371):\xa0\n“All the Muslims are unanimously agreed that the Prophets (peace be upon them) – especially Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) – are infallible and protected from error in that which they conveyed from Allah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“By the star when it goes down (or vanishes). Your companion (Muhammad) has neither gone astray nor has erred. Nor does he speak of (his own) desire. It is only a Revelation revealed. He has been taught (this Quran) by one mighty in power [Gabriel].” [An-Najm 53:1-5]\nOur Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is infallible in all that he conveyed from Allah, in word and action and in what he approved of. There is no dispute on this point among the scholars.”\nThe Ummah agreed that the Messengers are infallible in their conveying the message. They did not forget anything that Allah revealed to them, except for things that were abrogated. Moreover, Allah guaranteed His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that he would remember it and would not forget it, except for that which Allah wanted him to forget, and He guaranteed that he would remember the whole Quran in his heart. Allah said (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“We shall make you recite (the Quran), so you (O Muhammad) shall not forget (it).” [Al-A’la 87:7]\xa0\n“It is for Us to collect it and to give you (O Muhammad) the ability to recite it (the Quran). And when We have recited it to you [O Muhammad through Jibreel (Gabriel)], then follow its (the Quran’s) recitation.” [Al-Qiyamah 75:17-18]\nShaykh Al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him)] said in Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 18/7]:\xa0\n“The verses which point to the Prophethood of the Prophets indicate that they are infallible with regard to the message that they convey from Allah, so what they convey from their Lord can only be true. This is the meaning of Prophethood and this implies that Allah tells [the Prophet] of the unseen and he tells the people of the unseen. So the Messenger is commanded to call people and to convey the message to them.”\xa0\nInfallibility of the Prophets from human errors\nWith regard to the Prophets as people, they may make mistakes. This may be discussed as follows:\xa0\nThey do not commit major sins\nWith regard to major sins, the Prophets do not commit major sins at all , and they are protected from such major sins both before their missions began or afterwards.\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 4/319:\xa0\n“The view that the Prophets are infallible and protected against committing major sins , as opposed to minor sins, is the view of the majority of Muslim scholars and of all groups. It is also the view of the scholars of Tafsir and Hadith and jurists. Indeed, nothing has been narrated from any of the Salaf, Imams, the Companions, the generation after them, and those who followed them except that which is in accordance with this view.”\xa0\nMatters that have nothing to do with conveying the message and the revelation\xa0\nWith regard to minor sins, these may be committed by them, or by some of them. Hence the majority of scholars are of the view that they are not infallible when it comes to minor sins. Nonetheless, if they committed such actions they were not left to persist therein, rather Allah pointed that out to them and they hastened to repent therefrom.\xa0\nThe evidence that they might commit minor sins and that they were not left to persist therein is:\n\nThe verses in which Allah says of Adam (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n\n“Thus did Adam disobey his Lord, so he went astray. \xa0Then his Lord chose him, and turned to him with forgiveness, and gave him guidance.” [Ta-Ha 20:121-122]\xa0\nThis indicates that Adam committed sin, but he was not left to persist therein, and he repented to Allah from that.\xa0\n\nAlso, Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n\n“He said: `This is of Satan’s doing, verily, he is a plain misleading enemy.’ He said: `My Lord! Verily, I have wronged myself, so forgive me.’ Then He forgave him. Verily, He is the Oft-Forgiving, the Most Merciful.” [Al-Qasas 28:15-16]\nSo Moses (peace be upon him) confessed his sin and sought forgiveness from Allah after he killed the Egyptian, and Allah forgave him his sin.\n\nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n\n“…and he [Dawud] sought forgiveness of his Lord, and he fell down prostrate and turned (to Allah) in repentance. So We forgave him that, and verily, for him is a near access to Us, and a good place of (final) return (Paradise).” [Sad 38:23-24]\nDawud’s sin was hastening to pass judgement before hearing the case of the second disputant.\n\nOur Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was rebuked by his Lord for several things that are mentioned in the Quran, such as the following (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n\n\xa0“O Prophet! Why do you forbid (for yourself) that which Allah has allowed to you, seeking to please your wives? And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” [At-Tahrim 66:1]\nThis refers to the well-known story with some of his wives.\n\nAllah also rebuked His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) concerning the prisoners of war at Badr:\xa0\n\nMuslim (4588) narrated that Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: When the prisoners were taken captive, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to Abu Bakr and `Umar (may Allah be pleased with them): “What do you think about these prisoners?” Abu Bakr said: “O Prophet of Allah, they are our cousins and kinsmen. I think that we should accept a ransom from them which will give us some support against the disbelievers, and perhaps Allah will guide them to Islam.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “What do you think, O Ibn Al-Khattab?” He said: “I say, no, by Allah, O Messenger of Allah. I do not agree with Abu Bakr. I think that you should hand them over to us so that we may strike their necks (execute them). Hand over `Aqil to `Ali so that he may strike his neck, and hand over So and so – a relative of `Umar – to me, for these are the leaders and veterans of disbelief.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) liked what Abu Bakr said and he did not like what I [`Umar] said. The next day I came and found the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and Abu Bakr weeping. I said: “O Messenger of Allah, tell me, what has made you and your companion weep? If there is a reason to weep, I will weep with you, and there is no reason, I will force myself to weep in sympathy with you because you are weeping.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I am weeping because I was shown the torture to which they were subjected. It was brought as close to me as this tree” – a tree which was near the Prophet of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) – then Allah revealed the words (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“It is not for a Prophet that he should have prisoners of war (and free them with ransom) until he had made a great slaughter (among his enemies) in the land. You desire the good of this world (i.e. the money of ransom for freeing the captives), but Allah desires (for you) the Hereafter. And Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.\nWere it not a previous ordainment from Allah, a severe torment would have touched you for what you took.\nSo enjoy what you have gotten of booty in war, lawful and good.” [Al-Anfal 8:67-69]\nSo Allah permitted booty to them.\xa0\nFrom this Hadith it is clear that when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) chose to ransom the prisoners, this was a decision that he made by Ijtihad after consulting his companions, and he had no revelation from Allah concerning that.\xa0\n\nThe words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n\n“(The Prophet) frowned and turned away.\nBecause there came to him the blind man (i.e. `Abdullah ibn Umm Maktum, who came to the Prophet while he was preaching to one or some of the Quraysh chiefs).” [`Abas 80:1-2]\nThis is the famous story of the great companion `Abdullah ibn Umm Maktum (may Allah be pleased with him) and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), when Allah rebuked him.\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Majmoo’ Al-Fatawa (4/320):\xa0\n“What has been narrated from the majority of scholars is that they (the Prophets) are not infallible with regard to minor sins, but they are not left to persist therein. They do not say that this does not happen under any circumstances. The first group from whom it was narrated that they are infallible in all cases, and who say that the most, are the Rafidis (Shi’ah), who say that they are infallible and protected even against forgetfulness and misunderstanding.”\xa0\nSome people think this is too much to suggest that Prophets may commit sin, and misinterpret some of the texts of the Quran and Sunnah which indicate that. Two specious arguments lead them to do that:\xa0\n\nThe fact that Allah has commanded us to follow the Messengers and take them as our example. The command to follow them is taken as meaning that everything they did is an example for us to follow, and that every action and belief of theirs is an act of worship. If we suggest that that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) committed a sin, there will be a dilemma, because that implies that we are commanded to imitate this sin which was committed by the Prophet because we are commanded to follow his example, but at the same time we should no agree with it or do it, because it is a sin. \xa0\n\nThis argument is valid and is appropriate if the sin is hidden and not obvious in such a way that it could be confused with acts of obedience. But Allah has explained to His Messengers where they went wrong and enabled them to repent without delay.\xa0\n\nSins contradict perfection and are a shortcoming. This is true if they are not accompanied by repentance, for repentance brings forgiveness of sin, and does not contradict perfection or bring blame upon a person. Rather in many cases a person may be better after repenting than he was before he fell into sin. It is well known that no Prophet committed sin but he hastened to repent and seek forgiveness. The Prophets did not persist in sin or delay repentance, for Allah protected them from that, and after repenting they became more perfect than they were before.\xa0 \xa0\n\nUnintentional mistakes with regard to some worldly matters\nWith regard to mistakes in some worldly matters, it is permissible for them to make such mistakes although their reason is sound and their insight is strong. This happened to several of the Prophets including our Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). This happened with regard to various spheres of life such as medicine, agriculture, etc.\xa0\nMuslim (6127) narrated that Rafi ibn Khadij (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came to Madinah and found them pollinating the palm trees. He said: “What are you doing?” They said: “We always do this.” He said: “Perhaps if you do not do it, that will be better.” So they did not do it, and the harvest failed. They told him about that and he said: “I am only human. If I tell you to do something with regard to your religion, then do it, but if I tell you to do something based on my own opinion, then I am only human.” Hence it is known that the Prophets are infallible and protected from error with regard to the Revelation, so we should beware of those who cast aspersions upon the Messenger’s conveying of the Message and about laws he legislated, and say that it is his own personal opinion. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) could never do such a thing. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Nor does he speak of (his own) desire.\nIt is only a Revelation revealed.” [Al-Najm 53:3-4]\nThe Standing Committee was asked: Do the Prophets and Messengers make mistakes?\xa0\nThey replied:\xa0\n“Yes, they make mistakes but Allah does not let them persist in their mistakes, rather He points out their mistakes to them as a mercy to them and their nations, and He forgives them for their mistakes, and accepts their repentance by His Grace and Mercy, for Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful, as will be clear to anyone who studies the verses of the Quran which speak of that.” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Al-Da’imah, 3/194)\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/42216/are-prophets-infallible
