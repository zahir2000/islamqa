293857,Is breaking the fast with an odd number of dates a Sunnah from the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him)? And is eating an odd number of dates a Sunnah during Ramadan or outside of Ramadan?,"['Praise be to Allah.It is not established that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) deliberately ate an odd number of dates or recommended doing so, except on two occasions:\nThe first: Before going out for the Salah of `Eid Al-Fitr.\nAl-Bukhari (953) narrated from Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: ""The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) would not go out on the morning of `Eid Al-Fitr until he had eaten an odd number of dates.""\nThe second occasion:\nEating seven dates in the morning.\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: ""Whoever eats seven `Ajwa dates in the morning, will not be harmed by poison or magic on that day"" narrated by Al-Bukhari (5445), and Muslim (2047).\nAs for breaking the fast, it is established that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) would break his fast with fresh dates or dry dates, and it is not established that he (peace and blessings be upon him) intended a specific number or that they be an odd number.\nThe Hadith reported in this regard is weak.\nIt was narrated from Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: ""The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) liked to break his fast with three dates or something that fire had not touched."" Musnad Abu Ya`la (3305).\nThis is a weak Hadith and is not established, see: ""Silsilat Al-Ahadith Ad-Da`ifah"" by Al-Albani (966).\nSome scholars have chosen to limit this to what is established from the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) and not to expand in seeking to eat an odd number.\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n""It is not obligatory - nor even a Sunnah - that a person breaks his fast on an odd number: three, five, seven, or nine, except on the day of `Eid, `Eid Al-Fitr, as it is established ""that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) would not go out for the prayer on the day of `Eid Al-Fitr until he had eaten dates, and he would eat them in an odd number"" and other than that, the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) did not intend to eat dates in an odd number."" End quote from ""Fatawa Nur `Ala Ad-Darb"" (11/2) with numbering from Ash-Shamela.\nOther scholars have taken a broader view on this matter, citing the saying of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him): ""Indeed, Allah is Odd (Witr) and He loves odd numbers"" narrated by Al-Bukhari (6410), and Muslim (2677) from the Hadith of Abu Hurairah (may Allah be pleased with him).\n`Abd Ar-Razzaq (5/498) narrated this Hadith and then said: Ayyub said: ""Ibn Sirin used to prefer odd numbers in everything, to the extent that he would eat an odd number."" And this chain of narration is authentic.\nIt is mentioned in ""I\'anat At-Talibin (2/278):\n""(His statement: \'And the most complete is that it be)\n\xa0i.e., breaking the fast with dates.\n(His statement: \'With three\')\n\xa0i.e., with three dates, and like dates, whatever one breaks the fast with, it is Sunnah to do so in threes."" End quote.\nShaykh Saleh Al-Fawzan (may Allah preserve him) was asked:\n""Is the practice of eating an odd number applicable to all permissible things, such as drinking coffee and others, or is it only for things that have been textually specified?""\nThe Shaykh answered (in summary), ""All statements and actions can be done in odd numbers; this is from the Sunnah."" End quote.\nShaykh Abdul Karim Al-Khudair (may Allah preserve him) was asked:\nShould one intend worship of Allah by eating and drinking (and doing other things) in odd numbers?\nHe answered: ""Yes, one should intend worship by doing so. If one eats, he should eat one date, three dates, seven, an odd number; because Allah loves the odd number."" End quote.\nWhat supports the view that it is preferred to eat an odd number of dates when breaking the fast is the action of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) in doing so on the day of `Eid, and his recommendation to eat an odd number of dates in the morning; this indicates his preference of odd numbers at the beginning of what he would break his fast with from dates and fresh dates; thus, breaking the fast from fasting is like that.\nThe matter in this regard is broad, in sha Allah; whoever chooses the odd number, based on the general evidence previously mentioned, and what is attested by the action of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) in the mentioned instances, or finds comfort in the specific Hadith reported in this regard, despite its weakness: there is no harm upon him.\nAnd whoever sees that breaking the fast on dates, fresh dates, and the like, should be however it happens, without deliberately seeking an odd number or not, due to the lack of specific proof from the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him): there is no harm upon him, and this position is also clear.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/293857/breaking-the-fast-with-an-odd-number-of-dates
222334,"What is the ruling on praying optional prayers in Ramadan? What is the number of Rak`ahs that it is prescribed to pray in Tarawih? I have seen some deviant groups, such as the Sufis and others, praying Tarawih with thirty Rak`ahs. Is there any evidence for that?","['Praise be to Allah.Offering optional prayers in Ramadan\nOffering optional prayers in Ramadan, especially voluntary night prayers (Qiyam) , comes under the heading of that which is encouraged, because of the general encouragement to do acts of worship in Ramadan, both prayers and other things, and because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) recommended praying Qiyam in Ramadan especially. He said: “Whoever prays Qiyam in Ramadan out of faith and in the hope of reward, his previous sins will be forgiven.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 37 and Muslim, 759)\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) included it in a chapter entitled: Chapter: Encouragement to pray Qiyam in Ramadan, which is Tarawih.\xa0\nSo it is encouraged for the Muslim in Ramadan to regularly offer the optional prayers both before and after the obligatory prayers, and to regularly offer Tarawih prayers in congregation with the Muslims. It is also encouraged for him to offer optional prayers in general, except at the times when doing so is disliked.\xa0\nHow Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) prayed Tarawih\nThe Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not offer more than eleven Rak`ahs [in Qiyam Al-layl], either during Ramadan or at other times, although occasionally he prayed thirteen Rak`ahs.\xa0\nAl-Bukhari (3569) and Muslim (738) narrated from Abu Salamah ibn `Abd Ar-Rahman (may Allah have mercy on him) that he asked `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her): How did the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) pray during Ramadan? She said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not pray more, in Ramadan or at any other time, than eleven Rak`ahs. He would pray four Rak`ahs, and do not ask how beautiful and long they were. Then he would pray four, and do not ask how beautiful and long they were. Then he would pray three. `A’ishah said: I said: O Messenger of Allah, do you sleep before you pray Witr? He said: “O `A’ishah, my eyes sleep but my heart does not sleep.”\xa0\nAl-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated that `A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would pray thirteen Rak`ahs at night, then he when he heard the call for Fajr prayer, he would pray two brief Rak`ahs.\xa0\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“And it is narrated from `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) in Al-Bukhari that he prayed seven or nine Rak`ahs. After that, Al-Bukhari and Muslim narrated the Hadith of Ibn `Abbas that he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would pray thirteen Rak`ahs at night, and two Rak`ahs after dawn, the Sunnah prayer of Fajr. According to the Hadith of Zayd ibn Khalid, he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would pray two brief Rak`ahs and two long ones… and he narrated the Hadith, at the end of which he said: And that was thirteen Rak`ahs.\xa0\nAl-Qadi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The scholars said: In these Hadiths, Ibn `Abbas, Zayd and `A’ishah each spoke of what they saw.”\nIs it permissible to pray 30 Rak`ahs in Tarawih?\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not specify any maximum number (of Rak`ahs) for Tarawih prayer , and the matter is broad in scope, in sha Allah.\xa0\nSo, there is nothing wrong with someone praying more than eleven Rak`ahs, because of the general meaning of the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “The night prayers are two by two, then if one of you fears that dawn may come, he should pray one Rak`ah, which will make what he has prayed odd-numbered.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 472 and Muslim, 749)\xa0\nThis is also the view of the jurists of Madhhabs (schools of jurisprudence) in various regions. According to the Hanafi Madhhab it is twenty Rak`ahs, as is also the view of Imam Ahmad. According to Imam Malik, it is thirty-six Rak`ahs, and there is nothing wrong with a person doing any of these options, or others.\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said, after mentioning the difference of opinion among the scholars concerning that:\xa0\n“The correct view is that all of that is good, as was stated by Imam Ahmad (may Allah be pleased with him), and there is no particular number with regard to Qiyam Al-layl in Ramadan. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not specify any number for that. As that is the case, one may offer more or fewer Rak`ahs, according to how long or short one wants to make the standing. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to make his standing lengthy, as it is proven from him in an authentic narration, in the Hadith of Hudhayfah (may Allah be pleased with him), that he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to recite in one Rak`ah Al-Baqarah, An-Nisa’ and Al `Imran. Making the standing lengthy suffices instead of praying a greater number of Rak`ahs. When Ubayy ibn Ka`b led them in praying Qiyam, when they were a single congregation, he would not make the standing lengthy for them, so he prayed a greater number of Rak`ahs, instead of making the standing lengthy, and they made the number of Rak`ahs double that of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), for he used to pray eleven or thirteen Rak`ahs of Qiyam Al-layl. Then after that the people in Madinah grew too weak to make the standing lengthy, so they increased the number of Rak`ahs until it reached thirty-nine.” (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 23/113; see also 23/120)\xa0\nThe scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas said:\xa0\n“No specific number has been proven with regard to the number of Rak`ahs in Tarawih prayer, and the scholars differed concerning that. Some of them think that it is twenty-three, some think it is thirty-six, some think that it is more and some think that it is less. At the time of `Umar the Companions prayed it with twenty-three Rak`ahs in the mosque of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), but the Prophet never prayed more than eleven or thirteen Rak`ahs, whether in Ramadan or otherwise, and he did not set any specific number for the people to pray in Tarawih and Qiyam Al-layl . Rather he used to urge the people to pray qiyam Al-layl and to pray Qiyam in Ramadan in particular. He (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would say: “Whoever prays Qiyam in Ramadan out of faith and in the hope of reward, his previous sins will be forgiven”, and he did not specify the number of Rak`ahs, which varies according to the nature of the standing. Whoever makes his prayer lengthy may reduce the number of Rak`ahs, as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did, and whoever makes the prayer more brief, out of kindness towards the people, may make the number of Rak`ahs greater, as the Companions did at the time of `Umar. There is nothing wrong with increasing the number of Rak`ahs in the last ten nights of Ramadan, making it greater than in the first twenty nights, and dividing them into two sections, one to be offered at the beginning of the night and made brief, like Tarawih in the first twenty nights, and another section to be offered at the end of the night and made lengthy, to be regarded as Tahajjud. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to pray Tahajjud in the last ten nights as he never did at any other time.” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, vol. 2, 6/82)\nIn conclusion, there is no specific number of Rak`ahs for Tarawih prayer, such that it is not allowed to do more or less than that. Whoever prays Tarawih with thirty Rak`ahs, or more or less than that, there is no blame on him, and he is not innovating by doing that.\xa0\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“There is no specific number for Tarawih prayer . Whoever prays twenty, there is nothing wrong with that; whoever prays thirty, there is nothing wrong with that; whoever prays forty, there is nothing wrong with that; whoever prays eleven, there is nothing wrong with that; whoever prays thirteen, there is nothing wrong with that; and whoever prays more or less than that, there is nothing wrong with that. The matter is broad in scope.” (Fatawa Nur `Ala Ad-Darb (9/437)\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/222334/is-it-permissible-to-pray-30-rakahs-in-tarawih
366204,"I want to inquire about menstruation. I felt pain about twenty minutes before Maghrib, so I went to check, but nothing had come out, so I completed my fasting. When I went to perform Wudu’ for the Maghrib prayer, I felt very severe pain, so I purified myself as best as I could, then went out to pray and performed the prayer. During my prayer, the pain lessened, and usually, when the pain subsides, it means that menstruation has started, but I did not cut off my prayer and completed it because I did not feel the menstruation coming. I completed the prayer, and when I finished, I entered the bathroom and wiped to check, and there was menstrual blood as if it had just come out. My question is, should I repeat the Maghrib prayer? And should I repeat the fasting for that day or not?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nYour fasting for this day is valid because you did not see the blood nor feel its discharge before Maghrib, and the principle is that if there is doubt about the timing of the blood discharge, whether it was before or after Maghrib, it is is attributed to the nearest time, and this is one of the principles of Jurisprudence. The nearest time here is after Maghrib.\nThe meaning of the principle is: ""When there is a difference in the timing of an event\'s occurrence, and there is no evidence to determine it - then this event is attributed to the closest time to the current situation; because that is certain, and the further time is doubtful. However, if its attribution to the further time is established, then it must be acted upon."" End quote from ""Encyclopedia of Jurisprudential Principles"" by Dr. Muhammad Sidqi Al-Borno (12/316).\nAs-Suyuti (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his book ""Al-Ashbah wan-Nadha\'ir"" page 59: ""Principle: The origin of every event is to estimate it by the nearest time. Among its branches: If he sees semen on his garment and does not remember having a wet dream, the correct opinion is that he must perform Ghusl. Ash-Shafi`i said in Al-Umm: \'And he must repeat every Salah he has performed since the last time he slept.\'"" End quote.\nSecondly:\nAs for the Maghrib prayer, if you think it most likely that the blood was discharged during it due to the light pain—as you mentioned—and because you saw the blood fresh after the prayer, and the like, which indicates a most likely opinion, then the prayer is not valid, and you must repeat it once you become pure.\nIf there is no feeling of likelihood, but rather doubt, then the prayer is valid; because of what we have previously mentioned that the event is attributed to the nearest time, and it is judged that the blood was discharged after the prayer.\nSheikh Muhammad ibn Muhammad Al-Mukhtar Ash-Shanqiti (may Allah preserve him) was asked about a woman who saw some menstrual blood after the Maghrib prayer and did not know whether it was discharged before sunset or after; what is the ruling regarding her prayer and fasting?\nHe replied: ""If she saw the blood and thinks it most likely that it was discharged before sunset, then there is no doubt that the fast of that day is void and she must make it up.\nBut if she thinks it most likely that the blood is fresh and that it was discharged after Maghrib, then there is no doubt about the validity of her fast, and the Maghrib prayer is obligatory when she becomes pure; for she must make it up and perform it.\nBut if she is hesitant and doubtful, then the principle among the scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) says: (It is attributed to the nearest event), so the original ruling is the validity of the fast until evidence indicates its invalidity, and the original ruling is that she fasted a complete day, and she is free of liability until we ascertain the existence of this factor, so her fast is judged to be valid.\nAs for the blood, it has no effect on that day, and the issue remains the opposite, because if you say: her fast is valid, she is obliged to make up Maghrib, and if you say: her fast is not valid, there is no making up of Maghrib, for if she is exempted from fasting, she is obliged to make up Maghrib; because the entry of the time renders the menstruating woman liable, and it is not considered at the end of the time as the Hanafi Jurists and some of the companions of Imam Ahmad say.""
