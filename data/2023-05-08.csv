279129,"I previously asked you, in question no. 278157, about getting a job on the basis of a degree which was obtained with some cheating, and the ruling on the salary that is based on having that degree, and you referred me to question number 26123 , which quoted a fatwa from Shaykh ‘Abd al-Karim al-Khudayr. I have read many answers on this website, and I found that some of the scholars say that there is nothing wrong with working on the basis of this degree, if the person has repented from cheating and is good at his job. We would like you to give the evidence and the basis for this view (which is that the degree or certificate does not become invalid because of cheating).","['Praise be to Allah.Cheating and deceiving are haram, whether in exams or otherwise, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever deceives [or cheats] does not belong to me.” Narrated by Muslim (102).\nThe one who has committed any such action must repent to Allah, may He be exalted.\nBut there is nothing wrong with his working on the basis of that degree, if he is good at his job, because the primary and greatest aim of stipulating that job applicants should have a degree in order to do certain jobs is to ascertain that the person is qualified to do this particular job, even on the basis of probability.\nMoreover, every boss or company which requires or stipulates that employees should have a degree is aware that some of those who have that degree may not be qualified for the job, and the way in which they obtained the degree may have involved some kind of transgression and the like, and this is something that is fairly common and well-known. But usually they initially require a degree as an indication that the person is qualified to do this job, then they watch to see how he actually performs.\nIf the person does his job in the manner that is required of him and others like him, then the purpose of stipulating that he should have a degree is fulfilled.\nIt is a waste of time and effort to seek to find out exactly how he obtained this certificate, and whether there was any transgression, cheating and the like involved. It is quite clear that this requires too much effort and it will be too difficult to establish exactly how he obtained this certificate.\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: A man got a job on the basis of a degree certificate, but he cheated in the exams for this degree. Now he is performing well, according to the testimony of his bosses. What is the ruling on his salary – is it halal or haram?\nHe replied: There is nothing wrong with it, in sha Allah, but he must repent to Allah for what he did of cheating. That is provided that he is doing his work as it should be done. In that case, there is no problem with regard to his salary, but he erred by cheating in the past, and he must repent to Allah from that.""(Majmu‘ Fatawa Ibn Baz\xa0 19/31).\nThe way to work out the ruling in such cases is to note what is mostly the case, and overlook what rarely happens. Hence we must differentiate between one who cheated in the exams and one who obtained a fake certificate.\nIf the workplace requires a particular degree, and the person obtained it by cheating in the exams, then the condition has been met and the sin that he committed may be overlooked, unlike the one who did not sit the exams and obtained a fake certificate, because that certificate carries no weight.\nSee the answer to question no. 93019 .\nIf, in addition to the fact that he is doing his work in the manner required, or he is doing it like his peers, he has also repented from transgressing and cheating, the concession of letting him off becomes stronger, because it is known that one of the objectives of sharia is helping the penitent in his repentance and forgiving what has happened in the past. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Those who consume interest cannot stand [on the Day of Resurrection] except as one stands who is being beaten by Satan into insanity. That is because they say, “Trade is [just] like interest.” But Allah has permitted trade and has forbidden interest. So whoever has received an admonition from his Lord and desists may have what is past, and his affair rests with Allah. But whoever returns to [dealing in interest or usury] - those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide eternally therein}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:275].\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThis is general in meaning and applies to everyone who has received an admonition from his Lord: Allah has ordained that he may have what is past.\nThe fact that this is proven in the case of a Muslim is supported by what it says in a subsequent verse: {O you who have believed, fear Allah and give up what remains [due to you] of interest} [al-Baqarah 2:278]. Allah enjoined them to give up what remains, but He did not enjoin them to return what they had already received. This, along with the phrase {may have what is past, and his affair rests with Allah} [in v. 275] indicates that they may keep what they had received in the past. And Allah accepts repentance from His slaves.\nIf someone were to say: This verse refers exclusively to the disbelievers,\nthe response is: There is nothing in the verse to indicate that; rather Allah says: {So whoever has received an admonition from his Lord and desists may have what is past}. Rather it is more appropriate that this should include the Muslim as well as the disbeliever.\nIn fact, it may be said that this applies to anyone who is aware that something is haram, then an admonition comes to him from his Lord, so he gives it up. Allah will forgive the one who repents on the basis of his repentance, so whatever he did in the past becomes as if it did not happen, and the verse refers to him too: {[he] may have what is past, and his affair rests with Allah}.\nThis is also indicated by the subsequent verses:\n{O you who have believed, fear Allah and give up what remains [due to you] of interest, if you should be believers.\n... But if you repent, you may have your principal}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:278-279].\nRepentance refers to both the Muslim who has sinned as well as the disbeliever [i.e., both of them may repent].(Jami‘ al-Masa’il\xa0 1/271 ff).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/279129/ruling-on-a-job-acquired-with-a-degree-for-which-there-was-some-cheating-in-the-exams
297658,I heard this on a video; how sound is it? “No one asks Allah for some worldly matter but he will get an equal amount of worries and stress.”,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nAs for this statement with this general meaning, it is undoubtedly false, for people have always asked their Lord and beseeched Him for what concerns them of some of their religious and worldly affairs.\nThere is nothing in Islamic teachings to forbid pursuing what is good in this world or to forbid striving for it.\nRather what is forbidden and blameworthy is for a person to have no concern for the hereafter and not strive for it or make any effort for it, and to have no interest in it; rather all his concern, effort and supplication have to do with this world and what it contains.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{ And when you have completed your rites, remember Allah like your [previous] remembrance of your fathers or with [much] greater remembrance. And among the people is he who says, “Our Lord, give us in this world,” and he will have in the Hereafter no share\nBut among them is he who says, “Our Lord, give us in this world [that which is] good and in the Hereafter [that which is] good and protect us from the punishment of the Fire.”\nThose will have a share of what they have earned, and Allah is swift in account}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:200-202].\nIt was narrated that Anas ibn Malik said: A man came to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and said: O Messenger of Allah, what supplication is best? He said: “Ask your Lord for pardon and wellbeing in this world and in the Hereafter.” Then (the man) came the next day and said: O Messenger of Allah, what supplication is best? He said: “Ask your Lord for pardon and for wellbeing in this world and in the Hereafter.” Then (the man) came the third day and said: O Prophet of Allah, what supplication is best? He said: “Ask your Lord for pardon and for wellbeing in this world and in the Hereafter, for if you are pardoned and granted wellbeing in this world and the Hereafter, you will have succeeded.”\nNarrated by Ibn Majah (3846) and others; classed as sahih by al-Albani.\nIt was narrated from Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) that it was said to him: Your brothers have come to you from Basra – and at that time he was in az-Zawiyah – so that you may pray to Allah for them. He said: May Allah forgive us, have mercy on us, and give us in this world that which is good and in the hereafter that which is good, and protect us from the Fire. They asked him to say more, so he said something similar, then he said: If you are granted this, then you have been granted all that is good in this world and the hereafter.\nNarrated by al-Bukhari in al-Adab al-Mufrad (633); classed as sahih by al-Albani.\nOn the contrary, this hadith definitively indicates that it is prescribed to offer supplication asking Allah for worldly matters.\nIt was narrated from ‘A’ishah that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) taught her the following supplication: “Allahumma inni as’aluka min al-khayri kullihi, ‘ajilihi wa ajilihi, ma ‘alimtu minhu wa ma lam a’lam. Wa a‘udhu bika min ash-sharri kullihi, ‘ajilihi wa ajilihi, ma ‘alimtu minhu wa ma lam a’lam. Allahumma inni as’aluka min khayri ma sa’alaka ‘abduka wa nabiyyuka, wa a‘udhu bika min sharri ma ‘adha bihi ‘abduka wa nabiyyuka. Allahumma inni as’aluka al-jannata wa ma qarraba ilayha min qawlin aw ‘amal, wa a‘udhu bika min al-naari wa ma qarraba ilayha min qawlin aw ‘amal, wa as’aluka an taj‘al kulla qadaa’in qadaytahu li khayran (O Allah, I ask You for all that is good, now and in the future, what I know of it and what I do not know. And I seek refuge with You from all evil, now and in the future, what I know and what I do not know.\xa0 O Allah, I ask You for the good that Your slave and Prophet asked You for, and I seek refuge with You from the evil from which Your slave and Prophet sought refuge. O Allah, I ask You for Paradise and for that which brings one closer to it, in word and deed, and I seek refuge in You from Hell and from that which brings one closer to it, in word and deed. And I ask You to make every decree that You decree concerning me good).”\nIt was narrated that Anas said: I came in one day and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was there, and there was no one except me, my mother, and Umm Haram, my maternal aunt. He came into our house and said to us: Shall I not lead you in prayer? And that was not at the time for any of the [five daily] prayers. A man who was present [when this hadith was narrated] said: Where did he make Anas stand? He said: He made him stand on his right, then he led us in prayer, then he offered supplication for us – the members of the household – asking for everything good in this world and the hereafter. My mother said: O Messenger of Allah, your little servant [meaning Anas]; pray to Allah for him. So he prayed for everything good for me, and at the end of his supplication he said: O Allah, grant him much wealth and many children, and bless him.\nNarrated by al-Bukhari in al-Adab al-Mufrad (88); classed as sahih by al-Albani.\nSecondly:\nWhat is blameworthy in that regard is two things:\n1. The first thing is when this world is all that a person cares about and strives for, as stated above, and he has no interest in the hereafter and does not strive for it.\nThat is when his supplication – which is one of the best ways of drawing close to Allah, and is an act of worship and one of the greatest means of attaining what one seeks – is all for worldly matters.\nIt was narrated from Ubayy ibn Ka‘b that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Give glad tidings to this ummah of prominence, victory and prevalence, so whoever among them does a deed pertaining to the hereafter for worldly gain, he will have no share in the hereafter.”\nNarrated by Ahmad (21223) and others; classed as sahih by al-Albani.\nIt was narrated that Zayd ibn Thabit (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “Whoever is focused only on this world, Allah will confound his affairs and make him fear poverty constantly, and he will not get anything of this world except that which has been decreed for him. Whoever is focused on the Hereafter, Allah will settle his affairs for him and make him feel content with his lot, and his provision and worldly gains will undoubtedly come to him.”\nNarrated by Ibn Majah (4105); classed as sahih by al-Albani.\nHence one of the supplications of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was asking Allah that this world should not be his main concern and goal.\nIt was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) rarely got up to leave a gathering before offering this supplication for his companions: “O Allah, grant us a share of fear of You that will prevent us from disobeying You, and a share of obedience and righteous deeds that will enable us to reach Your Paradise, and a share of certain faith that will enable us to bear the calamities of this world. Grant us the benefit of our hearing, sight and good health throughout our lives, and let us enjoy them until the last moment of our lives. Enable us to settle the scores with those who have wronged us, and grant us victory over those who oppose us. Do not let calamity befall us in our faith, do not let this world be our main concern or make it all that we know, and do not send against us those who will not show mercy to us.”\nNarrated by at-Tirmidhi (3502); classed as hasan by al-Albani.\n2. The second blameworthy thing is:\nwhen a person is seized by love of this world to the extent that he does not care whether he seeks worldly gain through halal means or haram.\nIt was narrated that Abu Umamah said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Jibril inspired to me that no soul will die until it has completed its allotted timespan and received its provision in full. So be moderate in seeking provision, and no one of you should let thinking that provision is slow in coming prompt him to seek it by sinful means, for what is with Allah cannot be attained except through obedience to Him”\nNarrated by Abu Nu‘aym in al-Hilyah (10/26) and others; classed as sahih by al-Albani.\nBased on these two points, being distracted by worldly concerns from the hereafter, and seeking worldly gain by whatever means are available, not caring whether they are halal or haram – this is how we should understand the warning against striving for worldly matters or praying for worldly matters.\nAbu Mu‘awiyah al-Aswad said: The one for whom this world is his main concern will suffer lengthy worry and distress in the hereafter.\nMaslamah ibn ‘Abd al-Malik said: Those who will feel the least distress in the hereafter are those who have the least worries and stress in this world.\nBoth reports were narrated by Ibn Abi’d-Dunya in Dhamm ad-Dunya (283, 284).\nConclusion: The wording mentioned in the question was not soundly narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and there is no sound report from him to suggest that it is not allowed to offer supplication for what is good in this world, so it is not correct to say that praying for what is good in this world will bring worries and stress.\nRather what has been narrated is a warning against being distracted by worldly concerns from the hereafter, or seeking worldly gains in ways that are not permissible.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/297658/does-pursuing-worldly-matters-cause-stress-and-worries
