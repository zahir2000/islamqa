432215,"When fasting, do I have to take my invisalign out while making wudu? It can retain some water. If I have to take it off when making wudu, do I have to dry it from saliva before putting it back in my mouth, since when saliva exits the mouth it breaks the fast if swallowed again.","['Praise be to Allah.After speaking with some orthodontic specialists, and direct observation of a person with clear aligners, and observing the removal and replacement of the aligners; it became apparent to us that the clear aligners retain a quantity of water during rinsing. It is also possible that water leaks \xa0into the mouth without the person realizing it.\nThis remaining quantity exceeds the excused amount, which is what remains in the mouth after rinsing, estimated at between 1 to 1.5 ml at most through clinical medical trials.\n(See: ""Al-Mufattirat At-Tibbiyyah\xa0Al-Mu`sirah,"" Dr. Abdul Razzaq Al-Kindi, p. 172).\nTherefore, since the user of the clear aligners can remove and install them alone without harm or difficulty: it is obligatory for them to remove them while fasting.\xa0\xa0They can wear them from sunset to the Fajr prayer or they can remove them after each time they rinse their mouth and empty the remaining water in them.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/432215/effect-of-invisible-aligner-on-the-fast
174432,My husband and I have frozen embryos left over from a treatment which resulted in my little boy who is nearly 2. I found out that it is not permissible to keep the frozen embryos. I was wondering whether we will be able to use the leftover embryos to do a treatment which we are looking to do as soon as possible or will we have to destroy the embryos? Please advise me.,"['Praise be to Allah.Are test-tube babies allowed in Islam?\nArtificial insemination , or what is known as test-tube babies , takes many forms, some of which are permissible and some are prohibited.\xa0\nThe permissible forms include cases in which the sperm is taken from the man and the egg is taken from his wife, and fertilization takes place externally , then the embryo is implanted in the wife’s uterus.\nIn this case, it is essential to take precautions and look for trustworthy doctors, for fear of tampering, because some doctors may use sperm that does not come from the husband when they already know that the husband’s sperm is not suitable for fertilization; and there are other problems and evil consequences that may occur.\xa0\nCan women use frozen embryos?\nIt is not permissible to keep eggs or embryos , and the fertilization of eggs must be limited to the required number so as to avoid having an excess of fertilized eggs. If there is an excess of fertilized eggs, they should be left without any care to die naturally. \xa0\nThat is because keeping embryos or eggs may lead to them being mixed with others as time goes by, either by mistake or deliberately, as has happened in many cases. Some of them may be taken and placed in the uterus of another woman , which leads to confusion of lineages, which is a serious evil that outweighs the interests which the couple may think are served by keeping embryos to save money and use for fertilization later on.\xa0\nThe Islamic Fiqh Council belonging to the Organization of the Islamic Conference has issued a statement on this matter. The text follows:\xa0\n“1-\xa0\xa0\xa0 In the light of what has happened of the possibility of keeping unfertilized eggs to be used later on, when fertilizing eggs it must be limited to the required number for implantation each time, to avoid an excess of fertilized eggs.\n2-\xa0\xa0\xa0 If there are any extra fertilized eggs – for any reason – they should be left without medical care until they die naturally.\n3-\xa0\xa0\xa0 It is prohibited to use fertilized eggs in another woman, and sufficient precautions must be taken to prevent using fertilized eggs for an illegitimate pregnancy.” (Majallat Majma` Al-Fiqh Al-Islami, issue no. 7, vol. 3, p. 563)\xa0\nBased on that, what you have to do is dispose of the frozen embryos; it is permissible for you to undergo further artificial insemination even if that is costly or difficult, because that harm cannot be compared to the possibility of embryos being mixed up, especially since this length of time has passed.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/174432/can-women-use-frozen-embryos
293857,Is breaking the fast with an odd number of dates a Sunnah from the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him)? And is eating an odd number of dates a Sunnah during Ramadan or outside of Ramadan?,"['Praise be to Allah.It is not established that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) deliberately ate an odd number of dates or recommended doing so, except on two occasions:\nThe first: Before going out for the Salah of `Eid Al-Fitr.\nAl-Bukhari (953) narrated from Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: ""The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) would not go out on the morning of `Eid Al-Fitr until he had eaten an odd number of dates.""\nThe second occasion:\nEating seven dates in the morning.\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: ""Whoever eats seven `Ajwa dates in the morning, will not be harmed by poison or magic on that day"" narrated by Al-Bukhari (5445), and Muslim (2047).\nAs for breaking the fast, it is established that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) would break his fast with fresh dates or dry dates, and it is not established that he (peace and blessings be upon him) intended a specific number or that they be an odd number.\nThe Hadith reported in this regard is weak.\nIt was narrated from Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: ""The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) liked to break his fast with three dates or something that fire had not touched."" Musnad Abu Ya`la (3305).\nThis is a weak Hadith and is not established, see: ""Silsilat Al-Ahadith Ad-Da`ifah"" by Al-Albani (966).\nSome scholars have chosen to limit this to what is established from the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) and not to expand in seeking to eat an odd number.\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n""It is not obligatory - nor even a Sunnah - that a person breaks his fast on an odd number: three, five, seven, or nine, except on the day of `Eid, `Eid Al-Fitr, as it is established ""that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) would not go out for the prayer on the day of `Eid Al-Fitr until he had eaten dates, and he would eat them in an odd number"" and other than that, the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) did not intend to eat dates in an odd number."" End quote from ""Fatawa Nur `Ala Ad-Darb"" (11/2) with numbering from Ash-Shamela.\nOther scholars have taken a broader view on this matter, citing the saying of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him): ""Indeed, Allah is Odd (Witr) and He loves odd numbers"" narrated by Al-Bukhari (6410), and Muslim (2677) from the Hadith of Abu Hurairah (may Allah be pleased with him).\n`Abd Ar-Razzaq (5/498) narrated this Hadith and then said: Ayyub said: ""Ibn Sirin used to prefer odd numbers in everything, to the extent that he would eat an odd number.""

End quote.\nWhat supports the view that it is preferred to eat an odd number of dates when breaking the fast is the action of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) in doing so on the day of `Eid, and his recommendation to eat an odd number of dates in the morning; this indicates his preference of odd numbers at the beginning of what he would break his fast with from dates and fresh dates; thus, breaking the fast from fasting is like that.\nThe matter in this regard is broad, in sha Allah; whoever chooses the odd number, based on the general evidence previously mentioned, and what is attested by the action of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) in the mentioned instances, or finds comfort in the specific Hadith reported in this regard, despite its weakness: there is no harm upon him.\nAnd whoever sees that breaking the fast on dates, fresh dates, and the like, should be however it happens, without deliberately seeking an odd number or not, due to the lack of specific proof from the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him): there is no harm upon him, and this position is also clear.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/293857/breaking-the-fast-with-an-odd-number-of-dates
222334,"What is the ruling on praying optional prayers in Ramadan? What is the number of Rak`ahs that it is prescribed to pray in Tarawih? I have seen some deviant groups, such as the Sufis and others, praying Tarawih with thirty Rak`ahs. Is there any evidence for that?","['Praise be to Allah.Offering optional prayers in Ramadan\nOffering optional prayers in Ramadan, especially voluntary night prayers (Qiyam) , comes under the heading of that which is encouraged, because of the general encouragement to do acts of worship in Ramadan, both prayers and other things, and because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) recommended praying Qiyam in Ramadan especially. He said: “Whoever prays Qiyam in Ramadan out of faith and in the hope of reward, his previous sins will be forgiven.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 37 and Muslim, 759)\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) included it in a chapter entitled: Chapter: Encouragement to pray Qiyam in Ramadan, which is Tarawih.\xa0\nSo it is encouraged for the Muslim in Ramadan to regularly offer the optional prayers both before and after the obligatory prayers, and to regularly offer Tarawih prayers in congregation with the Muslims. It is also encouraged for him to offer optional prayers in general, except at the times when doing so is disliked.\xa0\nHow Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) prayed Tarawih\nThe Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not offer more than eleven Rak`ahs [in Qiyam Al-layl], either during Ramadan or at other times, although occasionally he prayed thirteen Rak`ahs.\xa0\nAl-Bukhari (3569) and Muslim (738) narrated from Abu Salamah ibn `Abd Ar-Rahman (may Allah have mercy on him) that he asked `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her): How did the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) pray during Ramadan? She said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not pray more, in Ramadan or at any other time, than eleven Rak`ahs. He would pray four Rak`ahs, and do not ask how beautiful and long they were. Then he would pray four, and do not ask how beautiful and long they were. Then he would pray three. `A’ishah said: I said: O Messenger of Allah, do you sleep before you pray Witr? He said: “O `A’ishah, my eyes sleep but my heart does not sleep.”\xa0\nAl-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated that `A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would pray thirteen Rak`ahs at night, then he when he heard the call for Fajr prayer, he would pray two brief Rak`ahs.\xa0\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“And it is narrated from `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) in Al-Bukhari that he prayed seven or nine Rak`ahs. After that, Al-Bukhari and Muslim narrated the Hadith of Ibn `Abbas that he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would pray thirteen Rak`ahs at night, and two Rak`ahs after dawn, the Sunnah prayer of Fajr. According to the Hadith of Zayd ibn Khalid, he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would pray two brief Rak`ahs and two long ones… and he narrated the Hadith, at the end of which he said: And that was thirteen Rak`ahs.\xa0\nAl-Qadi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The scholars said: In these Hadiths, Ibn `Abbas, Zayd and `A’ishah each spoke of what they saw.”\nIs it permissible to pray 30 Rak`ahs in Tarawih?\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not specify any maximum number (of Rak`ahs) for Tarawih prayer , and the matter is broad in scope, in sha Allah.\xa0\nSo, there is nothing wrong with someone praying more than eleven Rak`ahs, because of the general meaning of the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “The night prayers are two by two, then if one of you fears that dawn may come, he should pray one Rak`ah, which will make what he has prayed odd-numbered.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 472 and Muslim, 749)\xa0\nThis is also the view of the jurists of Madhhabs (schools of jurisprudence) in various regions. According to the Hanafi Madhhab it is twenty Rak`ahs, as is also the view of Imam Ahmad. According to Imam Malik, it is thirty-six Rak`ahs, and there is nothing wrong with a person doing any of these options, or others.\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said, after mentioning the difference of opinion among the scholars concerning that:\xa0\n“The correct view is that all of that is good, as was stated by Imam Ahmad (may Allah be pleased with him), and there is no particular number with regard to Qiyam Al-layl in Ramadan. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not specify any number for that. As that is the case, one may offer more or fewer Rak`ahs, according to how long or short one wants to make the standing. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to make his standing lengthy, as it is proven from him in an authentic narration, in the Hadith of Hudhayfah (may Allah be pleased with him), that he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to recite in one Rak`ah Al-Baqarah, An-Nisa’ and Al `Imran. Making the standing lengthy suffices instead of praying a greater number of Rak`ahs. When Ubayy ibn Ka`b led them in praying Qiyam, when they were a single congregation, he would not make the standing lengthy for them, so he prayed a greater number of Rak`ahs, instead of making the standing lengthy, and they made the number of Rak`ahs double that of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), for he used to pray eleven or thirteen Rak`ahs of Qiyam Al-layl. Then after that the people in Madinah grew too weak to make the standing lengthy, so they increased the number of Rak`ahs until it reached thirty-nine.” (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 23/113; see also 23/120)\xa0\nThe scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas said:\xa0\n“No specific number has been proven with regard to the number of Rak`ahs in Tarawih prayer, and the scholars differed concerning that. Some of them think that it is twenty-three, some think it is thirty-six, some think that it is more and some think that it is less. At the time of `Umar the Companions prayed it with twenty-three Rak`ahs in the mosque of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), but the Prophet never prayed more than eleven or thirteen Rak`ahs, whether in Ramadan or otherwise, and he did not set any specific number for the people to pray in Tarawih and Qiyam Al-layl . Rather he used to urge the people to pray qiyam Al-layl and to pray Qiyam in Ramadan in particular. He (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would say: “Whoever prays Qiyam in Ramadan out of faith and in the hope of reward, his previous sins will be forgiven”, and he did not specify the number of Rak`ahs, which varies according to the nature of the standing. Whoever makes his prayer lengthy may reduce the number of Rak`ahs, as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did, and whoever makes the prayer more brief, out of kindness towards the people, may make the number of Rak`ahs greater, as the Companions did at the time of `Umar. There is nothing wrong with increasing the number of Rak`ahs in the last ten nights of Ramadan, making it greater than in the first twenty nights, and dividing them into two sections, one to be offered at the beginning of the night and made brief, like Tarawih in the first twenty nights, and another section to be offered at the end of the night and made lengthy, to be regarded as Tahajjud. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to pray Tahajjud in the last ten nights as he never did at any other time.” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, vol. 2, 6/82)\nIn conclusion, there is no specific number of Rak`ahs for Tarawih prayer, such that it is not allowed to do more or less than that. Whoever prays Tarawih with thirty Rak`ahs, or more or less than that, there is no blame on him, and he is not innovating by doing that.\xa0\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“There is no specific number for Tarawih prayer . Whoever prays twenty, there is nothing wrong with that; whoever prays thirty, there is nothing wrong with that; whoever prays forty, there is nothing wrong with that; whoever prays eleven, there is nothing wrong with that; whoever prays thirteen, there is nothing wrong with that; and whoever prays more or less than that, there is nothing wrong with that. The matter is broad in scope.” (Fatawa Nur `Ala Ad-Darb (9/437)\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/222334/is-it-permissible-to-pray-30-rakahs-in-tarawih
