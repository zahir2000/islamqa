145166,"Does the commentary on the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {Does he not know that Allah sees} [al-‘Alaq 96:14] indicate that Allah has eyes? If that is not the case, then does Allah have eyes? Is there any proven evidence to that effect?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe way of Ahl as-Sunnah wa’l-Jama‘ah is to affirm the divine attribute of eyes in a manner that is befitting to Him, as He, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the Hearing, the Seeing}\xa0[ash-Shura 42:11].\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The view of Ahl as-Sunnah wa’l-Jama‘ah is that Allah has two eyes with which He sees in a real sense in a manner that is befitting to Him; this is one of the attributes of His Essence.""(Majmu‘ Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthyamin\xa0 4/58).\nSecondly:\nThe texts of the Qur’an and Sunnah affirm the divine attribute of eyes.\nWith regard to evidence from the Qur’an:\n-1-\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And construct the ship under Our watchful eyes and Our inspiration}\xa0[Hud 11:37].\nIt was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said regarding the verse {And construct the ship under Our watchful eyes and Our inspiration} [Hud 11:37]: This refers to the eye of Allah, may He blessed and exalted. This was narrated from him by al-Bayhaqi in al-Asma’ wa’s-Sifat (2/116).\nIbn Jarir at-Tabari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The words {under Our watchful eyes} mean: under the eye of Allah and in accordance His revealed instructions to you.

Indeed Allah is not one-eyed” – and he pointed to his eye – “but the false messiah the Dajjal is one-eyed; his right eye is like a floating grape.”\nIbn Khuzaymah (may Allah have mercy on him) said, after mentioning the texts quoted above: It is obligatory for every believer to affirm for his Creator and Maker what the Creator and Maker affirmed for Himself of eyes. He is not a true believer who denies for Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, what He has affirmed for Himself in a clear text and was explained by the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), to whom Allah gave the task of explaining His words, as He said (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And We revealed to you the message that you may make clear to the people what was sent down to them}\xa0[an-Nahl 16:44].\nSo the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) explained that Allah has two eyes, and his explanation was in accordance with the revealed text, which you find in the pages of the Mushaf and it is recited by the imams in prayer and is taught to children in the schools.""(Kitab at-Tawhid\xa0 1/64).\nWith regard to the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {Does he not know that Allah sees} [al-‘Alaq 96:14], this does not prove the divine attribute of the eyes; rather it affirms the divine attribute of vision and sight. As for affirmation of His eyes, that is a separate issue concerning which you may refer to the texts which speak of it.\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Did the one who forbids the guided to pray not know that Allah sees him and hears his words, and will requite him in full for his actions?""(Tafsir Ibn Kathir\xa0 4/646).\nAl-Bayhaqi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {Does he not know that Allah sees} [al-‘Alaq 96:14] is one of the verses which affirm His vision and sight.""(Al-Asma’ wa’s-Sifat\xa01/461).\nShaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The eye of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, is a real eye. The evidence for that is the fact that Allah Himself has affirmed that in more than one place, and He has affirmed that He sees in more than one place, so He has affirmed one of them sometimes and the other one sometimes, which indicates that they are two different things. So His sight is one thing and His eye is something else. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And say, “Do [as you will], for Allah will see your deeds, and [so, will] His Messenger…”}\xa0[at-Tawbah 9:105]\n{Does he not know that Allah sees?}\xa0[al-‘Alaq 96:14].\nThese two verses are about His sight.\nBut the verses in which He says: {Sailing under Our watchful eyes} [al-Qamar 54:14] and {that you would be brought up under My eye} [Ta-Ha 20:39] are not about His sight; rather they affirm that He has eyes, as opposed to seeing. Hence we say that the eye is a real divine attribute.""(Sharh al-‘Aqidah as-Safariniyyah).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/145166/evidence-which-affirms-the-divine-attribute-of-the-eye

But due to technological advisement it is very hard to draw line between halal or haram so I want you to give Fitwa specifically for this case. I live in New Zealand. Uber has started food delivery service here recently. It is good job as a delivery person because you can work on your own convenience. The restaurants/takeaways on the panel are Halal, non-Halal & vegetarian. It works on the following principles Switch on the app. on your mobile when you are ready/available. A pop-op message will appear on the screen that a meal order is xx min way (xx min is time to reach a restaurant from your current location). When you accept the request then you can see the Restaurant name and address. But once you accept the order, you can’t decline unless your car is broken or in an accident. Once you reach the restaurant and tell your order number, you will be given a sealed bag (you don’t know the contents). After receiving the bag, delivery address appears on the App. My question is that delivering the food for UberEAT is halal or not in the following circumstances You don’t know that from where you will pick the food unless you accept an order and you never get to know what is inside the packet (food/beverages/drinks).","['Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to work in delivering prohibited food such as that which contains pork or the meat of animals that were not slaughtered in the prescribed manner, or alcohol, because that comes under the heading of helping in sin. The wages earned from doing that are also prohibited. Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And cooperate in righteousness and piety, but do not cooperate in sin and aggression. And fear Allah; indeed, Allah is severe in penalty.” [Al-Ma’idah 5:2]\nIt says in Sharh Muntaha Al-Iradat (2/250):\xa0\n“It is not valid to be hired to deliver “dead meat” (from an animal that was not slaughtered in the prescribed manner) and similar things, such as prohibited blood, to be eaten, for one who is not compelled to eat that; or to deliver alcohol to get drunk, for the reasons mentioned above, and the one who does that is not entitled to any wages for doing it, because prohibited service cannot be paid for.\nBut if the improperly-slaughtered meat is being delivered to someone who has no choice but to eat it, then it is valid.”\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “If someone helps a man to disobey Allah, then he is sinning, because he is helping in sin and transgression. Hence the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) cursed alcohol, the one who presses (the grapes et cetera), the one for whom they are pressed, the one who carries it, the one to whom it is carried, the one who sells it, the one who buys it, the one who pours it, the one who drinks it, and the one consumes its price. Most of those mentioned, such as the one who presses it, the one who carries it and the one who pours it, are helping the drinker to drink it. Hence it is forbidden to sell weapons to those who will use them to fight in unlawful ways, such as fighting the Muslims or infighting among Muslims (fitnah).” (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 22/141)\nSince when doing the work mentioned it is not clear what type of food is being delivered, then this work is not permissible, because you are living in a non-Muslim country, where the people usually eat pork and drink alcohol.\nFor more details, please refer to the following answers: 49694 , 172 , 96739 , 40651 , 245688 , and 10339 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/281148/is-it-prohibited-to-deliver-non-halal-food
246650,"I have a business venture, and I want to find out whether the way I am doing this transaction is permissible, because I researched the issue of salam transaction (payment in advance for delivery later on) and istisna‘ (contract to have something made or done) and selling something that one does not possess, but I do not know which ruling my venture comes under. My business idea is as follows: 1/ I design something with the cooperation of more than one party, on the basis that the other parties will share the profits in return for working with me. 2/ I send the design to a company that prints designs on clothing. 3/ I get one sample of the product printed. 4/ I show a picture of the sample product on the Internet, with specifications and dimensions. 5/ The customer sees the product on the Internet. 6/ The customer sends an order to us, with full payment covering the cost of the product + profit and shipping costs, and we tell the customer how long it will take to make and send it: between 5-10 days, depending on the manufacturing and shipping companies. 7/ After that, I will send the order to the printing company and pay the costs of the product, after deducting the profit. 8/ After producing the item, the company will send it to the customer; in other words I do not own the item of clothing; rather I show one sample that was made, which came into my ownership, and the manufacturing company that I deal with is the one who supplies any additional orders. My question is: is my way of doing business acceptable according to Islam?","['Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with doing business in this way, as it is a contract to supply a manufactured product, so it comes under the rulings on istisna‘ (contract to have something made or done), and it is permissible for the customer to pay the price in full at the time of making the contract, or to pay in instalments.\nThe International Islamic Fiqh Council belonging to the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, during its twelfth session in Riyadh, in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, 25 Jumada al-Akhirah – 1 Rajab 1421 AH/23-28 September 2000 CE, issued a statement regarding supply contracts, in which they said:\n…\xa0 Secondly: if the product mentioned in the supply contract needs to be manufactured, then the contract is istisna‘ (contract to have something made or done) and subject to the relevant rulings. A statement no. 65 (3/7) has been issued regarding istisna‘.\nThirdly: if the product mentioned in the supply contract does not need to be manufactured, and its qualities and specifications are known, then it must be delivered at the agreed time. This may be done in one of two ways:\n1.. The customer requesting the product pays in full at the time of drawing up the contract. In that case, it is a contract that comes under the rulings on salam transaction (payment in advance), in which case it is permissible, subject to the conditions stipulated in Islamic teachings, which are explained in the Council’s statement no. 85 (2/9).\n2.. The customer requesting the product does not pay in full at the time of drawing up the contract. In that case, it is not permissible, because it is based on a mutual promise between both parties, and the council’s statements nos. 40 and 41 state that a mutual promise looks like a business contract but it is invalid, because it is like selling a debt for a debt.\nBut if the promise is not binding on one or both parties, then it is permissible, provided that the sale is done with a new contract or by delivery.
