129888,"I read some hadiths about the formation of the foetus, which Ibn al-Qayyim quoted in his book at-Tibyan fi Aqsam al-Quran. He said that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If the man’s water precedes the woman’s water, the foetus will be male, and if the woman’s water precedes the man’s water, then the foetus will be female…” Then he quoted another hadith, according to which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was asked from what man is created, and he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) replied: “From the water of the man and the woman together. From the man’s water the bones and sinews are created because it is thick and from the woman’s water the blood and flesh are created because it is soft.” Can you explain this idea in the light of these two hadiths?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe second hadith quoted in the question is not sahih. Its wording, and the views of leading scholars concerning it, follow:\nIt was narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: A Jewish man passed by the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) when he was talking to his companions. Quraysh said: O Jew, this man claims that he is a prophet. The Jewish man said: I shall ask him about something which no one knows except a prophet. So he came and sat down, then he said: O Muhammad, from what is man created? He said: “O Jew, [he is created] from both, from the water of the man and the water of the woman. As for the water of the man, it is thick and from it [come] the bones and sinews; as for the water of the woman, it is thin and from it [come] the flesh and blood.” The Jewish man stood up and said: This is what those who came before you said.\nNarrated by Ahmad in his Musnad (7/437).\nShaykh Ahmad Shakir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIts isnad is weak (da‘if), because of the weakness of Husayn ibn al-Hasan, who is al-Ashqar. The hadith is in Majma‘ az-Zawa’id (8/241). And he said: It was narrated by Ahmad, at-Tabarani and al-Bazzar with two isnads. One of its isnads includes ‘Amir ibn Mudrik, whom Ibn Hibban regarded as trustworthy (thiqah), but others regarded him as weak. The rest of its narrators are trustworthy. The isnad of the group includes ‘Ata’ ibn as-Sa’ib, who at some point became confused and forgetful.\nMusnad Ahmad, annotated by Shaykh Ahmad Shakir (6/199).\nIt was also classed as weak by the commentators on al-Musnad (7/437, ar-Risalah edn.), who said:\nIts isnad is weak (da‘if) because of the weakness of Husayn ibn al-Hasan, who is al-Ashqar, and ‘Ata ibn as-Sa’ib, who became confused and forgetful at the end of his life. We have not come across anything to indicate whether Abu Kudaynah – who is Yahya ibn al-Muhallab – heard it from him before or after he became confused. Regarding ‘Abd ar-Rahman, the father of al-Qasim – who is the son of ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud – it is not proven that he heard this hadith from his father, because he only heard a few hadiths from his father. End quote.\nIn addition to the isnad of this hadith being weak (da’if), there is also a problem with its text, as it says that the flesh of the foetus is formed from the water of the mother and its bones are formed from the water of the father. The apparent meaning of the religious texts is that the flesh and bones are formed from both waters together.\nThe commentators on al-Musnad narrated from Nur ad-Din Abu’l-Hasan as-Sindi (may Allah have mercy on him) that he said:\nRegarding the words “as for the water of the woman, it is thin and from it [come] the flesh and blood,” I say: The apparent meaning of the Quran – namely the verse (interpretation of the meaning): {Then We made the sperm-drop into a clinging clot, and We made the clot into a lump [of flesh], and We made [from] the lump, bones, and We covered the bones with flesh; then We developed him into another creation} [al-Mu’minun 23:14] – indicates that the two waters together become bones. End quote.\nSecondly: Regarding the creation of the foetus, whether it will be male or female, and whether it will resemble the father or the mother, all of these are issues for which there are indications in the Quran and Sunnah, and there is a difference of scholarly opinion regarding that. We may outline it in brief as follows:\n-1-\nCreation of the foetus\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{So let man observe from what he was created.\nHe was created from a fluid, ejected,\nEmerging from between the backbone and the ribs}\xa0[At-Tariq 86:5-7].\nThe scholars differed regarding the meaning of this verse. We have discussed their difference of opinion in the answer to question no. 118879 .\nWe think that what is most likely to be correct is the view of a group of commentators and scholars who said that the “backbone (as-sulb)” – which is the spine – and the “ribs (at-tara’ib)” – which are the bones of the chest – refer to the man himself.\n-2-\nBecoming male or female, and resembling either parent\nThere is a great deal of dispute among earlier and contemporary scholars regarding this matter. We will quote a number of hadiths which speak of the issue, then we will quote the most famous comments of the scholars regarding them.\ni.\nIt was narrated from Anas that ‘Abdullah ibn Salam asked the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): Why does the child resemble its father or its mother? The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Jibril has informed me of that just now. As for the child, if the man’s water precedes the woman’s water, the child will resemble him, but if the woman’s water precedes the man’s water, the child will resemble her.” ‘Abdullah ibn Salam said: I bear witness that there is no god worthy of worship except Allah and that you are the Messenger of Allah. Narrated by al-Bukhari (3723).\nWhat is meant by “resemble him” is that he will look like him.\nii.\nIt was narrated that Thawban, the freed slave of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: I was standing beside the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) when one of the Jewish rabbis came and said: I have come to ask you about the child. He said: “The water of the man is white and the water of the woman is yellow.\xa0 If they meet and the water of the man prevails over the water of the woman, it will be a male, by Allah\'s leave. If the water of the woman prevails over the water of the man, it will be a female, by Allah’s leave.” The Jew said: You have spoken the truth. Narrated by Muslim (315).\niii.\nIt was narrated from Umm Sulaym that she asked the Prophet of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) about a woman who sees in her dreams what a man sees (that, an erotic dream). The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If a woman sees that (that is, wetness), let her do ghusl.” Umm Salamah said: I felt shy because of that and I said: Does that really happen? The Prophet of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “How else does resemblance (of the child to either parent) happen? The water of the man is thick and white, and the water of the woman is thin and yellow. Whichever of them prevails, or comes first, the resemblance will be (to that parent).” Narrated by Muslim (311).\niv.\nIt was narrated from ‘A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that a woman said to the Messenger of Allah: Should a woman do ghusl if she has an erotic dream and sees water? He said: “Yes… Can the resemblance (of the child to either parent) come except through that? If her water prevails over that of the man, then the child will resemble his maternal uncles, and if the man’s water prevails over hers, then he will resemble his paternal uncles.” Narrated by Muslim (314).\nHere we will quote two scholarly views regarding the meaning of the hadiths quoted above, and the salient point here is the meaning of the words “precedes/comes before” and “prevails.”\n-a-\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf one of the two waters comes before the other, that will cause the child to resemble the parent whose water comes first. If one of the two waters prevails over the other, that will cause the child to be of the same gender as the parent whose water prevailed. So here we have two issues: preceding or coming before, and prevailing. Both may happen for one parent, or one will happen for one parent and the other will happen for the other parent. If the water of the man precedes the water of the woman and prevails over it, then the child will be male and will resemble the father. If the water of the woman precedes the water of the man and prevails over it, then the child will female and will resemble the mother. If one of them comes first and the other prevails, then the child will resemble the parent whose water came first, and will be male or female according to which parent’s water prevails.""(Tuhfat al-Mawdud bi Ahkam al-Mawlud\xa0 p. 278).\n-b-\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nMuslim narrated from ‘A’ishah: “If the man’s water prevails over the woman’s water, the child will resemble his paternal uncles, and if the woman’s water prevails over the man’s water, the child will resemble his maternal uncles.” A similar report was narrated by al-Bazzar from Ibn Mas‘ud, in which it says: “The man’s water is white and thick and the woman’s water is yellow and thin. Whichever of them prevails, the child will resemble that parent.” What is meant by prevailing is coming first, because everything which comes first becomes dominant, so it prevails in a metaphoric sense.\nAs for what was narrated by Muslim in the marfu‘ hadith of Thawban, that “The water of the man is white and the water of the woman is yellow.\xa0 If they meet and the water of the man prevails over the maniy of the woman, it will be a male, by Allah\'s leave. If the water of the woman prevails over the maniy of the man, it will be a female, by Allah’s leave,” there is a problem with this report, which is that it implies that the child will inevitably resemble the paternal uncles if the father’s water prevails, and the same time the child will be male and not female, and vice versa. But what we see in real life is different, because the child may be male and resemble his maternal uncles, not his paternal uncles, and vice versa. Al-Qurtubi said: We must understand the hadith of Thawban on the basis that what is meant by prevailing is coming first. I say: What appears to be the case is what I noted above, which is that we may interpret prevailing as mentioned in the hadith of ‘A’ishah in a different way. As for the hadith of Thawban, prevailing may be understood in accordance with its apparent meaning, so preceding or coming first is what will determine whether the child is male or female, and prevailing is what will determine whether the child resembles the mother or the father. Thus the problem is resolved. It is as if what is meant by that prevailing which determines who the child resembles is being greater in size and volume, so that the water of the other one is overwhelmed and absorbed, and this determines who the child resembles. That may be divided into six categories:\n\nWhen the man’s water comes first and is greater in quantity, so the child will be male and resemble the father.\nThe opposite of that.\nWhen the man’s water comes first, but the woman’s water is greater in quantity, so the child will be male but will resemble the mother.\nThe opposite of that.\nWhen the man’s water comes first, but the two waters are equal in volume, so the child will be male, but will not resemble either parent.\nThe opposite of that.\n\nFath al-Bari (7/273).\nTo sum up the above:\n\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said, explaining the meaning of “coming first/preceding” and “prevailing” that whichever of the two waters comes first, the child will resemble the parent whose water comes first, and the prevailing of one of them will determine whether the child is male or female.\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) was of the view that whichever water comes first determines whether the child will be male or female, and whichever prevails determines who the child resembles.\n\nThe matter is open to possibilities. Perhaps modern medical facts – not theories – will lend support to one of the two views.

47889,Is there a set limit to a trader’s profits?,"['Praise be to Allah.There is no set limit to which a trader must adhere in the profits he makes on his business, but if the goods have a known market value, it is not permissible for him to cheat the buyer by selling goods to him for more than the usual market value and taking advantage of his ignorance.\xa0\nThis is indicated by the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Do not meet incoming traders and whoever meets them and buys from them, when the trader reaches the marketplace he has the choice (of annulling the transaction).” (Narrated by Muslim, 1519)\xa0\nIslam gives the trader the choice, when he reaches the marketplace, because the one who met him probably cheated him and bought from him at a price other than the market value. If he finds that this is the case, then he may either go ahead with the deal, or cancel it.\xa0\nThe point in this Hadith is that it is forbidden to meet those traders on the way because of the deceit involved and because they are not being given the proper market price.\xa0\nThe Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas was asked: Are profits limited in Islam, and if that is the case, what is the highest limit? If there is no limit, how do you explain that?\xa0\nThey replied:\n“There is no limit to profits in trading , rather the matter is subject to supply and demand. But it is good for the Muslim, whether he is a trader or not, to be easy going in buying and selling, and not to exploit the opportunity of his counterpart’s carelessness to cheat him in buying and selling. Rather he should pay attention to the rights of his Muslims brothers.” ( Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 13/91)\nThey were also asked: Is it permissible for a trader to earn more than 10% on his goods?\xa0\nThey replied:\xa0\n“The trader’s earnings are not restricted to a specific amount according to Shari`ah, but it is not permissible for a Muslim to cheat those who buy from him or to sell for anything other than the known market value. It is prescribed for the Muslim not to go to extremes in seeking profits but rather to be easy going when he buys and when he sells, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) urged forbearance in all dealings.” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 13/92)\nFor more details, please refer t o the following answers: 13973 and 97599 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/47889/how-much-profit-is-allowed-in-islam
31172,"Is it permissible to join Dhuhr and `Asr prayers, or Maghrib and `Isha’, when it is raining?","['Praise be to Allah.Can you combine prayers because of rain?\nThere is a concession allowing Maghrib and `Isha’ prayers to be joined at the time of Maghrib, with one Adhan and an Iqamah for each of them, when there is rain that soaks people’s clothes, when going back to the mosque for `Isha’ will cause hardship. This is according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions.\xa0\nSimilarly it is permissible to join them when it is very muddy, according to the correct scholarly view, so as to avoid hardship and difficulty. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“and has not laid upon you in religion any hardship.” [Al-Hajj 22:78]\xa0\n“Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope.” [Al-Baqarah 2:286]\nAban ibn ‘Uthman (may Allah be pleased with him) joined Maghrib and `Isha’ on rainy nights , when there was a group of senior scholars from among the Tabi`in, and it is not known that any of them objected, so that meant there was consensus.\xa0\nThat was mentioned by Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) in Al-Mughni. “It is also allowed for a person who is very sick to join Dhuhr and `Asr at the time of either of them, depending on what is easier for him, and he can join Maghrib and `Isha’ likewise, so as to avoid hardship.” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah li’l-Buhuth Al-‘Ilmiyyah wa’l-Ifta’, 8/135)\xa0\nDo we join prayers because of rain in the mosque or at home?\nIf it is asked: do we join prayers because of rain in the mosque or at home? The answer is:\xa0\nWhat is prescribed is for the people who pray in the mosque to join their prayers if there is a reason that justifies joining them, such as rain, so as to attain the reward of praying in congregation whilst also being kind to the people. This is what it says in the authentic Hadiths.\xa0\nWith regard to joining the prayers at home for the reason mentioned, that is not permissible because it is not narrated in Shari`ah and there is no excuse that would permit joining the prayers .”\xa0(Fataawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah li’l-Buhuth Al-‘Ilmiyyah wa’l-Ifta’, 8/134)']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/31172/is-combining-maghrib-and-isha-when-raining-allowed
405707,"Is constantly praying for forgiveness a means of receiving a response from Allah, may He be exalted, to a person’s supplication?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nBy His kindness and mercy, Allah, may He be exalted, answers people’s supplications, as He, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And your Lord says, “Call upon Me; I will respond to you.” Indeed, those who disdain My worship will enter Hell [rendered] contemptible}\xa0[Ghafir 40:60]\n{And [mention] Noah, when he called [to Allah] before [that time], so We responded to him and saved him and his family from the great flood}\xa0[Al-Anbiya’ 21:76]\n{And [mention] Job, when he called to his Lord, “Indeed, adversity has touched me, and you are the Most Merciful of the merciful.”\nSo We responded to him and removed what afflicted him of adversity. And We gave him [back] his family and the like thereof with them as mercy from Us and a reminder for the worshippers [of Allah]}\xa0[Al-Anbiya’ 21:83-84].\nIt was narrated from ‘Ubadah ibn as-Samit that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no Muslim on earth who calls upon Allah in supplication but Allah will grant it to him, or avert an equivalent evil from him, so long as his supplication does not involve sin or severing ties of kinship.” A man among the people said: Then I will offer a great deal of supplication. He said: “Allah will grant more.” Narrated by at-Tirmidhi (3573); he said: This hadith is hasan sahih, and gharib with this isnad.\nIt was narrated from Abu Sa‘id that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no Muslim who offers supplication in which there is no sin or severing ties of kinship, but Allah will grant him one of three things in response to it: either He will hasten for him what he asked for, or He will store it for him in the hereafter, or He will avert an equivalent evil from him.”\nThey said: Then we will offer a great deal of supplication. He said: “Allah will grant more.” Narrated by Imam Ahmad in al-Musnad (17/213). Shaykh al-Albani said: It is hasan sahih, as noted in Sahih at-Targhib wa’t-Tarhib (2/278).\nSecondly:\nThere are places and times in which a person is more likely to receive a response to his supplication. We have listed some of them in the answer to question no. 22438. They include:\n\nSupplication on Laylat al-Qadr.\nSupplication in the last part of the night.\nSupplication when in prostration.\nSupplication between the adhan and iqamah.\nSupplication at the time of the adhan for the prescribed prayers, and when the Muslim army engages the enemy in battle.\nSupplication of one who is oppressed.\nSupplication after the sun has passed the meridian, before Zuhr.\n\nThirdly:\nPrayer for forgiveness (istighfar) brings great benefits which it is good for the Muslim to learn about. In the Book of Allah, may He be exalted, Hud said to his people (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And O my people, ask forgiveness of your Lord and then repent to Him. He will send [rain from] the sky upon you in showers and increase you in strength [added] to your strength. And do not turn away, persisting in wickedness.\nO my people, seek the forgiveness of your Lord and repent to Him; He will send down upon you abundant rain from the sky, and will add strength to your strength. So do not turn away in sin}\xa0[Hud 11:52].\nAnd before him, Nuh said (interpretation of the meaning):\n{He will send [rain from] the sky upon you in [continuing] showers,\nAnd give you increase in wealth and children and provide for you gardens and provide for you rivers}\xa0[Nuh 71:11-12].\nWe have mentioned in the answers to questions no. 39775\xa0and 104919 the virtue and benefits of praying for forgiveness.\nPraying for forgiveness makes it more likely that the believer will receive a response to his supplication in several ways:\n1.. Praying for forgiveness erases sins, which makes a person closer to Allah, may He be exalted, and being close to Allah is one of the means of receiving a response to supplication.\nIbn al-Qayyim said: I said to Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) one day: One of the scholars was asked: Which is more beneficial to a person, glorifying Allah (tasbih) or praying for forgiveness (istighfar)? He said: If the garment is clean, then bukhur (incense) and rosewater are better for it, and if it is dirty, then soap and hot water are better for it. Then he (may Allah have mercy on him) said to me: What about if the garment is still dirty?""(Al-Wabil as-Sayyib\xa0 1/233).\n2.. Praying for forgiveness is one of the means of increasing provision, and supplication and the response to it are provision from Allah, may He be glorified and praised.\nIbn Taymiyah said: I would have an issue or a problem that I found difficult to find an answer to, so I would ask Allah, may He be exalted, for forgiveness one thousand times, or more or less, until I felt at ease and found an answer to the issue or problem that was on my mind.""(Al-‘Uqud ad-Duriyyah fi Manaqib Ibn Taymiyah\xa0 p. 10).\nFourthly:\nWhat supports the idea that praying a great deal for forgiveness is one of the means of receiving a response to one’s supplication is the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him):\n“The supplication of Dhun-Noon which he offered when he was in the belly of the fish: ‘La ilaha illa anta, subhanaka, inni kuntu min az-zalimin (There is no god worthy of worship except You; exalted are You. I have indeed done wrong’ [al-Anbiya’ 21:87]. No Muslim calls upon his Lord with it for anything but he will receive a response.”\nNarrated by Ahmad (1462) and al-Tirmidhi (3505).\nAl-Qurtubi said, commenting on the passage,\n{And [mention] the man of the fish, when he went off in anger and thought that We would not decree [anything] upon him. And he called out within the darknesses, “There is no god worthy of worship except You; exalted are You. I have indeed done wrong.”\nSo We responded to him and saved him from the distress. And thus do We save the believers}\xa0[Al-Anbiya’ 21:87-88]:\nIn this verse, Allah promises the one who calls upon Him in supplication that He will respond, as He responded to Dhu’n-Nun and that He will save him as He saved Dhu’n-Nun; that promise is { And thus do We save the believers }.""(Al-Jami‘ li Ahkam al-Qur’an\xa0 11/334).\nThat is because his supplication combines all types of Tawhid:\n\nAffirmation of the oneness of Allah, may He be blessed and exalted.\nDeclaring Him to be far above any injustice, because His justice and wisdom are perfect.\nAcknowledging his sin.\nObserving proper etiquette when asking, as he [Dhu’n-Nun] did not ask of Allah, may He be exalted, by means of a clear statement; rather he only hinted at his situation. End quote.\n\nSee: Sharh ad-Du‘a’ min al-Kitab wa’s-Sunnah (p. 81).\nFor more information, please see the answer\xa0to question\xa0no. 318430 .\nThis idea is also confirmed by what al-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) mentioned when he said: This verse and the verse in Surat Hud indicate that prayer for forgiveness is a means by which provision and rain may come down.\nAsh-Sha‘bi said: ‘Umar went out to pray for rain, and he did no more than pray for forgiveness before he came back, then it rained. They said: We did not see you pray for rain. He said: I have indeed prayed for rain by words which are the stirrers-up of rain. Then he recited the words (interpretation of the meaning):\n{ And said, ‘Ask forgiveness of your Lord. Indeed, He is ever a Perpetual Forgiver.\nHe will send [rain from] the sky upon you in [continuing] showers}\xa0[Nuh 71:10-11].\nAl-Awza‘i said: The people went out to pray for rain, and Bilal ibn Sa‘d stood up to address them. He praised and glorified Allah, then he said: O Allah, we have heard Your words (interpretation of the meaning) {There is not upon the doers of good any cause [for blame]} [at-Tawbah 9:91]. We admit our wrongdoing, and Your forgiveness is not for anyone except people like us. O Allah, forgive us, have mercy on us, and grant us rain. He raised his hands and the people raised their hands, then it rained.\nIbn Subayh said: A man complained to al-Hasan of drought, and he said to him: Ask Allah for forgiveness. Another man complained to him of poverty, and he said to him: Ask Allah for forgiveness. Another man said to him: Pray to Allah to bless me with a child. He said to him: Ask Allah for forgiveness. Another man complained to him that his garden was dry, and he said to him: Ask Allah for forgiveness. We asked him about that, and he said: I was not speaking of my own accord. Allah, may He be exalted, says in Surat Nuh (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Ask forgiveness of your Lord. Indeed, He is ever a Perpetual Forgiver.\nHe will send [rain from] the sky upon you in [continuing] showers\nAnd give you increase in wealth and children and provide for you gardens and provide for you rivers}\xa0[Nuh 71:10-12].\nAnd we have already seen in Surat Al ‘Imran how to seek forgiveness, and that that should be done with sincerity and giving up sins. This is the most important means of receiving a response.""(Tafsir al-Qurtubi\xa0 18/302-303).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/405707/impact-of-prayer-for-forgiveness-istighfar-on-receiving-a-response-to-supplication-dua
21662,Is it permissible for a worshipper to put his shoes in front of him as a Sutrah?,"['Praise be to Allah.What can be used as Sutrah?\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (May Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“It is permissible for a worshipper to use anything as a Sutrah [an object placed in front of him to “screen” him whilst he is praying], even if it is an arrow. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When any one of you prays, let him place a Sutrah for his prayer, even if it is an arrow.” (Narrated by Ahmad, 14916; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in As-Silsilah As-Sahihah, 2783)\xa0\nThe scholars even said:\xa0 “He can screen himself with a thread or the edge of the rug. Indeed it says in the Hadith that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said whoever cannot find a stick, let him draw a line, as it says in the Hadith of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When any one of you prays, let him face towards something, and if he cannot find anything, let him use a stick, and if he does not have a stick, let him draw a line, then it will not matter whatever passes in front of him .” (Narrated by Imam Ahmad. Ibn Hajar said in Bulugh Al-Maram: Those who said that this Hadith is inauthentic are incorrect; rather it is sound.”\xa0\nAll of this indicates that the Sutrah does not have to be big, rather it is sufficient for it to be something that indicates that it is serving as a screen.\xa0\nIs it permissible to put shoes as Sutrah?\nThere is no doubt that shoes are big and three dimensional, but I think that they should not be used as a Sutrah , because shoes are customarily regarded as dirty, and you should not have them in front of you, when you are standing before Allah . Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade worshippers to spit in front of them so that the sputum would be in front of them, and he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “For Allah is in front of him [the worshipper].” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 406) (Fatawa Ibn `Uthaymin, 13/326)\xa0\nFor more details, please refer to the following answers: 118153 , 13700 , 117758 , and 126664 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21662/can-you-pray-with-shoes-in-front-of-you-as-sutrah
