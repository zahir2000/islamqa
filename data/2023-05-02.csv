219157,"I would like to know how the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) cleaned himself with water (istinja’) after relieving himself, especially after urinating. Are there any reports in the Sunnah about that? Did he pour water on himself, or did he take water in his hand and wipe? What is the correct way? And how much water should be used to do as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did? And how did he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) purify his hand afterwards?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade extravagance in all things, and he was economical in his use of water when purifying himself; he would not use too much of it, to the extent that he would do wudu’ with a mudd of water, as Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said. Narrated by Muslim (325).\nA mudd is the amount of water that can be held in the two cupped hands of a man of average build.\nSimilarly, he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was not extravagant in his use of water when he cleaned himself after relieving himself (istinja’); he did not use any more than necessary, which is the amount needed to remove the impurities from the place.\nPlease see the answer\xa0to question\xa0no. 171285 \xa0.\nSecondly:\nIt was the practice of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), if he needed to clean himself after relieving himself, or to remove any dirt, to do that directly with his left hand.\nAbu Dawud (33) narrated that ‘A’ishah said: The right hand of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was for his wudu’ and food, and his left hand was for cleaning himself after relieving himself and removing any dirt.\nClassed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud.\nAl-Bukhari (265) and Muslim (317) narrated that Ibn ‘Abbas said: Maymunah said: I brought water to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to do ghusl with it. He poured water on his hands and washed each one two or three times, then he scooped water with his right hand onto his left hand and he washed his private parts. Then he rubbed his hand on the ground – according to one report: then he rubbed his hand on the ground, or on the wall. –\xa0\nSo if he was able to scoop water from the vessel with his right hand and wash with his left hand, he did that.\nAl-Bukhari (150) and Muslim (271) narrated that Anas ibn Malik said: When the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) went out to relieve himself, another boy and myself would bring a vessel of water, meaning for him to clean himself with it.\nThe word translated here as vessel refers to a small leather vessel that is used to carry water, as is stated in Fath al-Bari by Ibn Hajar (1/76).\nIbn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf the water was in a small leather vessel and the like, he would pour the water from it onto his private part.""(Fath al-Bari by Ibn Rajab\xa0 1/276).\nThirdly:\nWhen the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came out of the place where he went to relieve himself, he would rub his hand on the ground, as noted above in the hadith of Maymunah, then he would “wash his private parts. Then he rubbed his hand on the ground.”\nAn-Nasa’i (50) narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did wudu’, and when he cleaned himself after relieving himself, he rubbed his hand on the ground. Classed as hasan by al-Albani in Sahih an-Nasa’i.\nThis action is clear and the meaning is understandable; it was in order to remove anything that may have got stuck on the hand as a result of cleaning oneself, such as dirt or an unpleasant odour. Hence Imam al-Bukhari included it in a chapter entitled: Wiping the hand with dust to clean it. End quote.\nIt says in ‘Awn al-Ma‘bud (1/44):\nIn order to remove an unpleasant odour, if it remains after washing the hand. End quote.\nIf the individual washes his hands with soap and the like, which will remove such traces, this is similar to rubbing it on the ground, or maybe better.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIt is recommended for the one who has cleaned himself with water, after he has finished, to clean his hand with dust or potash, or to rub it with dust or on the wall, to remove any off-putting traces from it. End quote from Sharh Muslim (3/231).\nThen he would do wudu’ as for prayer; he would start by washing his hands three times, before putting them into the vessel.\nAl-Bukhari (265) and Muslim (317) narrated that Ibn ‘Abbas said: My maternal aunt Maymoonah told me: I brought the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) water to do ghusl from janabah. He washed his hands two or three times, then he put his hand in the vessel and poured some water over his private part and washed it with his left hand. Then he struck his left hand on the ground and rubbed it vigorously. Then he did wudu’ as for prayer, then he poured three handfuls of water over his head, then he washed the rest of his body. Then he moved away from the spot where he had been standing and washed his feet.\nAccording to a report narrated by Muslim: He washed his hands two or three times, then he put his hand in the vessel.\nSee also the answers to questions no. 2532 and 127362 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/219157/how-the-prophet-blessings-and-peace-of-allah-be-upon-him-cleaned-himself-with-water-istinja-after-relieving-himself
232245,"If someone treated his parents badly, then realised his mistake after they died, what should he do so that he might be forgiven?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nDisobedience towards parents is a major sin.\nIt was narrated from ‘Abd ar-Rahman ibn Abi Bakrah that his father (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) said: “Shall I not tell you of the greatest of major sins?” We said: Yes indeed, O Messenger of Allah. He said: “Associating others with Allah (shirk) and disobedience towards parents.” He was reclining, but then he sat up and said, “And – indeed – false speech and false testimony, and – indeed – false speech and false testimony,” and he kept on saying it until I thought he would never stop.\xa0\n(Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5631; Muslim, 87).\xa0\nIt was narrated from ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr, that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The major sins are: associating others with Allah, mistreatment of parents, murder and al-yamin al-ghamus\xa0[an oath which will cause a person to be dipped in the hellfire, that is, a false oath that is sworn knowingly]. Narrated by al-Bukhari (6675).\nMistreatment of parents refers to that which the son does or says – without any shar‘i justification –that causes hurt to his parents.\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: What is meant by mistreatment of parents is any word or deed\xa0 on the part of the son which causes hurt to the father, except in the case where he instructs him to associate something with Allah or commit sin.""(Fath al-Bari\xa0 10/406).\nSecondly:\nOne of the important issues of Islamic belief (‘aqidah) that the Muslim should understand, believe in, and act in accordance with is that it is possible to repent from any sin, no matter how great.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Say, “O My servants who have transgressed against themselves [by sinning], do not despair of the mercy of Allah . Indeed, Allah forgives all sins. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful.”}\xa0[az-Zumar 39:53].\nSo all this person who mistreated his parents has to do now is hasten to repent, for Allah, may He be exalted, has promised to accept the repentance of the one who repents. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And it is He who accepts repentance from His servants and pardons misdeeds, and He knows what you do}\xa0[ash-Shura 42:25].\nIn order for his repentance to be sincere and accepted, it is essential to fulfil the conditions thereof.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe scholars said: Repentance from every sin is essential. If it is something between a person and Allah, may He be exalted, and has nothing to do with the rights of another person, there are three conditions of repentance:\xa0\n\nHe should give up the sin\nHe should regret having done it\nHe should resolve never to go back to it.\n\nIf one of these three is missing, then his repentance is not sincere.""(Riyadh as-Salihin\xa0 p. 14).\nBut one may raise the issue that some of these conditions cannot be fulfilled after the death of the parents.\nThe response to that is twofold:\nThe first point is that in such a case, regret alone is repentance.\nIt was narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn Ma‘qil ibn Muqarrin said: I went with my father to visit ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud, and I heard him say: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Regret is repentance.” Narrated by Ibn Majah (4252) and Ahmad (6/37); classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Sunan Ibn Majah.\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nOne of the rulings on repentance is that if the sinner no longer has the means of committing the sin and it is now beyond him, meaning that it is impossible for him to do it, is repentance valid? Examples of that include the liar, the slanderer and the one who gives false testimony, if their tongues are cut out… And the one who reaches a state where he no longer has any motive to commit a sin that he used to commit.\nConcerning that there are two scholarly views…\nThe second view – which is the correct view – is that it is possible for him to repent sincerely, because the only elements of repentance that is possible in his case is regret. In al-Musnad it is narrated with a marfu‘ isnad that “Regret is repentance.” So if he truly regrets the sin, and blames himself for it, then this is repentance. How can it be truly said that he cannot repent, when he greatly regrets the sin and blames himself for it?\nMadarij as-Salikin (1/741-746).\nThis is the view of the majority of scholars. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe repentance of one who is unable to act - such as the repentance of the one whose penis has been cut off from zina, and the repentance of the one whose hand has been cut off and he is no longer able to steal, and others who are similarly incapacitated and can no longer commit the sin in question – is valid and acceptable according to the majority of scholars among Ahl as-Sunnah and others.""(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa\xa010/746).\nThe second point is that by Allah’s mercy towards the Muslims, He has ordained that the door of reward for honouring parents is not closed when they die, so the son who had fallen short can strive to do whatever he is able to do of honouring them.\nThe ways of honouring parents after their death include the following:\n1. Offering a great deal of supplication (du ‘a’) for them.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{ and say, “My Lord, have mercy upon them as they brought me up [when I was] small”}\xa0[al-Isra’ 17:24].\nIt was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When a man dies, all his good deeds come to an end except three: ongoing charity (sadaqah jaariyah), beneficial knowledge, or a righteous son who will pray for him.” Narrated by Muslim (1631).\nThis supplication is one of the greatest ways of showing kindness to parents.\nIt was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “A man will be raised in status in Paradise and will say, ‘Where did this come from?’ And it will be said: ‘From your son’s praying for forgiveness for you.’”\nNarrated by Ibn Majah (3660); classed as hasan by al-Albani in as-Silsilah as-Sahihah (4/129).\n2. Doing righteous deeds so that the reward thereof will reach them\nsuch as giving charity on their behalf. Please see the answer to question no. 218872 .\nOr doing Hajj and ‘umrah on their behalf. For more information on the guidelines and rulings on doing Hajj on behalf of someone else, please see the answer to question no. 111794 .\nIf they had left behind any debts or things that had been entrusted to them, then the son should strive hard to pay them off on their behalf. Or if they had wronged any people, he should ask those who were wronged to pardon them and he should seek to settle the matter with them.\n3. Honouring their friends and loved ones.\nIt was narrated from ‘Abdullah ibn Dinar, from Ibn ‘Umar, that when Ibn ‘Umar set out for Makkah, he had a donkey with him that he would ride for a change when he tired of riding his camel, and he had a turban that he wrapped around his head. One day whilst he was riding that donkey, a Bedouin passed by him and he said: Aren’t you So and so the son of So and so? He said: Yes. He gave him the donkey and said: Ride this, and he gave him the turban and said: Wrap this around your head. Some of his companions said to him: May Allah forgive you, you have given this Bedouin a donkey that you were riding for a change and a turban that you had wrapped around your head. He said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “One of the best acts of righteousness is for a man to uphold ties with the friends of his father after he (the father) dies.” And his father was a friend of ‘Umar’s.\nNarrated by Muslim (2552).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/232245/he-mistreated-his-parents-and-regretted-it-after-they-died-what-should-he-do
