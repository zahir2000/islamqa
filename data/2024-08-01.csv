What is best, to recite to myself or to play a recording of one of the reciters?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nOne of the ways in which a person may be blessed is when Allah enables him to do righteous deeds, and one of the best of righteous deeds is for a person to invest in his children. “When a person dies, his good deeds come to an end except three: ongoing charity, beneficial knowledge and a righteous child who offers supplication for him.” Narrated by at-Tirmidhi (1376).\nBringing up children to memorize the Quran is one of the noblest acts of worship and one of the best of good deeds.\nYour keenness to do this from this early age is a good sign that is indicative of righteousness and blessing, in sha Allah. Raising children, disciplining them in accordance with Islamic principles, and teaching them that which will benefit them in their religious and worldly affairs form a trust (amanah) that is borne by parents.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{O you who believe, guard yourselves and your families against a fire whose fuel is men and stones, over which are [appointed] angels harsh and stern, who do not disobey Allah in whatever He commands them, and they do whatever they are commanded to do}\n[at-Tahrim 66:6].\n‘Ali ibn Abi Talib (may Allah be pleased with him) said: [That is:] discipline them and teach them.\nIbn ‘Abbas said: [That is:] teach them to obey Allah and to avoid disobeying Allah, and instruct your families to remember Allah, and Allah will save them from the fire.\nMujahid said: [That is:] be mindful of Allah and advise your families to be mindful of Allah.\nQatadah said: He should instruct them to obey Allah and forbid them to disobey Allah, and he should take care of them as Allah has commanded, instruct them to follow His commands and help them to do that. So if you see any act of disobedience towards Allah, then stop them from doing that and rebuke them. See: Tafsir Ibn Kathir (8/167).\nSee also the answers to questions no. 162787 and 10016 .\nSecondly:\nYou should obey Allah so that the child will grow up righteous from the beginning. So let his food, drink and clothing be halal, for in that case blessing (barakah) will come down.\nThirdly:\nYou should make the child get used to hearing the Quran from an early age, so that from the beginning he will be aware of hearing its sound around him and recognize it as Quran. So you can play a recording of the Quran recited by one of the proficient reciters, such as Shaykh al-Husari, throughout the day, near the child.\nYou can also recite the Quran near him, so that the child can hear it.\nFourthly:\nWhen the child reaches an age where he is able to memorize, you should bring him to a proficient teacher who can teach him to memorize the Quran by hearing it, until he reaches an age when he will be able to learn how to recite properly.\nFifthly:\nAfter that, you can use various means to encourage him, such as organizing a family party with the aim of honouring the child when he memorizes a juz’ of the Holy Quran.\nFor more information, please see the answers to questions no. 10016 and 101752 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/320722/how-can-i-make-my-little-son-love-the-quran
150633,"Will a person (a believer) be rewarded if he listens to the Quran without understanding what he is listening to, but he knows that it is Quran? Or will he not be rewarded unless he understands what he is hearing? I hope you could give some evidence from the Quran and authentic Hadiths.","['Praise be to Allah.The command to listen to the Quran attentively\xa0\nAllah, may He be exalted, has commanded the believers to listen to the Quran attentively , in a general command. He says (interpretation of the meaning): “So, when the Quran is recited, listen to it, and be silent that you may receive mercy.” [Al-A`raf 7:204]\xa0\nShaykh As-Sa`di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“This command is general and includes everyone who hears the Book of Allah being recited. He is enjoined to listen to it and keep quiet. The difference between listening and keeping quiet is that keeping quiet is done outwardly by not speaking or being distracted with anything that would keep one from focusing on listening to it.\xa0\nAs for listening to it, this means that one hears it with an attentive heart, pondering the meaning of what one is listening to. The one who adheres to these two commands when the Book of Allah is recited will attain a great deal of good, beneficial knowledge, ongoing and renewed faith, increased guidance and insight into his religion. Hence Allah connected the attainment of mercy to them, which indicates that the one who does not keep quiet and listen attentively when the Book is recited to him will be deprived of the share of mercy and has missed out on a great deal of good.\xa0\nThe most emphatic command with regard to listening to the Quran attentively has to do with prayers in which Quran is recited out loud by the imam , in which one is enjoined to listen attentively, to such an extent that most of the scholars say that his focusing on keeping quiet and listening attentively takes priority over his reciting Al-Fatihah etc.” (Tafsir As-Sa`di, 314)\xa0\nThe greater aim of keeping quiet and listening attentively is so that the listener may ponder and understand the meanings, and act upon them.\xa0\nImam At-Tabari (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Allah says to those who believe in Him and in His Book, for whom the Quran is guidance and mercy: “So, when the Quran is recited”, to you, O believers; “listen to it”, i.e. lend your ears so that you might understand its verses and learn from its exhortation; “and be silent” and listen to it attentively, so that you might understand and ponder, and do not utter idle talk during it lest you do not understand; “that you may receive mercy” i.e., that you might receive the mercy of your Lord by heeding His exhortation and adhering to His limits and to what He enjoins upon you in the verses.” (Tafsir At-Tabari, 13/244)\xa0\nIf a person manages to achieve that, i.e., keeping quiet, listening attentively, pondering what is recited to him and understanding its meanings, that will bring him goodness in this world and the Hereafter.\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“By means of this listening, Allah guides His slaves and sets straight their affairs in this world and the Hereafter; with this the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was sent, and he enjoined it upon the Muhajirin and Ansar and those who followed them in truth. The early generations used to gather for this purpose. When the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) gathered together, they would tell one of their number to recite whilst they listened. `Umar ibn Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) would say to Abu Musa: Remind us of our Lord, and Abu Musa would recite the Quran whilst they listened.” (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 11/626)\xa0\nDo you get reward for listening to Quran without understanding it?\nAs listening in the complete sense is that in which one understands and ponders, there is no doubt that the one who does that as much as he is able is to be commended for what he does, and he is excused for what he is incapable of. But what one is incapable of should not be an excuse for not doing what one is able to do of goodness. What is possible is not to be omitted because of what is difficult; in other words, whatever a person is able to do of obligatory or recommended actions is not waived because of what he is incapable of doing, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “So keep your duty to Allah and fear Him as much as you can”\xa0[At-Taghabun 64:16] \xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\xa0\nWill a person be rewarded if he reads the Quran, even if he does not understand its meanings?\xa0\nHe replied:\xa0\n“The Glorious Quran is blessed, as Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “(This is) a Book (the Quran) which We have sent down to you, full of blessings, that they may ponder over its Verses, and that men of understanding may remember.” [Sad 38:29]\xa0\nSo man is enjoined to read it, whether he understands its meanings or not. But the believer who is enjoined to act upon it should not read the Quran without understanding its meanings. If a person wants to learn medicine, for example, and studies the books of medicine, he cannot benefit from them unless he understands their meanings and they are explained to him; in fact he will be very keen to understand the meanings so that he can apply them. So why do you think anyone should read the Book of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, which is a healing for what is in the hearts and exhortation to people, without pondering and without understanding its meanings? For this reason the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) would not move on from ten verses until they had learned them and learned the knowledge they contained and how to act upon it. So they learned the Quran and knowledge and action all together.\xa0\nA person will be rewarded for reading the Quran whether he understands its meanings or not, but he should be very keen to understand its meanings and to learn these meanings from scholars who are trustworthy in their knowledge. If he has no access to a scholar who can teach him the meanings, he may refer to the trustworthy books of Tafsir, such as Tafsir Ibn Jarir, Tafsir Ibn Kathir and others which pay attention to the Tafsir that is based on reports narrated from the Companions and the Successors (may Allah be pleased with them).” (Fatawa Nur `ala Ad-Darb)\xa0\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 106961 , 50010 , 124657 , 78370 , 174743 , 10672 , and 147164 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/150633/do-you-get-reward-for-listening-to-the-quran-without-understanding-it

Why does nothing happen to the universe when Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, descends in a manner that is befitting to His majesty every night?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nWe ask Allah to help us, you and all the Muslims to raise children in a manner that Allah loves and is pleased with, and to enable us to follow the path of the people of faith and righteousness, and to make all our offspring righteous.\nSecondly:\nThe attributes of Allah do not resemble the attributes of created beings.\nYou must explain to your daughter that there is nothing like unto Allah, may He be glorified, and nothing resembles Him. There is nothing like unto Him and He is the All-Hearing, All-Seeing. You should tell her that the believer believes in the attributes of Allah, may He be glorified, but they cannot be likened to the attributes of created beings.\nYou should tell her that Allah, may He be exalted, is able to do things that humans are not able to do. Allah, may He be exalted, hears everything and sees everything, and He does whatever He wills, because He is the Almighty Creator.\nAs Allah, may He be exalted, has told us about His descending, the believer must believe that He descends, but this descending is not like the descending of people; rather His descending happens in a manner that we do not know, and humans cannot grasp it.\nThirdly:\nThe difference between manifesting and descending\nYou should explain to her that there is a difference between manifesting and descending.\nManifesting means appearing; what is meant is appearing to people’s eyes.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{… he said: O my Lord, show Yourself to me, so that I may look upon You.

That is because, when the concealment was lifted and the mountain saw the divine light, it crumbled. Some of the scholars said that what is meant is that He caused it to break up into small pieces.\nMujahid said regarding the phrase {But look at the mountain; if it remains firm in its place, then you will see Me}: [What is meant is:] it is bigger than you and is a stronger creation. But when his Lord manifested Himself to the mountain, Musa look at the mountain and saw that it was not able to withstand that, and it collapsed completely and broke into small pieces, so he fell down unconscious.\n‘Ikrimah said: {He caused it to crumble} means: Allah looked at the mountain, and it was flattened and turned to dust.\nEnd quote from Tafsir Ibn Kathir (3/47).

This descending happens in a manner that is befitting to His majesty, and we cannot discuss how it is or try to depict it. It is not like the descending of created beings when they move from one place to another, so that there is something above them. Rather He descends to the lowest heaven when He is still above His Throne and above all of His creation, so there is nothing above Him.\nThis is different from the descending of created beings, so no one can imagine it or try to see it in his mind’s eye, for Allah Essence cannot be imagined or comprehended, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): {but they do not encompass Him with their knowledge} [Ta-Ha 20:110].\nSee also the answers to questions no. 12290 and 20081 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/353034/manifestation-and-descent-are-divine-attributes
129666,"If I lose my Wudu during the prayer, should I complete the prayer? Should I complete it from where I left off or start the prayer from the beginning all over again? When should one say the Taslim - is it after the imam’s first Taslim or his second?","['Praise be to Allah.What to do if wudu breaks during prayer\nThe one who loses his Wudu during the prayer, by passing wind or otherwise , should go and do Wudu, then come back and start the prayer from the beginning all over again, according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions. This is the view of the Malikis, Shafa`is and Hanbalis, unlike the Hanafis and the older view of the Shafa`is.\xa0\nThis applies to the one who cannot help breaking his Wudu. As for the one who breaks his Wudu deliberately, his prayer becomes invalid according to scholarly consensus.\xa0\nThe evidence quoted by the majority concerning this issue is analogy. They say, Because breaking wind and the like makes Wudu invalid, so it also makes the prayer invalid, as is also the case when one breaks Wudu deliberately.\xa0\nThe Hanafis quoted as evidence the Hadith of `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever regurgitates, has a nosebleed, vomits, or emits Madhi (prostatic fluid) should stop praying, do Wudu, then resume his prayer, and whilst he is in that situation he should not speak”, but this is an inauthentic Hadith. It was narrated by Ibn Majah, 1221. Al-Busayri said in Az-Zawa’id: Its chain of narrators includes Isma`il ibn `Ayyash, who narrated from the Hijazis, but his narration from them is inauthentic.\xa0\nAl-Hafidh ibn Hajar said in At-Talkhis Al-Habir, 1/495: “More than one of the scholars criticized the report of Isma`il ibn `Ayyash from Ibn Jurayj and the report of Isma`il from the Hijazis as inauthentic. The scholars of Hadith among the companions of Ibn Jurayj differed with Ibn Hajar and they narrated it from Ibn Jurayj, from his father, from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in a Mursal report.” (See: At-Tahqiq fi Ahadith Al-Khilaf by Ibn Al-Jawzi, 1/83; Tanqih At-Tahqiq by Ibn `Abd Al-Hadi, 1/284)\xa0\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “We have stated that our view is the correct, new one, that it is not permissible to resume (from where one left off); rather one has to start all over again. This is the view of the Companions Al-Miswar ibn Makhramah (may Allah be pleased with him). It was also the view of Malik and others. This is the correct view from the Madhhab of Ahmad.\xa0\nAbu Hanifah, Ibn Abu Layla and Al-Awza`i said: “He may continue his prayer from where he left off. This was narrated by Ibn As-Sabbagh and others from `Umar ibn Al-Khattab, `Ali and Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with them). It was also narrated by Al-Bayhaqi from `Ali, Salman Al-Farisi, Ibn `Abbas, Ibn `Umar, Ibn Al-Musayyab, Abu Salamah ibn `Abd Ar-Rahman, `Ata’, Tawus, Abu Idrees Al-Khawlani, Sulayman ibn Yasar and others (may Allah be pleased with them). The author mentioned in brief the evidence for both views, but the Hadith is inauthentic. The Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) differed concerning this issue, so the matter may be resolved on the basis of analogy. And Allah knows best.” (Al-Majmu`, 4/6) (See also Al-Mughni, 1/421)\nAsh-Shafa`i (may Allah have mercy on him) interpreted the reports about some of the Companions\xa0 exiting the prayer because of nosebleed, then going to do Wudu, then resuming the prayer from where they left off as referring to washing away the blood, not Wudu in the sense of ablution for prayer.\xa0\nAnd he (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Rather what is meant by Wudu here, in our opinion, is washing off blood and whatever else had gotten onto the body, not Wudu for prayer. It was narrated from Ibn Mas`ud that he washed his hands after eating, then he wiped his face with his wet hands and said: This is the Wudu of one who has not broken his Wudu. This (usage of the word Wudu) is well known among the Arabs, who use the word to refer to washing some part of the body, not all the parts that should be washed in the case of Wudu for prayer.” (As-Sunan Al-Kubra, 1/143)\xa0\nFurther evidence in support of the majority view is the report narrated by Abu Dawud (205) from `Ali ibn Talq (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If one of you breaks wind whilst praying, let him leave and do Wudu, then repeat the prayer.”\nThere is a difference of opinion as to the soundness of this Hadith. It was classed as authentic by Ibn Hibban and as sound by others.\xa0\nIn Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah there is a question about the Hadith, “Whoever breaks wind during the prayer, let him exit the prayer. If that is during a congregational prayer, let him hold his nose and leave, and do Wudu, then let him resume his prayer from where he left off, so long as he does not speak.”\xa0\nThey replied: “This Hadith was classed as inauthentic by some of the leading scholars of Hadith. Hence what it indicates about the one who breaks his Wudu during the prayer exiting the prayer, then doing Wudu and coming back to complete what is left of his prayer, is not correct. Rather breaking Wudu during the prayer renders it invalid, and after doing Wudu the individual has to start the prayer all over again from the beginning, as is indicated by the Hadith of `Ali ibn Talq (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If one of you breaks wind whilst praying, let him leave and do Wudu, then repeat the prayer.” Narrated by Ahmad, Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa’i and Ibn Majah; classed as authentic by Ibn Hibban.” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 5/438, vol. 2)\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “If a person loses his Wudu whilst praying, by breaking wind or having a severe nosebleed and so on, then his prayer is rendered invalid, according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If one of you breaks wind whilst praying, let him leave and do Wudu, then repeat the prayer.” (Narrated by Imam Ahmad and the authors of As-Sunan. This was also mentioned by Al-Hafidh Ibn Hajar in Al-Bulugh)\nWith regard to the Hadith which mentions resuming the prayer from where one left off, this is a weak Hadith, as was also explained by Al-Hafidh Ibn Hajar in Al-Bulugh.” (Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 10/159)\xa0\nWhen to say Taslim in prayer behind the Imam\xa0\nIt is preferable for the one who is praying behind an imam not to say the Taslim after the prayer until the imam has finished the second Taslim .\xa0\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 154587 , 145246 , 42 , and 20958 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/129666/what-to-do-if-wudu-breaks-during-prayer
