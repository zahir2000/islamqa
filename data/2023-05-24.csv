196037,"I am confused about the issue of purity (taharah) and how a person can remain in a state of purity. I read on your website that impurity (najasah) can be transferred through things that are wet, but not through things or surfaces that are damp. What about other semi-liquids such as honey or creams – can impurity be transferred through them? I take care of a sick person who is not able to walk, and as part of my duties towards him, I clean him after he defecates. What is the ruling in this case? Can the impurity be transferred from a wet surface to something else? Does that also apply to impure substances of all types, whether they are visible or not visible? Can impurity be transferred to a sweaty hand? What if I step into impure water (sewer water, for example), then bring my feet out and leave them without washing until they dry, then put on socks, then my feet and the socks get wet because of sweating – do the socks become impure (najis)? I am confused about all these details, and I hope that you can explain.","['Praise be to Allah.I.\xa0We have never previously on our website differentiated between wet things and damp things with regard to the ruling on impurity. Rather what is wet and what is damp come under the same ruling in that regard. Rather the difference is between things that are wet or damp because of coming into contact with an impure substance (najasah) and dry things. An impurity that is dry cannot be transferred if it comes into contact with another dry surface. This is something that is quite clear, because the dry thing does not develop any of the characteristics of the impure substance (colour, taste or smell) by merely coming into contact with something else that is dry like it.\nAs-Suyuti (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Principle: al-Qamuli said in al-Jawahir: If something impure comes into contact with something pure and they are both dry, that does not make it impure.""(Al-Ashbah wa’n-Naza’ir\xa0 1/432).\nShaykh Ibn Jibrin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Contact of an impure substance that is dry with a body or clothes that are dry does not affect anything, because impurity can only be transferred when it is wet.""(Fatawa Islamiyyah\xa0 1/194).\nBut if it is wet, then it is most likely that it could be transferred, whether it comes into contact with something that is wet or that is dry.\nII.\xa0Honey, cream and other semi-liquids are affected by impure substances if they come into contact and mix with them, therefore they become impure and the impurity may also be transferred to other things through them, especially if the amount into which the impurity fell is small, which would lead to the impure substance spreading through it, and it is not so large an amount that the impact of the impure substance is limited only to the part of the semi-liquid that surrounds it.\nIt was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbas, from Maymunah, that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was asked about a mouse that fell into some ghee. He narrated from Maymunah that a mouse fell into some ghee and died. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was asked about that and he said: “Throw it out, along with what surrounds it, and eat [the rest].” Narrated by al-Bukhari (5538).\nThe Prophet’s words “along with what surrounds it” indicate that what surrounds the impure dead animal has been affected by its impurity. There is no scholarly difference of opinion concerning that; rather the difference of opinion has to do with the semi-liquid other than that.\nWhatever the case, what matters here is that semi-liquids are affected by impure substances, just as water is affected, and more so, because water can ward off impure substances to a greater degree than semi-liquids can.\nIII.\xa0There is no differentiation between visible and non-visible impurity, such as the impurity of urine, for example, so long as it is known that it has reached the place, or any of its characteristics appear in that place. The place becomes impure when one of the three effects of impurity appear in it, namely its colour, its taste or its smell. If we assume that urine fell onto a garment, and the colour of the garment is such that no trace of that urine can be seen, this does not mean that the garment did not become impure.\nBut if the impurity is a small amount, such that it cannot be seen by the naked eye, such as small droplets of urine and the like, then some of the scholars say that it is overlooked.\nAsh-Shirazi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If the impurity is something that cannot be seen, then there are three views concerning it. Some of our companions said that there is no ruling on it, because it cannot be avoided, so it is like dust from manure. Some of them say that it comes under the same ruling as all other impurities, because it is definitely impure, so it is like impurity that can be seen…\xa0End quote.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The correct view out of all of these is that neither water nor garments become impure [as a result of droplets falling on them]. Al-Muhamili stated definitively that this is the correct view in al-Muqni‘, and he quoted it in his two books from Abu’t-Tayyib ibn Salamah. It was also regarded as correct by al-Ghazali and the author of al-‘Uddah, and others, because it is not possible to avoid it and because it may cause hardship if you try to avoid it. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {and [Allah] has not placed upon you in the religion any difficulty } [al-Hajj 22:78]. And Allah knows best.""(Sharh al-Muhadhdhab\xa0 1/178).\nAl-Mirdawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: With regard to what may be overlooked of impurities, that includes what it says in ar-Ri‘aayah: A small amount of impure water may be overlooked if it is like the amount that may be overlooked of blood and the like, according to the more correct opinion. He favoured the view that the small amount that cannot be seen may be overlooked… Shaykh Taqiy ad-Din favoured the view that a small amount of all types of impurity may be overlooked, in food and other things, even mouse faeces. He said in al-Furu‘: That means that he chose the view of the author of an-Nazm. I say: He said in Majma‘ al-Bahrayn: I say: It is more appropriate that that small amount may be overlooked in clothing and food, because it is too difficult to avoid it, and no man of reason will doubt that this is a widespread problem, especially in mills, sugar processing facilities and olive presses. It is more difficult to guard against than water from which mice have drunk, and the blood and vomit of flies. Many of our companions adopted the view that it is pure.""(Al-Insaf\xa0\xa01/334).\nAnd it was said: a small amount of impurity is not to be overlooked, even if it is not visible. See: Kashshaf al-Qina‘ (1/190).\nPlease see also the answer to question no. 169846 .\nV.\xa0If an impure substance gets onto a person, the Sunnah is to hasten to remove it, and not leave it until it dries, because of the hadith of Anas ibn Malik, who said: A Bedouin came and urinated in the mosque, and the people rebuked him, but the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) told them not to do that. When he had finished urinating, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed that a bucket of water should be thrown over it. Narrated by al-Bukhari (221).\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This indicates that one should hasten to remove bad things when there is no reason to delay doing so, because he instructed them to pour water over it as soon as he had finished.""(Fath al-Bari).\nVI.\xa0If the feet on which there is impurity become sweaty, the impurity will inevitably be transferred to the socks, because wet impurity – as noted above – is transferred to other things, even if the place to which it is transferred is dry.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/196037/he-has-several-questions-about-the-transfer-of-impurity-najasah-from-things-that-are-dry-or-wet
317771,"I would like to ask about Ibn ‘Uthaymin’s final opinion regarding the yellowish and brownish discharge, as he said that they are not part of menses at all. My question is: what did he (may Allah have mercy on him) say about the hadith which speaks of the women sending vessels containing pieces of cloth on which there was yellowish discharge to ‘A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), and her telling them not to be hasty until they saw the white discharge? Does this mean that she (may Allah be pleased with her) thought that it was part of menses? Did he (may Allah have mercy on him) think that this hadith was da‘if (weak), because he did not regard the yellowish and brownish discharge as menses, or did he have other reasons? Is the addition of the words “after the end of menses” in the hadith “we did not regard the yellowish and brownish discharge as being of any significance” a da‘if (weak) addition, indicating that the hadith is general in meaning, in which case we should not regard the yellowish and brownish discharge as being part of menses? Please note that I follow the view of those who regard it as menses if it is connected to menses, but I want to put my mind at rest. Are the scholars unanimously agreed that the end of menses can only be confirmed if there is complete dryness?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nthe view that Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) settled on in this regard is that the yellowish and brownish discharge are not part of menses, even if they immediately precede or follow the bleeding, as was explained previously in the answer to question no. 179069 .\nWith regard to what happens of such discharges during menses and before the end of bleeding, that is regarded as menses, because it is connected to menses.\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked in al-Liqa’ ash-Shahri (73/37): Dear Shaykh, I hope that you can explain this matter, as there is a great deal of talk about it, namely the ruling on the brownish and yellowish discharge that comes out of a woman after the menstrual bleeding stops. When does the woman’s menses end, and is it essential to see the white discharge?\nHe replied: This is a matter concerning which the scholars differed. My final view concerning this issue is that no attention is to be paid to the brownish or yellowish discharge, unless it occurs during the menses. In other words, for example, a woman whose menses usually lasts for five days sees a brownish or yellowish discharge on the third day. In this case, we say that it is part of menses.\nHowever, in the case of a woman who sees a brownish or yellowish discharge before the bleeding begins, no attention is to be paid to this brownish and yellowish discharge.\nAnother woman’s menses ends, and the bleeding ceases, but the yellowish and brownish discharge continues. No attention is to be paid to that. End quote.\nThe view that the yellowish and brownish discharge are not part of menses is the view of Ibn Hazm (may Allah have mercy on him), in contrast to the majority of scholars of the four madhhabs and others regarding that.\nSee: al-Muhalla (266, 267); Mawsu‘at at-Taharah by ad-Dubyaan (6/286).\nSecondly:\nWe have not come across any suggestion that the shaykh (may Allah have mercy on him) regarded as da‘if the phrase “after the end of menses.” Rather he quoted it as evidence in several places, and stated clearly that it was sahih (sound), and it is indeed sahih.\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Whatever comes after the end of menses of brownish or yellowish discharge, or spotting, or moisture, all of that is not menses, so it does not prevent the woman from praying or fasting, and it does not prevent the man from having intercourse with his wife, because it is not menses. Umm ‘Atiyyah said: “We used to regard the yellowish and brownish discharge as being of no significance.” Narrated by al-Bukhari. Abu Dawud added the phrase “after the end of menses,” and its isnad is sahih. End quote from Majmu‘ al-Fatawa (11/281).\nAnd he (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The words of Umm ‘Atiyyah (may Allah be pleased with her): “We used to regard the yellowish and brownish discharge after the end of menses as being of no significance” were narrated by Abu Dawud with a sahih isnad. It was also narrated by al-Bukhari without the phrase “after the end of menses,” but he included it under the heading: Yellowish and brownish discharge at times other than the days of menses.\nIt says in the commentary Fath al-Bari: He refers thereby to reconciling between the hadith of ‘A’ishah quoted above, in which she said “until you see the white discharge” and the hadith of ‘Umm ‘Atiyyah concerning this topic, by understanding the hadith of ‘A’ishah as referring to if she sees the yellowish and brownish discharge during the days of her menses, whereas if that occurs at any other time, then it is to be interpreted according to what Umm ‘Atiyyah said. End quote.\nThe hadith of ‘A’ishah referred to here is that which al-Bukhari narrated as a mu‘allaq majzum report before this chapter, according to which the women used to send [menstrual cloths] to her in vessels. (11/306).\nAfter adopting his final view, the shaykh (may Allah have mercy on him) interpreted the words of Umm ‘Atiyyah “after the end of menses” as referring to the cessation of bleeding. Before that, he thought that what was meant by the end of menses was the white discharge or complete dryness.\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) said: When the bleeding of menses ceases and is followed by yellowish or brownish discharge, that does not mean anything. In other words, the brownish or yellowish discharge after the cessation of bleeding does not mean anything, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And they ask you about menstruation. Say, “It is harm…”}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:222],\nand what is meant by harm is bleeding.\nUmm ‘Atiyyah said: “We used to regard the yellowish and brownish discharge as being of no significance.” This is how it was narrated by al-Bukhari.\nThe report narrated by Abu Dawud says: “after the end of menses”. But the end of menses is when the bleeding ceases.\nBased on that, we say to this woman: So long as she sees menses – that is, bleeding – for seven days, then that is followed by brownish or yellowish discharge, she should do ghusl after the bleeding of menses stops – that is, after the completion of seven days – then start to pray and fast, and her husband may have intercourse with her if she has a husband, even if she has yellowish or brownish discharge.""(Al-Liqa’ ash-Shahri\xa0 36/22).\nThe shaykh also argued that menses is the bleeding, not the yellowish and brownish discharge. Al-Liqa’ ash-Shari (51/8).\nWith regard to the report of ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), he interpreted it as referring to the emission of yellowish discharge before the bleeding ceases, as noted above in the chapter heading given by al-Bukhari to the hadith of Umm ‘Atiyyah.\nWhatever the case, the more correct view regarding this issue is that brownish and yellowish discharge during the days of menses is also menses, and this is what the jurists refer to as being “within the expected timeframe.” Whether it occurs at the beginning of menses and is connected to it, or during menses, or at the end of menses, if the bleeding has stopped and the brownish and yellowish discharge continue, all of that is menses. This is the view of the majority of scholars concerning that, to the extent that it was narrated that there was consensus.\nThirdly:\nThe end of menses may be confirmed by dryness, according to most jurists, except for what was narrated from Malik (may Allah have mercy on him) about the woman who usually sees the white discharge; in her case, the end of menses is not marked by dryness.\nShaykh Abu ‘Umar ad-Dubyan said in Mawsu‘at at-Taharah (7/37):\n4. The sign of the end of menses\nIt was said: When menses ends, the woman definitely becomes pure, whether any white moisture comes out after that or not. This is the view of the Hanafis, Shafa‘is and Hanbalis.\nAnd it was said that if she is one of those who see the white discharge, her menses does not end until she sees it, and if she is one of those who do not see that, then her menses ends when she sees dryness. This is the view stated in al-Mudawwanah from Imam Malik (may Allah have mercy on him).\nAnd it was said that in the case of the woman whose sign of menses ending is usually the white discharge, if she sees dryness, then her menses has ended, but in the case of the woman whose sign of menses ending is usually dryness, her menses does not end if she sees the white discharge, until she sees dryness.\nAnd it was said that there are two signs of the end of menses: dryness and the white discharge. So whichever of the two the woman sees, this is the sign that her menses has ended, regardless of whether the woman usually knows that her menses has ended by seeing the white discharge or dryness. This is the view of Ibn Habib, among the companions of Malik (may Allah have mercy on him).\nAnd it was said: When the woman sees traces of red blood, or something like water after washing meat (i.e., a pinkish discharge), or a yellowish or brownish discharge, or a white discharge, or complete dryness, then her menses has ended. This is the view of Ibn Hazm.\nThus it becomes clear that the different views are as follows:\n\nWhat matters is complete dryness.\nThe white discharge takes precedence over dryness, if she experiences it.\nDryness takes precedence over the white discharge, if she experiences both.\nDryness and the white discharge are both signs of the end of menses.\nIf she sees traces of red blood, or something like water after washing meat (i.e., a pinkish discharge), or a yellowish or brownish discharge, or a white discharge, or complete dryness, then her menses has ended.\n\n…\nThe evidence for those who said that if she sees the white discharge, then dryness does not matter is what ‘Isa ibn Dinar said: The white discharge is more indicative of the end of menses than dryness.\nAl-Hafiz said: The cotton may come out dry during menses, so it does not prove that menses has ended, in contrast to the white discharge. End quote.\nThere is no view contrary to the view that dryness is the sign of the end of menses, except what we have quoted above from Malik.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/317771/is-dryness-the-agreed-upon-sign-of-the-end-of-menses
