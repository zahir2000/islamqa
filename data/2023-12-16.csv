469281,"I want to ask: is it permissible to delay a fast in expiation for breaking an oath (kaffarat yamin) because of extreme heat? I only want to delay it until the heatwave is over, because I owe twelve days.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe expiation for breaking a vow (kaffarat yamin) is mentioned by Allah, may He be exalted, in the verse (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Allah will not impose blame upon you for what is meaningless in your oaths, but He will impose blame upon you for [breaking] what you intended of oaths. So its expiation is the feeding of ten needy people from the average of that which you feed your [own] families or clothing them or the freeing of a slave. But whoever cannot find [or afford it] - then a fast of three days [is required]. That is the expiation for oaths when you have sworn. But guard your oaths. Thus does Allah make clear to you His verses that you may be grateful}\xa0[Al-Ma’idah 5:89].\nSo the one who broke his oath has the choice between three things: either feeding ten poor persons, or clothing them, or freeing a slave.\nIf he is unable to do any of these three, then he moves to the option of fasting, but it is not permissible for him to move to the option of fasting if he is able to feed ten poor persons.\nFor more information on the expiation for breaking an oath (kaffarat yamin), please see the answer to question no. 45676 .\nSecondly:\nIf a Muslim breaks his vow, he must hasten to offer expiation for that immediately, and it is not permissible for him to delay it, so long as he is able to do it immediately.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Fulfilling a vow or offering expiation for breaking it, in our view, is to be done immediately.""(Al-Fatawa al-Kubra\xa05/518).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Similarly, part of guarding oaths is offering expiation after breaking an oath. That expiation is required immediately, because the basic principle is that obligatory duties are to be done immediately, and that means what is required in the case of an oath.""(Al-Qawl al-Mufid ‘ala Kitab al-Tawhid (2/456). See also: al-Sharh al-Mumti‘\xa0 15/159).\nThirdly:\nIf the Muslim is going to offer expiation for breaking his oath by fasting, and the weather is extremely hot, to the point that it makes fasting unusually difficult, then what appears to be the case is that it is permissible for him to delay fasting until the heatwave ends, so that his fast will be bearable. That is because it is permissible to delay doing obligatory duties, if there is a need or valid reason for doing so.\nThat is supported by the fact that the issue of whether expiation is to be offered immediately or that it may be done at any time is one of the issues concerning which differences of scholarly opinion are valid.\nIt says in al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (10/14): The majority of scholars are of the view that it is not permissible to delay offering expiation for breaking an oath, and that it must be offered as soon as the oath is broken, because this is what we should understand when the command is given without specifying a time. The Shafa‘is are of the view that offering expiation for breaking an oath is obligatory, but the timing for it is flexible. End quote.\nAs following the view that it must be done immediately will be extremely difficult for the accountable person, it is permissible for him to follow the view that offering expiation is flexible and may be delayed.\nMoreover, the scholars have stated that it is permissible to delay giving zakah, if there is a valid reason or need to do so, and the obligation to give zakah is more important than the obligation to offer expiation for breaking an oath, because it is one of the pillars of Islam.\nThe scholars have stated that a person may delay giving zakah if he is poor and needs to keep this money, then he may give it when his situation improves, and he may delay it in order to give it to a relative or to one who is in greater need.\nSee: al-Insaf by al-Mawardi (7/141).\nAs it is permissible to delay giving zakah because of need or because there is some purpose to be served by delaying it, the same may be said with regard to the expiation for breaking an oath, because its obligation is less important than the obligation of giving zakah.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/469281/is-it-permissible-to-delay-fasting-in-expiation-for-breaking-a-oath-until-the-heatwave-is-over
230456,"My husband died a short while ago, and I am now in the `Iddah period, adhering to what is required during this time. A few days ago I spoke to the mother of one of my friends, and she said that for them in Turkey, the matter is somewhat different with regard to the woman in `Iddah, and that the only thing she must refrain from is getting married, and nothing else; as for other matters, such as putting on perfume, adorning herself, or going out for necessary purposes, they do not see anything wrong with that. She attributed this to the Hanafi Madhhab that the people in that country follow. Is what she said correct? Is there a difference of opinion among the jurists of the four Madhhabs concerning the `Iddah of a recently-widowed woman? I would like to know these details, not only for myself, but so that I can offer advice to that woman.","['Praise be to Allah.What this woman has told you, and attributed it to the Hanafi Madhhab (school of jurisprudence) – that the recently-widowed woman only has to refrain from remarrying, and that anything other than that, such as adorning herself, is permissible for her and there is no blame on her if she does it – is not correct. The Hanafi jurists have stated that the recently-widowed woman must refrain from adorning herself.\nAs-Samarqandi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Tuhfat Al-Fuqaha’ (2/251): “Explanation of mourning: it means avoiding everything that women adorn themselves with, such as putting on perfume, wearing clothing that has been dyed with safflower or saffron, putting kohl on their eyes, using skin creams, combing their hair, wearing jewellery, dyeing their hair, and so on.”\nIn Tabyin Al-Haqa’iq Sharh Kanz Ad-Daqa’iq (3/34) by Az-Zayla`i (may Allah have mercy on him), it says:\xa0\n“The recently-widowed woman observes mourning by refraining from adornment, perfume, kohl, skin cream (unless she has a legitimate excuse to use it), henna, and clothes dyed with safflower and saffron, if she is an adult and Muslim. That is because of the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “It is not permissible for a woman who believes in Allah and the Last Day to mourn for more than three days for someone who has died, except in the case of a husband, in which case she should observe mourning for him for four months and ten days ; she should not wear kohl, or wear any dyed garment except `Asb (an unattractive Yemeni garment), or use perfume except when she purifies herself [following menses], a little Qust or Azfar [types of perfume].” \xa0(Al-Bukhari and Muslim).\xa0\nHe (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) also said: “The woman whose husband has died should not wear clothes dyed with safflower, or jewellery, or dye her hair, or use kohl.” (Narrated by Ahmad, Abu Dawud and An-Nasa’i)\nThe Hanafi jurists (may Allah have mercy on them) regard it as permissible for the recently-widowed woman to go out during the day if there is a need for her to go out , such as earning a living, seeking medical treatment, and the like, on condition that she go home at night and spend the night at home.\xa0\nIt says in Al-Bahr Ar-Ra’iq Sharh Kanz Ad-Daqa’iq wa Minhat Al-Khaliq (4/166):\xa0\n“The recently-widowed woman may go out during the day and part of the night in order to earn a living… But it is not permissible for her to go out to visit other people or for any other purpose, whether by night or by day.\nTo sum up, the only reason for which she is allowed to go out is if she has a need to in order to attend to her business or errands; once she does what she needs to, it is not permissible for her after that to spend time outside her house.”\xa0\nAl-Kasaani (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “With regard to the recently-widowed woman, she should not go out at night, but there is nothing wrong with her going out during the day to attend to her errands, such as if she needs to go out during the day to earn enough to cover her expenses, because she has no maintenance from her deceased husband; rather she is responsible for her own maintenance, so she needs to go out in order to earn that money. However, she should not go out at night, because there is no need for her to go out at night. This is in contrast to the recently-divorced woman, whose ex-husband is responsible for her maintenance, and thus she has no need to go out."" (Bada’i` As-Sana’i` fi Tartib Ash-Shara’i`, 3/205)\nWith regard to staying in the house and avoiding adornment during the `Iddah period, there is virtual consensus among the four Madhhabs.\nIn the case of the Maalikis, Ibn `Abd al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Kafi fi Fiqh Ahl Al-Madinah (2/622): “Mourning is obligatory for the one whose husband has died, until her `Iddah is complete , either in terms of the requisite number of months or when her pregnancy ends.\nMourning means avoiding everything with which women adorn themselves , such as jewellery, cosmetics, kohl, dyeing the hair, or coloured or white garments worn for the purpose of adornment. ... As for jewellery, rings and so on, it is not permissible for the woman who is in mourning to wear them. The same applies to all kinds of perfume. If she has no choice but to use kohl, she should apply it at night and remove it during the day. She should not use any kind of perfumed oils. As for things that are not used for the purpose of beautification, there is nothing wrong with the woman who is in mourning using them.”\nIn the case of the Shafa`is, Abu Ishaq Ash-Shirazi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in At-Tanbih fil Fiqh Ash-Shafa`i (1/201): “Mourning means avoiding adornment. So she (the woman who is in mourning) should not wear jewellery, put on perfume, dye her hair, style her hair, or use kohl made of antimony. If she needs to use kohl, she should apply it at night and wash it off during the day. She should not wear red or bright blue clothes. She should not go out of her house unnecessarily, and if there is a need for her to go out, it is not permissible to do that at night. It is permissible for the recently-widowed woman to go out to meet her needs during the day.”\nIn the case of the Hanbalis, Ibn Qudamah Al-Maqdisi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in `Umdat Al-Fiqh (1/107): Chapter on Mourning: “It (mourning ) is obligatory for the woman whose husband has died, and it means avoiding adornment, perfume, kohl made of antimony, and the wearing of dyed clothes for the purpose of beautification .… She should stay at night in her house in which she is obliged to observe `Iddah and where she is living, if possible.”\nFor more details, please see this category: Waiting Period of Widow or Divorcee\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/230456/rules-of-iddah-for-widows

223721,"Is the reward multiplied if there are multiple intentions for the same action, such as if a person prays two Sunnah Rak`ahs of Fajr, intending thereby to seek the reward for that and the reward for the Sunnah prayer following Wudu and the reward for “greeting the mosque” (Tahiyyat Al-masjid)?","['Praise be to Allah.Yes, the reward may be multiplied if there are multiple intentions for a single deed. If the Muslim enters the mosque having done Wudu, then prays two rak`ahs intending them as the Sunnah prayer of Fajr , the Sunnah prayer following Wudu and the Sunnah prayer of greeting the mosque , he will attain the reward of what he intended, and Allah is the bestower of great bounty.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“If a person starts to pray, intending it as both the obligatory prayer and the prayer to greet the mosque, his prayer is valid and he will attain the reward of both the obligatory prayer and greeting the mosque."" (Al-Majmu`\xa0 1/325)\nAl-Ghazali (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Ihya’ `Ulum Ad-Din (4/370-371):\n“Acts of obedience and worship are connected to their intentions, as far as their soundness is concerned and as far as their multiple reward is concerned .\nWith regard to soundness, it means that he intends by doing this action to worship Allah, may He be Exalted, and nothing else; if he intends to show off, then his action becomes a sin.\nWith regard to multiple reward , that is connected to the number of good intentions. By doing one act of obedience and worship, it is possible to intend many good things thereby, and he will have a reward for each intention. That is because for each of these intentions he will have a reward, and each reward will be multiplied tenfold, as is mentioned in the Hadith.\xa0\nFor example, sitting in the mosque is an act of worship, and a person may have several intentions when doing that, so that it becomes like one of the good deeds of the pious, and he attains thereby the level of those who are close to Allah.\nWhilst sitting in the mosque, he may do the following:\n\nBelieving that (the mosque) is the House of Allah, and that the one who enters it is visiting his Lord, so he intends thereby to visit his Lord in the hope of what the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) promised when he said: “Whoever sits in the mosque has visited Allah, may He be Exalted, and it is incumbent upon the one who is visited to honour his visitor.”\nWaiting for one prayer after another.\nSpending some time in devotion, by restraining his hearing, sight and physical faculties from moving and wandering, for I`tikaf is restraint and it is akin to fasting, which is a type of devotion.\nFocusing one’s thoughts on Allah and reflecting upon the hereafter, and warding off everything that may distract him from that by staying in the mosque.\nFocusing on remembering Allah, or listening to that which will remind him of Allah.\nIntending to benefit others with his knowledge by enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong, because in the mosque there are bound to be people who pray badly or engage in activities that are not permissible in the mosque.\nGetting to know brothers in faith.\nRefraining from sins out of shyness before Allah, may He be Exalted, and out of shyness lest one do in the house of Allah that which is a transgression against its sanctity.\n\nThis is a way to increase the number of intentions, and you can extend this by analogy to all other acts of worship and permissible actions, because there is no act of obedience and worship that cannot have several intentions. The believer may bring to mind intentions commensurate with his eagerness to do good and his efforts to do that. Thus, his deeds will grow and his rewards for good deeds will multiply .”\xa0\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“A person may do Wudu and pray two Rak`ahs, intending them to be the Sunnah prayer following Wudu, but if he enters the mosque after doing Wudu and prays two Rak`ahs, intending them to be greeting the mosque and the Sunnah prayer following Wudu, he will attain two rewards: the reward of the Sunnah prayer following Wudu and the reward of greeting the mosque. Praise be to Allah, the bounty of Allah is immense. If he prays with the intention of offering the regular Sunnah prayer of Dhuhr, meaning that he does Wudu, enters the mosque, and intends the Sunnah prayer of Dhuhr , the Sunnah prayer following Wudu and the Sunnah prayer of greeting the mosque, he will attain the reward of all of that, praise be to Allah.""
