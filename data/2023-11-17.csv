348292,I've learned that Islam teaches spouses to love one another and be attached to one another after Nikah and stay with each other with tranquility.,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe great selflessness of the Ansar\nAl-Bukhari (3781) narrated from Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn ‘Awf came to us, and the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instituted the bond of brotherhood between him and Sa‘d ibn al-Rabi‘, who was very wealthy. Sa‘d said: The Ansar know that I am one of the wealthiest of them,\xa0so I will divide my wealth equally between me and you. And I have two wives, so see which of them you like better, and I will divorce her so that when she becomes lawful, you may marry her. ‘Abd al-Rahman said: May Allah bless your family for you. [He went to the market to trade] and did not return on that day until he had acquired some gain of ghee and dried yoghurt. [He went on trading] until, within a short time, he came to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) with traces of yellow perfume on him. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to him: “What is this scent?” He said: I have married a woman of the Ansar. He said: “What mahr did you give her?” He said: A date-stone’s weight of gold, or a date-stone of gold. He said: “Give a wedding feast (walimah), even with one sheep.”\nThis is an example of the greatest selflessness, in which a man gives precedence to his brother over himself in that regard. He did not stop at offering to give up one of his wives for him; rather he give him the option of choosing the better one, for he was married to two women, as it was narrated by Ahmad (13863) that Sa‘d said: I have two wives, so see which of them you like best, so that I may divorce her…\nHence Allah praised the Ansar by saying (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And those who were already settled in the land [of Madinah] before them, and were sincere in faith, love the Muhajirun who came to them, and find no covetous desire in their hearts for what they have been given. Rather they give them preference over themselves, even if they too are poor. Those who are protected from their own covetousness – it is they who will be the successful ones}\xa0[al-Hashr 59:9].\nThis selflessness is not something that was found exclusively among the men of the Ansar; rather their women were the same. Undoubtedly Sa‘d ibn al-Rabi‘ (may Allah be pleased with him) knew from the attitude and faith of his wives that they would not object to this selflessness, and would never let him down, and that one of them would leave her husband and marry someone else to fulfil his wish and share with him in the reward and being brought close to Allah.\nSo we should not compare their situation to ours and how stingy we are, for they were far above what we could imagine.\nMoreover, the Arabs did not see anything wrong with that, meaning that a man would divorce his wife, then she would marry someone else. The matter of marriage and divorce was something easy for them.\nSecondly:\nDivorce for no reason and no need is disliked (makruh), and it was said that it is prohibited (haram), but this was a case of great need, which was the need to help the Muhajirin who had been expelled from their land and lost their wealth.\nThirdly:\nA comment on the action of the Sahabi mentioned in this report\nChoosing the wife which he liked best was not something that was limited only to looking at the woman. There are many other factors to be considered when choosing a wife, such as her lineage, her age and whether she has children or not. Moreover, hijab had not yet been enjoined, so it was possible to see her, and it was also possible to find out about her from other women.\nWhat matters is that this did not happen, so there is no need to make assumptions about the way in which the choice was made. Rather what happened is what is recorded in the reports. This is the unique selflessness that Allah instilled in the supporters of His cause and the supporters (Ansar) of His Messenger Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nThere is no need to imagine or assume anything. It is sufficient for us to know that Allah praised these people (the Ansar) and is pleased with them, and that they gave precedence to their brothers over themselves, and their brothers, the Muhajirin, responded by thanking them and refraining from taking them up on such offers.\nWhat the Sahabi suggested did not happen at all, so why do we need to ask this question or to suggest that if that had happened, it would have been something bad or unfair, or to describe it as such and such, when it did not even happen?\nRather we should focus on the point of this story, which is the great selflessness of the companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), their love of good for their brothers, and their being free of stinginess even with regard to that which was most precious to them, namely their wives, so how about other matters?\nMay Allah be pleased with them all, and may He make us among those of whom He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And [there is a share for] those who came after them, saying, “Our Lord, forgive us and our brothers who preceded us in faith and put not in our hearts [any] resentment toward those who have believed. Our Lord, indeed You are Kind and Merciful”}\xa0[al-Hashr 59:10].\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/348292/a-comment-on-confusion-about-the-story-of-sad-ibn-al-rabi-divorcing-his-wife-so-that-abd-al-rahman-ibn-awf-could-marry-her
131777,"What is the duty of a Muslim towards a non-Muslim, whether he is a Dhimmi in a Muslim country or in his own country, and the Muslim is living in the land of that non-Muslim?","['Praise be to Allah.Duties of Muslims towards non-Muslims\nShaykh ‘Abd Al-‘Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“The duty of the Muslim towards a non-Muslim includes a number of things:\xa0\n\nDa`wah or calling him to Allah , may He be Glorified and Exalted. He should explain to him the reality of Islam when possible, with regard to whatever issues the Muslim has knowledge about, because this is the greatest kindness one can give to his fellow-citizens and to those whom he meets of Jews, Christians and others who may be polytheists.\xa0\n\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The one who guides others to goodness will have a reward like that of the one who does it.”\xa0\nHe (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) also said to `Ali (may Allah be pleased with him), when he sent him to Khaybar and instructed him to call the Jews to Islam: “By Allah, if Allah were to guide one man through you, that would be better for you than having red camels (the best kind).” Furthermore, he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever calls others to right guidance will have a reward like that of those who follow him, without that detracting from their reward in the slightest.”\nSo calling the non-Muslim to Islam, conveying Islam to him and being sincere towards him are among the best means of drawing close to Allah.\xa0\n\nThe Muslim should not wrong the non-Muslim, with regard to his physical wellbeing, his wealth or his honour. If he is a Dhimmi (non-Muslim living under Muslim rule), Musta’man (one who is granted security in a Muslim land) or Mu`ahid (one with whose country the Muslims have a peace agreement), then he should give him his due rights, and not transgress against his wealth by stealing, betraying or deceiving, and he should not harm him physically by striking or killing him, because the fact that he is a Mu`ahid or Dhimmi, or Musta’man, means that he is protected by Shari‘ah.\xa0\nThere is no reason why we should not interact with him, buying, selling, renting, hiring and so on. It is narrated in authentic reports that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) bought from the disbelievers who were idol worshippers, and he bought from the Jews, and these are interactions. When he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) died, his shield was being held in pledge by a Jew for some food he had bought for his family (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\xa0\nWith regard to greeting, a Muslim should not initiate the greeting , but he may respond if greeted, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not initiate the greeting of Salam with the Jews or Christians.” And he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If the people of the Book greet you with Salam (by saying Al-salamu ‘alaykum), say ‘Wa ‘alaykum.’” So the Muslim should not initiate the greeting to a disbeliever, but if the disbeliever initiates it, and the Jew or Christians etc. greets you with Salam, then you should say “wa ‘alaykum,” as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said.\xa0\n\nThese are some of the rights between a Muslim and a disbeliever.\xa0\nAnother right is to be a good neighbour. So if he is a neighbour, be kind to him and do not annoy him; give charity to him if he is poor, give him gifts, give him beneficial advice, because these are things that will attract him to Islam and to become Muslim; and because the neighbour has rights.\nThe Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Jibril kept urging me to be kind to my neighbour until I thought that he would make him my heir.” (Al-Bukhari and Muslim)\nIf the neighbour is a disbeliever, he still has the rights of a neighbour; if he is both a relative and a disbeliever, then he has two rights: the right as a neighbour and the right as a relative.\xa0\nOne of the rights of the neighbour is that you should give him charity , but not Zakah, if he is poor, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Allah does not forbid you to deal justly and kindly with those who fought not against you on account of religion nor drove you out of your homes. Verily, Allah loves those who deal with equity.” [Al-Mumtahanah 60:8]\xa0\nAccording to an authentic Hadith narrated from Asma’ bint Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with her), her mother, who was a disbeliever, entered upon her during the truce between the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and the people of Makkah, seeking her help. Asma’ (may Allah be pleased with her) asked the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) for permission - should she uphold ties of kinship with her? The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Uphold ties of kinship with her.”\xa0\nCan Muslims celebrate non-Muslim festivals?\nWith regard to celebrating non-Muslim festivals, the Muslim should not take part in celebrating their festivals , but there is nothing wrong with offering them condolences if a loved one dies, such as saying “May Allah compensate you in your loss” and other kind words. However, he should not say “May Allah forgive him” or “May Allah have mercy on him” if the deceased was a disbeliever, and he should not pray for the deceased if he was a disbeliever. He may pray for the one who is alive to be guided and to be compensated and so on.” (Fatawa Noor ‘ala Ad-Darb, 1/289-291).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/131777/duties-of-muslims-towards-non-muslims
394458,"What is the ruling on celebrating separation by khul‘ from a bad husband, to have some joy after going through a bad time?","['Praise be to Allah.Separation of spouses is something that the Shaytan loves and is keen to make happen.\nMuslim (5023) narrated that Jabir said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Iblis placed his throne on water then he sends out his emissaries, and the closest of them to him in status is the one who causes the most fitnah (trouble). One of them comes and says, ‘I did such and such,’ and he says, ‘You have not done much.’ Then another of them comes and says, ‘I did not leave him alone until I caused division between him and his wife,’ and he draws him close to him and says, ‘How good you are.’”\nAl-Nawawi said in Sharh Sahih Muslim:\nRegarding the words “and he draws him close to him and says, ‘How good you are’”, he praises him because he is impressed with what he did, and he achieved the goal that he wanted. End quote.\nAbu Dawud (2178) narrated that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The most hateful of permissible things to Allah is divorce,” The isnad of this hadith is da‘if (weak), but its meaning is sound, as has been explained previously in the answer to question no. 120761 .\nIf that is the case, then how can a Muslim celebrate the occurrence of something that Allah, may He be exalted, hates and that the Shaytan is pleased with and encourages?\nThat is in addition to what may happen in such a celebration of evils and objectionable matters, such as free mixing between men and women, wanton display of beauty (tabarruj), temptation (fitnah), music and singing.\nMoreover, this celebration is offensive to the husband and closes the door to any possibility of the spouses coming back together, because if the husband finds out that his wife has held a celebration when the khul‘ took place, it is unlikely that he will think of going back to her.\nConclusion: what appears to be the case is that this kind of innovated celebration and unacceptable custom is not allowed. The marriage contract is something sacred, and there are rules and etiquette to be observed when it is to be dissolved. In fact, the husband has rights, even after separation, and it is for this reason that ‘iddah has been prescribed.\nIf the husband is abusive towards the wife, and she cannot find any way to free herself from his abuse except by means of khul‘, and she manages to do that, then it is sufficient for her to say “Al-hamdu Lillah” and praise Allah, may He be exalted, for having saved her from this abuser, without celebrating and showing excessive joy.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/394458/is-it-permissible-to-celebrate-separation-by-khul-or-talaq-from-an-abusive-husband
150579,"I have a little knowledge about Murabahah transactions, and I hope that you can explain it in a way that will help us to avoid anything prohibited.","['Praise be to Allah.How does Murabahah work in Islamic banks?\n\nIn a Murabahah transaction, you typically enter into an agreement with a company or bank to buy specific items, such as a car or building materials, with a promise to the company that when it buys the products and takes possession of them, you will buy products from them with a certain profit margin.\xa0\nThis Murabahah is not a loan , and calling this transaction a loan is wrong, unless the so-called Murabahah transaction is incorrect and the company did not buy the product for itself, rather all it did was finance the customer by giving him the money. In that case it is a loan; in fact it is a Riba-based loan because the company is asking the customer to pay back the loan plus an added amount.\xa0\nWhat are the conditions of a valid Murabahah?\nThe correct form of Murabahah involves the following steps:\xa0\n\n\nOne tells the company about the products that you want to acquire.\n\n\nThe company buys these products for itself.\n\n\nThe company takes possession of the products and moves them from the dealer’s place. It is not permissible for it to sell the products to the customer before taking possession of them and moving them.\n\n\nThe company sells the products to the customer after taking possession of them.\n\n\nOnce the company has sold the products to you, it is permissible for you to use them to build the house, or to sell them in the marketplace in order to obtain cash, so long as you sell them to someone who has no connection to the company or the dealer who sold them to the company. It is also stipulated that you should sell them yourself, and it is not permissible for you to delegate the company to sell them for you.\xa0\n\n\nIf these conditions are met, then the Murabahah is valid.\xa0\nThe evidence that the company is obliged to take possession of the products and move them from the dealer’s place is the report narrated by Ahmad (15399) and An-Nasa’i (4613), according to which Hakeem ibn Hizaam (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I said: O Messenger of Allah, I buy and sell things; what is permissible for me with regard to them and what is forbidden? He said: “When you have bought something, do not sell it until you have taken possession of it.” (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Al-Jami‘, no. 342)\xa0\nAd-Daraqutni and Abu Dawud (3499) narrated from Zayd ibn Thabit (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade selling goods in the same place where they were bought, before the merchants moves them to their places. (Classed as authentic by Ibn Hiban and Al-Hakim; classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud.)\xa0\nIbn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever buys some foodstuff, let him not sell it until he has received it in full.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari (2132) and Muslim (1525), who added: Ibn ‘Abbas said: I think that all things are like this, i.e., there is no difference between foodstuffs and other things in that regard.)\xa0\nConnection between the customer and the dealer\nThere is no connection between you and the dealer who sells the construction material, so you do not have the right to ask him to keep the money until prices drop, because the valid Murabahah transaction – as stated above – is the transaction in which the company must buy from the dealer. When the company has bought the products and taken possession of them, then it is your turn, which means that you buy them from the company. If the price of the materials is too high, then you can wait until prices drop, and then apply for the Murabahah deal.\xa0\nFor more details, please see these answers: 81967 and 13479 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/150579/conditions-of-murabahah
