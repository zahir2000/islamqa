426969,"I got a job a month ago, and I used to use sunblock because of my work situation, and when the time for prayer came, I would do wudu and pray. Then I read that sunblock may prevent water from reaching the skin when doing wudu, and most of the time I was using sunblock. My question is: what must I do now? Do I have to repeat my prayers? Please note that it is very difficult for me to work out the number of prayers I must make up, except the prayers of today only, because I am certain that I put on sunblock today when I did wudu?","['Praise be to Allah.It is obligatory to remove anything that may prevent water from reaching the skin, so that you will be able to wash the parts of the body in wudu as enjoined in the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{O you who have believed, when you rise to [perform] prayer, wash your faces and your forearms to the elbows and wipe over your heads and wash your feet to the ankles}\xa0[al-Ma’idah 5:6].\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him): “If you find water and make it touch your skin, that is good.” Narrated by Abu Dawud (332); classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud.\nWhat prevents water from reaching the skin is that which has a substance and thickness, and does not dissolve in water.\nAs for that which has no substance, and only leaves its colour or a greasy trace, like olive oil and the like, there is no need to remove it.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Majmu‘ (1/456): If there is some wax, dough, henna or the like on one of his limbs, and it prevents water from reaching any part of that limb, then his wudu is not valid, whether it is on most of the limb or only on a small area. If what remains on his hand or other limb is a trace and the colour of henna, not its substance, or a trace of liquid grease, such that water still touches the skin of that limb and runs over it, but does not remain there, then his wudu is valid. End quote.\nIbn Shata al-Bakri (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nTraces of ink and henna do not matter. What is meant by traces is mere colour, such that if you scratch it, for example, nothing comes off.""(I‘anat at-Talibin\xa01/35).\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: If there is a layer of a greasy substance, specifically Vaseline, does it prevent the water from reaching the skin? What must a person do if he did wudu and prayed many prayers with this, when it was still on his hand, without him realising that the grease prevents water from reaching the skin? How can he get rid of this greasy substance?\nHe replied: Lotions that have no substance do not prevent water from reaching the skin, whether they come in the form of oil or grease or some other type of lotion that has no substance. They do not prevent water from reaching the skin.\nBut if it is something that has substance and leaves a trace that prevents water from reaching the skin, then you should remove it; whether it is on your hand, your face or your foot, you should remove it. If you rub your hand or face or foot with something that has no substance and nothing is left of it – rather it only leaves a trace of which you feel some sensation and the like – this does not prevent the water from reaching the skin and there is nothing wrong with that. That which prevents water from reaching the skin is that which has substance that forms a barrier between the water and the skin.""(Fatawa Ibn Baz\xa0 5/245).\nBased on that, if the sunblock has substance and does not dissolve in water, then wudu and ghusl done with it on the skin are not valid, and you must repeat the prayers that you offered after you did wudu having put sunblock on your skin.\nYou should try to work out the number of these prayers, and try to err on the side of caution so as to absolve yourself.\nBut if the sunblock did not have any substance, or it had substance but it dissolved when water touched the skin, then it does not matter if you were wearing it.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/426969/he-used-to-put-sunblock-on-his-face-and-do-wudu
11035,"The Quran says (what means) ""Angels and Gabriel ascend to Allah in a day equivalent to 5000 terrestrial years.” Does this imply that Allah is controlling the earthly matters sitting on the Throne? Then how can it be that Allah is nearer to us than the veins?","['Praise be to Allah.Is Allah above the Throne?\nIt is proven in the Quran and Sunnah (prophetic teachings) and by the consensus of the Salaf (early generations) of this Ummah (global Islamic nation) that Allah is above His heavens over His Throne (as befits His Majesty), and that He is the Exalted, Most High. He is above all things, and there is nothing that is above Him. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \xa0\n{Allah, it is He Who has created the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them in six days. Then He\xa0rose over (istawa) the Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty). You (mankind) have none, besides Him, as a Wali (protector or helper) or an intercessor. Will you not then remember (or receive admonition)?} [As-Sajdah 32:4] \xa0\n{Surely, your Lord is Allah Who created the heavens and the earth in six days and then rose over (istawa) the Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty), disposing the affair of all things.} [Yunus 10:3]\n\xa0{To Him ascend (all) the goodly words, and the righteous deeds exalt it (i.e. the goodly words are not accepted by Allah unless and until they are followed by good deeds).} [Fatir 35:10]\n\xa0“He is the First (nothing is before Him) and the Last (nothing is after Him), the Most High (nothing is above Him) and the Most Near (nothing is nearer than Him).} [Al-Hadid 57:3]\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “You are the Most High and there is nothing above You…”\nThere are many similar verses and prophetic narrations. But at the same time, Allah tells us that He is with His slaves wherever they are:\n{Have you not seen that Allah knows whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on the earth? There is no najwa (secret counsel) of three but He is their fourth (with His Knowledge, while He Himself is over the Throne, over the seventh heaven), — nor of five but He is their sixth (with His Knowledge), — nor of less than that or more but He is with them (with His Knowledge) wheresoever they may be.} [Al-Mujadalah 58:7]\nAllah has combined mention of His being above His Throne with mention of His being with His slaves in one ayah (verse), where He says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n{He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six days and then rose over (istawa) the Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty) . He knows what goes into the earth and what comes forth from it, and what descends from the heaven and what ascends thereto. And He is with you (by His Knowledge) wheresoever you may be.} [Al-Hadid 57:4] \xa0\nHow is Allah close to us?\nSaying that Allah is with us does not mean that He is mixed with (or dwells in) His creation; rather He is with His slaves by His knowledge. He is above His Throne and nothing is hidden from Him of what they do. With regard to the verse (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n{And We are nearer to him than his jugular vein (by Our Knowledge).} [Qaf 50:16]\xa0\nMost of the exegetists said that what is meant is that He is near by means of His angels whose task it is to record people’s deeds. And those who said that it means that He is near explained it as meaning that He is near by His knowledge, as is said concerning how He is with us.\nThis is the view of Ahl As-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah (followers of prophetic guidance), who affirm that Allah is above His creation and that He is also with His slaves, and they state that He is far above dwelling in His created beings.\xa0\nWith regard to the denial of all Divine attributes as voiced by the Jahmiyyah (a deviant sect) and their followers, they deny that His Essence is above His creatures and that He rose above His Throne, and they say that He is present in His Essence everywhere. We ask Allah to guide the Muslims.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11035/is-allah-above-the-throne
230308,"Some brothers put posts on a local Facebook page in their city when the time for prayer begins, saying “Prayer is better than Facebook.” What we have noticed is that some members of the page comment on that, denouncing this phrase and saying that they know nothing except the phrase “Prayer is better than sleep.” Is there anything wrong with using this phrase?","['Praise be to Allah.I put this question to our shaykh, ‘Abd ar-Rahman al-Barrak (may Allah preserve him), and he replied that there is nothing wrong with that, because it comes under the heading of reminding people to do good, and it does not matter that what they say resembles the phrase “Prayer is better than sleep.”\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/230308/reminding-people-of-prayer-by-saying-prayer-is-better-than-facebook
8599,Is it permissible for a Muslim to give Salams to a Muslim when he is praying or he is making Dhikr or Du`a?,"['Praise be to Allah.Can you give Salam to someone who is praying?\nIt is prescribed for a Muslim to initiate the greeting of Salam to his Muslim brother when he is praying , but the one who is praying should not return the Salams whilst praying, except by making a gesture in a manner that will maintain the validity of his prayer.\nIt was narrated that Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I asked Bilal, How did the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) return their Salam when they greeted him whilst he was praying? He said, With a gesture of his hand.” (Narrated by Ahmad, 6/12; Abu Dawud, 1/569, no. 927; At-Tirmidhi, 2/204, no. 368; Al-Bayhaqi, 2/262; also narrated by the five)\n\xa0It was also narrated from him that Suhayb (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I passed by the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) whilst he was praying. I greeted him with Salam\xa0and he responded with a gesture .” And he said: I am not sure whether he said “a gesture with his fingers.” (Narrated by the five, apart from Ibn Majah. At-Tirmidhi said: both hadiths are sahih (authentic) in my view).\n\xa0It was reported that Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: I heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbidding us to pray two Rak`ahs after `Asr, then I saw him praying them when he prayed `Asr. She said, he entered and there were some women from Bani Haram, from among the Ansar, with me. He started to pray them [these two Rak`ahs after `Asr], so I sent a young girl to him, and I told her, `Stand beside him and say to him, Umm Salamah is saying to you, O Messenger of Allah, I heard you forbidding us to do these two Rak`ahs and now I see you praying them. If he makes a gesture with his hand then leave him and go back.’ So the young girl did that and he made a gesture with his hand, so she left him and went back. When he finished praying, he said: `O daughter of Abu Umayyah, you asked about the two Rak`ahs after `Asr. Some people from Banu `Abd Al-Qays came to me and kept me from doing the two Rak`ahs after Dhuhr, and that is what these were.’” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim)\n\xa0These hadiths indicate that it is prescribed to say Salams to a person whilst he is praying, and that he should respond to the greeting with a gesture , because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) approved of initiating the Salam, and he returned the greeting with a gesture only.\nCan you give Salam to someone who is making Dhikr and Du`a?\nIt is prescribed for the Muslim to initiate the greeting to one who is engaged in making Dhikr or Du`a. It was reported that Abu Waqid Al-Laythi (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “Whilst the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was sitting in the mosque and there were some people with him, three people came in. Two of them came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and one went away. When they came up to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), they greeted him with Salam. One of them found a space in the circle and sat down, and the other sat down behind him. The third one turned and went away. When the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had finished (his talk), he said: `Shall I tell you about these three people? One of them turned to Allah so Allah accepted him; the second felt shy so Allah will feel shy (to punish him); and the third turned away so Allah turned away from him.” (Narrated by Malik in Al-Muwatta’, 2/960; Ahmad, 5/219; Al-Bukhari, 1/24, 122; Muslim, 4/1713, no. 2176; At-Tirmidhi, 5/73, no. 2724; Abu Ya`la, 3/33, no. 1445)\nAnd in As-Sahihayn it is narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that a Bedouin entered the mosque and prayed, but he did not do the Ruku` and Sujud properly. Then he came and greeted the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) with Salam . The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) returned his greeting then said, “Go back and pray, for you have not prayed.”\nAnd Allah is the Source of strength. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad and his family and Companions, and grant them peace.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/8599/can-you-give-salam-to-someone-who-is-praying
