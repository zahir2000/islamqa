114800,"I had some secretion that was streaked with blood, and I purified myself from it, but some of it got onto my underwear, and I forgot to change this underwear, and I prayed. What is the ruling on this prayer, is it valid or invalid?","['Praise be to Allah.Your prayer is valid, and you do not have to do anything, because whoever prays with some impurity [on him or his clothing] that he was not aware of, or he was aware of it then he forgot it, his prayer is valid according to the more correct scholarly view. al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) attributed this view to the majority of scholars and favoured this view. ""(Al-Majmu‘\xa0 1/163).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If a person forgets that impurity got onto him, and he did not remember until after he said the salaam at the end of the prayer, then he must repeat the prayer according to the author’s view, because he broke one of the conditions of the prayer, which is avoiding impurity, so it is as if he prayed without wudu’, forgetting that he had broken his wudu’.\nThe same applies if he forgets to wash off the impurity.\nThe more correct view concerning all these issues is that he does not have to repeat the prayer, whether he forgot [about the impurity] or he forgot to wash it off, or he was unaware that it had got onto him, or he was unaware that it was an impurity, or he was unaware of the ruling, or he was unaware of it before the prayer or after the prayer.\nThe evidence for that is the important general principle which Allah set out for His slaves, which is mentioned in the verse (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Allah does not place on any soul a burden greater than it can bear. For it is what it has earned, and against it is what it has committed. Our Lord, do not hold us accountable if we forget or fall into error}\xa0[Al-Baqarah 2:286].\nThis man who did this haram action was unaware of the ruling or forgot, and Allah has spared him accountability for it, so nothing further is required of him.\nThere is evidence which specifically addresses this issue, which is that when the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) prayed wearing shoes on which there was something filthy, and Jibril informed him of that, he did not start the prayer again from the beginning. If this did not render the first part of the prayer invalid, then it should not render the remainder of the prayer invalid.""(Ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘\xa0 2/232).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/114800/she-forgot-to-remove-the-impurities-from-her-clothes-and-prayed-wearing-them
27093,What are the factors which cause a widening gap between Muslim and christian communities?.,"['Praise be to Allah.Basic Tenets of Islamic Belief\xa0\xa0\nThere are many great factors that widen the gaps between Muslims and Christians. The differences in belief between us and them do not let us get close unless they give up their disbelief and misguidance, and join the monotheists who believe in One Lord and God, and bear witness that the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is His Messenger, and believe that `Isa (Jesus – peace be upon him) was a human being.\nBasic Tenets of Christian Belief\nThese are the most significant deviations in their religion, which widen the gap between us Muslims and them:\xa0\n\nThe Messiah (peace be upon him) is a god alongside God and that he is the second person of the holy trinity .\nThe Messiah is the son of God .\nDivinity may be incarnated in humanity.\nGod is formed of three\xa0 coequal consubstantial divine persons, which is known as the doctrine of the trinity.\nThe Messiah (peace be upon him) was crucified by the Jews on the command of Pontius Pilate, and that he died on the cross.\nThe Messiah died on the cross as a ransom for mankind and as expiation for original sin .\nThe Christian attitude towards the Jews who disbelieved in Jesus (peace be upon him) and claimed that they crucified him and killed him, and they accused his mother Mary (Maryam - peace be upon her) of fornication – of which she was innocent – yet despite all that their attitude towards them today is one of support and loyalty, and their attitude towards the Muslims who venerate Jesus (peace be upon him) and his mother is one of enmity and disavowal.\nTheir distortion of the Book of God, the Gospel (Injil), whether they distorted the words by changing them or by adding words, or they distorted the meaning, and in doing that they attribute things to God that cannot be attributed to Him.\nThe doctrine of redemption, which is their belief that God sent His only son to redeem mankind from a sin committed by the father of mankind (Adam – peace be upon him), but God was unable to forgive his sin, so He sent His only son who had no sin, to sacrifice himself in order to do away with sin. This is an attribution of imperfection to the Lord of the Worlds and a denial of the fact that Adam (peace be upon him) repented and Allah saved the Messiah (peace be upon him) from death.\nTheir disbelief in the Prophethood of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), even though he is mentioned in the Old and New Testaments.\nTheir belief in the soundness of the distorted Torah that they have in front of them today, which contains insults against God, describing Him as having shortcomings, and insults against the Prophets and Messengers, saying things that one can hardly dare utter, but we mention them in order to highlight the abhorrent nature of the disbelief that they follow. They describe God as weeping with regret for the Flood which drowned the people of Noah, until His eyes became sore, and the angels came to visit Him – exalted be He far above that.\n\nThey describe Lot (peace be upon him) as committing incest with his two daughters, and Noah (peace be upon him) as drinking wine until he became drunk and his `awrah (private parts) was exposed. There are even more foolish stories than that.\xa0\nSee Hidayat al-Hayara fi Ajwibat al-Yahud wa’l-Nasara by Ibn al-Qayyim; Naqd al-Nasraniyyah by Dr. Muhammad ibn ‘Abd-Allah al-Sahim\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/27093/differences-between-christianity-and-islam
109859,"A man rented his wife’s house for seventy thousand dirhams, to be paid by his work, and twenty-four thousand dirhams will be deducted from his salary. The question is: is the money that his wife will receive subject to zakah? Please note that the husband and wife are living in this house.","['Praise be to Allah.Yes, zakah must be given on the rent that the wife receives, if one full year has passed. The year is to be counted from the time when the rental contract is drawn up, and at the end of that year she must give zakah on it or on what remains of it, if it reaches the minimum threshold (nisab), at a rate of 2.5%. If she has spent it all and has not saved anything of it, then no zakah is due on it.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin was asked, as it says in Majmu‘ al-Fatawa (18/question no. 110):\nWhat is the ruling on zakah on money that a person receives for apartments that he rents out, as he does not receive the rent for one apartment all in one go; rather he receives it in two or three payments?\nHe replied:\nAll the rent that a person receives little by little, if he spends it when he receives it, no zakah is due on it, so long as one year has not passed since the rental contract was drawn up.\nOne example of that is a man who rents out an apartment for ten thousand, and at the end of the year he receives ten thousand. In this case he must give zakah on it, because one year has passed since the contract was drawn up.\nAnother man received the rent in full in advance – meaning that the landlord received it at the time of drawing up the contract, then he spent it. In this case no zakah is due on it, because one full year did not pass since it was received, and one of the conditions of zakah being obligatory is that one full year should have passed.\nAs for the apartment itself, it is not subject to zakah, because anything that is prepared for rental is not subject to zakah, such as real estate, cars,\xa0 equipment and so on, except jewellery made of gold or silver, which is subject to zakah every year in all cases if it reaches the minimum threshold (nisab).

276,"In a discussion among Muslims, we were trying to arrive at a definition of ""love"" in Islam. Though we are all well aware of the love of Allah and our obligation to love both Him and His Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him), we wondered if there is a clear outline of love between humans (similar to the Christian ""brotherly love""...NOT the romantic variety). Some posited that ""love"" lies only within the family, all else is but respect/friend- ship/etc. Others questioned whether love is limited to spouses and/or children. Still others questioned if love can be conditional or not. One idea is that ""love"" (as the term is commonly used) may even be an 'innovation' of sorts, based on fairy tales and Christian philosophy. Many of us have looked in various sources to seek out an ""answer"", but no one has found a definitive answer as of yet... Can you help?","[""Praise be to Allah.Types of love in Islam\nI was very happy to hear that you and your fellow Muslim sisters are studying Islamic issues and trying to find out about Islamic views of love. No doubt, you and your sisters understand the importance of the scholars’ views and referring to them in matters of dispute. I will quote here a number of views about love, so that you will understand the matter better, in sha Allah\nLove in Islam may be divided into specific love and general love.\nTypes of specific love\nSpecific love may be divided into types that are permissible and types that are prohibited.\n\nPermissible love:\n\n\nLove of Allah : This is the most important obligation, as it is the basis of Islam. By perfecting one’s love of Allah, one perfects their faith. If one’s love of Allah is lacking, then one’s Tawhid is also lacking. The evidence for this is the verses (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n“But those who believe, love Allah more (than anything else)” [Al-Baqarah 2:165]\n“Say: If your fathers, your sons, your brothers, your wives, your kindred, the wealth that you have gained, the commerce in which you fear a decline, and the dwellings in which you delight are dearer to you than Allah and His Messenger, and striving hard and fighting in His cause, then wait until Allah brings about His Decision (torment). And Allah guides not the people who are Fasiqun (rebellious, disobedient).” [Al-Tawbah 9:24]\nThere are also other similar proofs in the Quran and Sunnah.\nThe love of Allah may also take the form of preferring what Allah loves and wants of His slave over what the slave himself might love and want. So he loves what Allah loves, hates what He hates, takes as friends or regards as enemies for His sake, and adheres to His laws. There are many ways to strengthen this type of love.\n\nLove of Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him): This is also one of the most important duties of Islam. Indeed, faith is not complete until a person loves the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) more than he loves himself, as in the Hadiths:\n\nThe Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: “None of you truly believes until I am more beloved to him than his child, his father and all the people.” (Reported by Muslim, no. 44)\n‘Abdullah ibn Hisham (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “We were with the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him), and he was holding the hand of ‘Umar ibn Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him); ‘Umar said to him: O Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him), you are dearer to me than everything except my own self. The Prophet (peace be and blessings upon him) said: No (that is not right), by the One in Whose Hand is my soul, (not) until I am dearer to you than your own self. ‘Umar said to him, now, by Allah, you are dearer to me than my own self. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: Now (you are right), O Umar.” (Reported by Al-Bukhari, no. 6632).\nThis love is part of loving Allah and is manifested by following the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) and giving precedence to his opinion over that of others.\n\nLove of the Prophets and the believers: This is obligatory because loving Allah dictates that one should love the people who obey Him, namely, the Prophets and righteous people. The evidence for this is the Hadith: “Whoever loves for the sake of Allah (i.e., loves the people of faith for the sake of Allah ) … has perfected faith”\xa0\n\nObedience to Allah is based on the love of Allah. Faith cannot be perfected except in this way, even if one has a lot of prayers and fasting to their credit. ‘Umar ibn Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I have witnessed at the time of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him), none of us would think that he had more right to his own money than his Muslim brother.”\n\nForbidden love :\n\n\nThis includes love that constitutes Shirk (ascribing rivals to\xa0 Allah), which is when a person loves something instead of Allah or as much as Him. In such a case he has taken that thing as a rival to Allah. This is the Shirk of love, and most people have taken things as rivals to Allah in love and glorification.\nThere are also types of forbidden love which do not go to the extent of Shirk, such as loving one's family, wealth, tribe, business or house, and preferring those things, in whole or in part, over doing the duties that Allah requires of him, such as Hijrah (migration for His sake), Jihad, etc. The evidence for this is the verse quoted above “Say: If your fathers, your sons, your brothers, your wives, your kindred, the wealth that you have gained, the commerce in which you fear a decline, and the dwellings in which you delight . . . are dearer to you than Allah and His Messenger, and striving hard and fighting in His cause, then wait until Allah brings about His Decision (torment).” [Al-Tawbah 9:24])\n\nTypes of general love\nGeneral love is of three types:\n\nNatural love, such as the love of a hungry person for food, or a thirsty person for water. This does not involve any kind of glorification, so it is permissible.\nLove based on mercy and pity, such as the love of a father for his small child. This also involves no kind of glorification, so there is nothing wrong with it.\nLove based on acquaintance and friendship, such as that between those who share a common profession, or scholars in the same field, or people one meets on a daily basis (such as fellow-commuters), or people one does business with, or travelling-companions. This type of appropriate love between people or between fellow Muslim brothers does not imply Shirk or associating anyone else in one's love for Allah.\n\nFor more information, please see Kitab Taysir al-Aziz, Bab wa min al-nas man yattakhidhu min dun-Allahi andadan.\nWe hope that this explanation makes the matter clearer.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/276/types-of-love-and-their-ruling
