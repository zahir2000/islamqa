421269,When did Adam accept the trust? Was that before he ate the fruit? Or was it when he was on earth? Or do we not know about that?,"['Praise be to Allah.Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Indeed, we offered the Trust to the heavens and the earth and the mountains, and they declined to bear it and feared it; but man [undertook to] bear it. Indeed, he was unjust and ignorant}\xa0[Al-Ahzab 33:72].\nIbn Jarir at-Tabari said in his Tafsir (20/337): the view that is most likely to be correct is the view of those who said that what is meant by the trust in this context is all types of trust in terms of religion, and trusts between people. That is because Allah did not specify any particular type of trusts when He said {we offered the Trust}. End quote.\nIbn Kathir said regarding the difference of opinions among the commentators of the earlier generations regarding the meaning of the trust: All these views do not contradict one another; rather they are agreed on tracing the meaning back to accountability and accepting the commands and prohibitions with their condition, which is that if man undertakes that he will be rewarded and if he neglects it he will be punished. And man accepted that despite his weakness, ignorance and wrongdoing, except those whom Allah helps and guides. And Allah is the one Whose help we seek.End quote from his Tafsir (3/522).\nSecondly:\nWith regard to when Adam took on the trust, it is only narrated from Ibn ‘Abbas in his commentary on the verse (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Indeed, we offered the Trust to the heavens and the earth and the mountains, and they declined to bear it and feared it; but man [undertook to] bear it. Indeed, he was unjust and ignorant}\n[Al-Ahzab 33:72] that he said:\nIt was offered to Adam, and Allah said: Take it with all that it entails; if you obey you will be forgiven, and if you disobey I will punish you.\nAdam said: I accept.\nAll it took was the time between ‘Asr and nightfall on that day, before he committed the sin.\xa0Narrated by at-Tabari (20/327).\nThus it becomes clear that Adam took on the trust when he was still in paradise, before he came down to earth and before he ate from the tree from which he had been forbidden to eat.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/421269/what-is-meant-by-the-trust-which-adam-took-upon-himself-and-when-did-that-happen
419460,"How can one beseech Allah, may He be glorified, and call upon Him by mentioning one’s vulnerable situation? Is it by telling Allah, may He be exalted, of my weakness and what is on my mind, like getting something off my chest, and is it permissible to do that in the prayer?","['Praise be to Allah.Tawassul or beseeching Allah, may be done by virtue of His names and attributes; or by virtue of one’s righteous deeds, such as the supplicant saying: “O Allah, I ask of You by virtue of the fact that You are Allah, there is no god worthy of worship except You, the One, the Eternal Refuge,” or, “O Allah, I ask You by virtue of Your knowledge and Your mercy,” or, “O Allah, I ask of You by virtue of my love for You and my love for Your Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).”\nThis tawassul is proven in the sahih Sunnah.\nSee the answers to questions no. 979 and 3297 .\nAnother type of tawassul that is prescribed is to beseech Allah by virtue of your need for Him, as Allah, may He be exalted, tells us that His Prophet Ayyub (peace be upon him) said (interpretation of the meaning): {Indeed, adversity has touched me, and you are the Most Merciful of the merciful} [al-Anbiya’ 21:83], or by virtue of your admitting your wrongdoing and your need for Allah, as He, may He be exalted, tells us that His Prophet Yunus (peace be upon him) said (interpretation of the meaning): {There is no god worthy of worship except You; exalted are You. Indeed, I have been of the wrongdoers} [Al-Anbiya’ 21:87].\nIf what is meant is beseeching Allah by virtue of your difficult situation, this is mentioning your need for Allah, and there is nothing wrong with that, because expressing your poverty, need and humility is one of the means of having your supplication answered, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {Call upon your Lord in humility and privately; indeed, He does not like transgressors} [Al-A‘raf 7:55].\nHumility means humbling oneself and submitting. See: Zad al-Masir (2/129).\nMentioning one’s difficult situation and vulnerability comes under the heading of complaining, and complaining to Allah is prescribed in Islamic teachings and is not contrary to patience. If it comes in the context of supplication, it is good because it is expressing vulnerability and humility.\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Complaining to Allah is not contrary to patience, as noted above regarding the complaint of Ya‘qub to Allah, even though he said (interpretation of the meaning): {so patience is most fitting} [Yusuf 12:18].\nAs for telling other people about one’s difficult situation, if that is for the purpose of seeking advice or help, or seeking assistance to remove the harm, that is not contrary to patience, such as a patient complaining to a doctor about his problem, or one who has been wronged telling someone who could help and support him, or one who is going through trials complaining to someone who he hopes could relieve him of his troubles. When the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) visited the sick person he would ask him about his condition and would say: How are you? He asked that in order to find out about him and how he was doing.""(‘Iddat as-Sabirin, p. 271).\nSo there is nothing wrong with a person complaining to his Lord, telling him about his situation and vulnerability and what he is feeling, then following that with expression of his humility and need by asking his Lord to relieve him of distress and meet his need. So telling Him about your difficult situation and vulnerability is a means of beseeching Him before offering supplication, whether that is done in the prayer or otherwise.\nThere is a hadith which mentions complaining about one’s situation by saying, “O Allah, to You I complain about my lack of strength, lack of resources and people’s careless attitude towards me…”, but its isnad is not sahih.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/419460/how-can-one-beseech-allah-by-mentioning-ones-vulnerable-situation
