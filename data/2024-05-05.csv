432487,"what works against us when we are in some beneficial worldly pursuit like education, exercise, business etc (because most people are undisciplined)? In psychology, it's called 'Resistance'. They use the word for a force that works against us, when doing anything difficult in the short term but beneficial in the long term.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nPersonal discipline in goals, whether worldly or religious, is the essence of effectiveness and achievement. Personal discipline can be defined as the ability to do what you must do, when you must do it, whether you feel the desire and motivation to do it or not.\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: ""A strong believer is better and dearer to Allah than a weak believer, and there is good in both. Adhere to whatever brings you benefit, seek the help of Allah, and do not feel helpless. If something befalls you, do not say: \'Had I done such-and-such, it would be such-and-such.\' Indeed,\'if\' opens the way before the devil to act."" Reported by Muslim (2664), from the narration of Abu Hurairah (may Allah be pleased with him).\nThe Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) used to seek refuge in Allah from incapacity and laziness. Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) would say: ""O Allah, I seek refuge with You from incapacity, laziness, cowardice, senility, and miserliness. And I seek refuge with You from the torment of the grave. And I seek refuge with You from the trials of life and death."" Reported by Al-Bukhari (2823) and Muslim (2706).\nIncapacity is a person\'s failure to do what they should do, thinking they are unable to do it, while laziness is a person\'s failure to do what they must do, despite knowing they are capable of doing it.\nBoth of these traits are the opposite of self-discipline, and the final result is a decrease in a person\'s effectiveness and inability to achieve their goals and fulfill their responsibilities.\nSecondly:\nThe reasons that prevent a person from self-discipline and hinder them from performing their tasks are varied, and some of them can be mentioned as follows:\n(1) The absence of a network of sequential procedures made up of small parts that lead us to the goal. Consider Salah, for example. Allah did not simply say, ""Pray,"" but He legislated a network of procedures distributed over times, supported by collective action, which ultimately leads us to achieve this goal. You will find small preparatory steps before each Salah, such as the alerting call to prayer, then purification, and walking calmly to the prayer, and so on.\nThe idea of small steps is important in the Shari`ah. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: ""The most beloved deed to Allah is the one that is consistent, even if it is small."" Reported by Muslim (782). \'Aishah said about the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him): ""His deeds were consistent."" Reported by Al-Bukhari (1987).\nSimilarly, there is the gradual legislation of fasting and the gradual prohibition of alcohol. Always gradual steps, taking into account the conditions of the people, what they can bear, and what is best for their affairs.\n(2) The absence of final deadlines for accomplishment. Consider Salah again, and how each prayer has a beginning and an end time, as does fasting.\n(3) The desire for perfection and doing something perfectly, or not doing it at all. This desire ultimately results in not doing it at all. The revelation invalidates this idea, as Allah says (translation of the meaning): {So fear Allah as much as you are able}\xa0(At-Taghabun 64:16), and the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: ""Let one of you pray with vigor, and if he becomes weary, let him sit down."" Reported by Al-Bukhari (1150) and Muslim (784).\n(4) Lack of clarity in daily tasks or excessive daily tasks. Focus should be on two or three goals that have a significant impact on your most important project. Once you have completed them, move on to a subsidiary list, where you have recorded a number of other tasks related to your major project or others. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: ""O people, take on the deeds that you can handle; for Allah does not tire until you tire. And the most beloved deeds to Allah are those that are consistent, even if they are small. The family of Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) would establish a deed and adhere to it."" Reported by Al-Bukhari (1151) and Muslim (782).\n(5) Working on several large projects at the same time and being scattered among them.\n(6) Starting a large task without sufficient preparation, or without possessing appropriate skills, or without having the right tools.\n(7) Excessive involvement in social activities and time-wasting activities.\n(8) Neglecting times for personal entertainment and enjoyment.\n(9) Neglecting to draw on the experiences of others, or their efforts, and completely turning away from collective work where it is required and needed.\n(10) Not understanding the emotions that hinder achievement and not being able to deal with them.\nThirdly:\nThe basic skills that self-discipline is a part of are called ""executive skills,"" and here we recommend a book titled ""Smart but Scattered,"" which we hope will help you more precisely identify the problems and ways to address them.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/432487/reasons-for-lack-of-discipline-in-beneficial-pursuits

To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Who is it that can intercede with Him except by His permission?

Al-Hayy is the One with perfect life, which includes all the attributes of Allah\'s Essence: such as Knowledge, Might, Power, Will, Greatness, Majesty, and other sacred\xa0attributes of His Essence.\nAl-Qayyum is the One with perfect self-subsistence and it has two meanings:\nThe first meaning: He is the One who is self-subsisting, His attributes are magnificent, and He is independent of all His creation.\nThe second meaning: He is the One by Whom the earth and the heavens and all their creatures subsist.

Al-Wahidi says: ""And His (Exalted be He) statement {Al-Qayyum} Al-Qayyum linguistically\xa0is an intensive form of Al-Qa\'im (the One who stands/exists), and its pattern is Fa`yul, and its root is: Qaywum, but when the \'ya\' and \'waw\' came together, and the preceding is a sukun, they were made into a shaddah of \'ya\', and it is not permissible to be on (Fa`ul), because if it were so, it would have been Qawwman.\nIt has three dialects: Qayum, Qayyam, and Qayyim.\n... As for its meaning: Mujahid said: Al-Qayyum: the One Who stands (exists) over everything, and its interpretation: that He stands by managing the affairs of creation, in their creation and their sustenance. And Ad-Dahhak said: Al-Qayyum: the One Whose existence is perpetual.\nAbu `Ubaidah: He is the One Who does not cease. Due to the uprightness of His attribute of existence, where change is not permissible in any way.\nAnd it is said: It means the Knower of affairs, from their saying: So-and-So stands by this book, meaning: He is knowledgeable about it,"" End quote.\nAt-Tafsir Al-Basit"" (4/ 347 - 348)"".\nAt-Tibi said: ""(Al-Qayyum) .. its meaning is the One Who stands (exists) by Himself and sustains others, and this is absolutely and generally only correct for Allah, the Exalted, for His self-subsistence does not depend in any way on others, and the subsistence of everything is by Him; as the existence and continuity of things cannot be conceived except by His existence,"" End quote.\n""""Sharh Al-Mishkah"" by At-Tibi: (6/ 1803).\nAmong those who stated that the name of Allah, Al-Qayyum, conveys the meaning of existence is ""Ibn Abi Al-`Izz Al-Hanafi,"" who said (may Allah have mercy on him): ""And from it: that He is Al-Qayyum Who does not sleep, as He is uniquely free from sleep and slumber, unlike His creation, for they sleep. And in this is an indication that the negation of anthropomorphism is not meant to negate the attributes, but rather He, Exalted be He, is described with the attributes of perfection, due to the perfection of His Essence.\nSo, the Ever-Living with an everlasting life does not resemble the living with a transient life, and for this reason, the worldly life is enjoyment, amusement, and play, and indeed, the Hereafter is the true life. Thus, the worldly life is like sleep, and the life of the Hereafter is like wakefulness.\nIt is not said: So this life of the Hereafter is perfect, and it is for the creature: because we say: The Ever-Living Whose life is from the attributes of His Essence that are inherent to it, He is the One Who granted the creature that perpetual life, so it is lasting by Allah\'s making it last, not that permanence is an inherent attribute of it by itself, unlike the life of the Lord, Exalted is He. And likewise, all His other attributes, so the attributes of the Creator are as befits Him, and the attributes of the creature are as befits it.\nKnow that these two names, I mean: the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of [all] existence, are mentioned together in the Quran in three Surahs as previously mentioned, and they are among the greatest names of Allah, to the extent that it was said: They are the Greatest name, for they encompass the affirmation of the attributes of perfection in the most complete and truthful manner, and Al-Qayyum indicates the meaning of Eternality and Everlastingness that the term Al-Qadim (the Ancient) does not indicate.\nAnd it also indicates His existence by Himself, which is the meaning of His being necessarily existent.\nAl-Qayyum is more eloquent than Al-Qayyam because the \'waw\' is stronger than the \'alif\', and it implies His standing/existing\xa0by Himself, by the agreement of the interpreters and the linguists, and it is known by necessity. And does it imply His sustaining others and His standing over them? There are two opinions, the most correct of which is: that it does imply that. And it implies the permanence of His standing/existence and the perfection of His standing/existence, due to the intensification in it, for He, Exalted be He, does not fade nor does He wane, for the fading one has certainly ceased, meaning: He does not disappear, nor diminish, nor perish, nor become non-existent, rather He is the Everlasting, the Remaining, who has always been and will always be, described with the attributes of perfection. The conjunction with the Ever-Living necessitates all other attributes of perfection, and indicates their permanence and continuity, and the absence of deficiency and non-existence from them eternally and perpetually. And for this reason, His statement (translation of the meaning): {Allah - there is no deity except Him, the Ever-Living,\xa0the Self-Sustaining.} [Al-Baqarah: 255] is the greatest verse in the Quran, as it has been established in the authentic [narrations] from the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him),"" End quote.\n""Shark At-Tahawiyyah"" (1/ 90 - 91).\nSecondly:\nIt has been mentioned in several answers that it is permissible to describe Allah, the Exalted, as (Existing), and that the existence of Allah is known from the religion by necessity, and it is an attribute of Allah by the consensus of the Muslims, so it is reported about Him and (He is) described with it, but it is not one of His Beautiful Names (Al-Asma\' Al-Husna).\nShaykh Al-Islam (may Allah have mercy on him) said: ""And He, Exalted be He, is Ancient and\xa0\xa0necessarily existent, the Lord of everything and its Sovereign, He is the Creator and all else is created,"" End quote.\n""Clarification of the Confusion of the Jahmiyyah"" (1/304).\nHe also said: ""For Allah truly exists, and the servant truly exists, and this is not like that,"" End quote.\n""Majmu` Al-Fatawa"" (5/198).\nIt is a word and meaning in Arabic, as is known from the books of language, and although the phrase ""Allah\xa0Exists"" is not from the speech of the ancient Arabs, nor from their known poetry or prose; but it is common on the tongues of the scholars.\nIt is used in the context of Allah with two meanings: affirming Him, Exalted be He, and negating His non-existence, eternally and perpetually.\nAnd affirming knowledge of Him also, so whoever seeks Him, finds Him, and knows Him, Exalted be He.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/393714/allahs-name-al-qayyum-as-proof-of-his-existence
105356,How should the sick person purify himself and pray? I hope you will explain that in detail.,"['Praise be to Allah.How sick person\xa0make Wudu\n\nThe sick person has the same obligations as a healthy person with regard to purification with water from minor and major impurity, so he should do Wudu in the case of minor impurity and Ghusl in the case of major impurity .\nBefore doing Wudu, it is essential to clean oneself with water (Istinja’) or with stones or whatever takes their place, after urinating or defecating.\n\nWhen cleaning oneself with stones, it is essential to use three clean stones. It is not permissible to clean oneself with dung, bones or food, or anything that is respectable. The best is to clean oneself with stones and the like, such as tissue and so on, then to follow that with water, because the stones remove the impurity itself and the water purifies the place, so that is best.\xa0\nOne has the choice between cleaning oneself with water or with stones and the like. If he wants to limit it to just one of the two, then water is better, because it purifies the place and it removes the impurity itself and its traces, so it is more effective in cleaning. If he limits himself to stones, then three stones are sufficient if the place becomes clean after that; if that is not sufficient then he may add a fourth or a fifth, until he has cleaned the place, but it is better to stick to an odd number.\xa0\nIt is not permissible to clean oneself with the right hand, but if the left-hand is cut off, or it is broken or diseased and the like, then he may clean himself with his right hand on the basis of necessity, and there is nothing wrong with that.\xa0\n\nIf the sick person cannot do Wudu with water because he is unable to, or because he is afraid that it will make his sickness worse or delay his recovery, then he should do Tayammum . Tayammum means striking his hands on pure dust once, then wiping his face with the inside of his fingers and palms.\n\nIt is permissible to do Tayammum using anything pure on which there is dust, even if it is not the ground, such as if the dust can fly off a wall or the like, it is permissible to use it for Tayammum. If he remains in a state of purity from the first Tayammum, he may pray with it, as is the case with Wudu, even if that is several prayers, and he does not have to renew his Tayammum, because it is an alternative to water, and the alternative comes under the same ruling as the thing it replaces.\xa0\nTayammum is invalidated by everything which invalidates Wudu, and it becomes invalidated as soon as one becomes able to use water or water becomes available, if it was not available.\xa0\n\nIf the sickness is minor, and there is no fear that using water will cause harm or cause severe sickness or delay recovery or increase the pain or cause anything harmful, such as headaches, toothache and the like, or the patient can use warm water and will not be harmed by it -- in these cases it is not permissible to do Tayammum, because it is permitted in order to ward off harm, but there is no harm in these cases, and because he can find water, so he is obliged to use it.\nIf it is too difficult for the sick person to do Wudu or Tayammum himself , someone else should do Wudu or Tayammum for him, and that is acceptable.\nIf a person has wounds or ulcers or broken limbs or any sickness in which using water would harm him, and he becomes Junub, it is permissible for him to do Tayammum. If he is able to wash the sound parts of his body, he must do that and do Tayammum for the rest.\nIf a person has a wound in one of the parts of the body that are washed during Wudu, if washing it with water is too difficult for him or will harm him, he may wipe it with water instead of washing the injured part, according to the normal sequence of Wudu. If it is too difficult for him to wipe it or if doing so will harm him, he may do Tayammum for it, and that is acceptable.\nFor the one who is wearing a dressing -- which means that there is a bad break in one of his limbs and it is wrapped up or the like -- he may wipe over it with water and that is sufficient, even if he was not in a state of purity when he put it on.\nWhen the sick person wants to pray, he must strive to make sure that his body, clothes and the place where he wants to pray are free of impurities, but if he cannot do that, he should pray as he is, and there is no blame on him.\nIf the sick person is affected by urinary incontinence and has not recovered with treatment, then he must clean himself (Istinja’) and do Wudu for every prayer after the time for it begins, and he must wash off whatever has got onto his body or clothes, or put on clean clothes for prayer if it is not too difficult for him to do so, otherwise he is pardoned, but he should take precautions to prevent the spread of urine on his clothes or body or the place of his prayer, by putting a cloth over the head of the penis.\n\nHow sick people offer prayer\n\nThe sick person must pray standing as much as he can.\nIf he cannot stand, then he may pray sitting, but it is better for him to sit cross-legged at the times when one normally stands during prayer.\nIf he is unable to pray sitting, he may pray lying on his side facing towards the Qiblah. It is recommended for him to lie on his right side.\nIf he is unable to pray on his side, he may pray lying on his back with his feet towards the Qiblah.\n\n\nIf a person is able to stand but he is unable to bow or prostrate, then standing is not waived in his case; rather he should pray standing, and lean forward for rukoo’, then sit and lean forward for sujood.\nIf there is some sickness in his eye, and a trustworthy doctor has told him, “if you pray lying on your back then it will heal, otherwise it will not,” then he may pray lying on his back.\nIf he is unable to bow and prostrate, he may lean forward for them, and he should lean lower for prostration than for bowing.\nIf he is unable to prostrate only, then he should bow and lean forward for prostration.\nIf he cannot bend his back, he should bend his neck, and if his back is bent so that it is as if he is bowing, then when he wants to bow he should lean forward a little, and make his face as near to the ground as he can when prostrating.\nIf he cannot tilt his head forward, he should say takbeer and recite Quran, and intend in his heart the standing, bowing, rising, prostration, rising, sitting between the two prostrations and sitting to recite the tashahhud, and he should recite all the prescribed Adhkar. As for what some sick people do of gesturing with the finger, there is no basis for it.\nIf the sick person becomes able, during his prayer, to do something that he was unable to do, such as standing, sitting, bowing, prostrating or leaning forward, he should start to do that and continue from what he has already done of his prayer.\nIf the sick person or anyone else sleeps and misses a prayer, or he forgets it, he must pray it when he wakes up from his sleep or when he remembers it, and it is not permissible for him to leave it until the time for the same prayer begins (the next day) and then pray it.\nIt is not permissible to stop praying under any circumstances, rather the accountable person must be keen to pray in all circumstances, whether he is healthy or sick, because it is the pillar of the faith and the most important obligation after the twin testimony of faith. So it is not permissible for the Muslim to fail to offer an obligatory prayer until the time for it has ended, even if he is sick, so long as he is of sound mind. Rather he must offer it at the proper time according to what he is able to do on the basis of the details mentioned above. As for what some sick people do of delaying prayers until they recover from their sickness , this is something that is not permitted and there is no basis for it in sharee’ah.\nIf it is too hard for the sick person to offer every prayer on time, then he may join Dhuhr and `Asr , and Maghrib and `Isha’, at the time of the earlier or later prayer, according to what is easy for him. If he wishes he may join `Asr with Dhuhr at the time of Dhuhr, or if he wishes he may delay Dhuhr and join it with `Asr; if he wishes he may join `Isha’ with Maghrib at the time of Maghrib, or he may delay Maghrib and join it with `Isha’.\n\nAs for Fajr, it cannot be joined with the prayer before it or after it, because its time is separate from the times of the prayers that come before and after it.\xa0\n(Shaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn `Abd-Allah ibn Baz, Shaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz Aal Ash-Shaykh, Shaykh `Abdullah ibn Ghadyan, Shaykh Salih Al-Fawzan, Shaykh Bakr Abu Zayd)']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/105356/can-i-pray-without-wudu-if-im-sick
