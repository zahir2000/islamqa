493239,"What is the ruling on traces of impurity (najasah) left after cleaning oneself with pebbles that may be overlooked, if they get onto the clothes or body?","['Praise be to Allah.Scholars differed regarding traces of impurity left after cleaning oneself with pebbles, if they move from their place onto the body or clothes.\nThe Hanafis are of the view that traces of impurity that remain after cleaning oneself with pebbles are overlooked, if they move onto the clothes or body.\nIbn al-Humam (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The later scholars are agreed that sweat is not regarded as impure (najis); even if it runs down the face and\xa0 more than the size of a dirham of it gets onto the clothes and body, it does not matter.""(Fath al-Qadir\xa0 1/214).\nThe Shafa‘i scholars are of the view that traces of impurity that are left after cleaning oneself with pebbles are to be overlooked, if they move from their place to the body or clothes.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If, as a result of sweating, the impurity moves from its place to another part of the body or the garment, either of the two rulings may apply, but the more correct view is that it is overlooked, because it is too difficult to avoid that.""(Rawdat at-Talibin\xa0 1/279).\nAr-Ramli (may Allah have mercy on him) said: What is left of traces of impurity in the place that was cleaned with pebbles may be overlooked, because it is permissible for him to limit himself to using pebbles, and if the place where the traces remain sweats, and the traces contaminate other parts of the body or clothing, that is also overlooked, because it is too difficult to avoid that.""(Nihayat al-Muhtaj\xa0 2/25).\nThe Hanbalis, according to the well-known view, say that it is not overlooked. This is based on their view that using pebbles only does not clean the impure place properly.\nAccording to the second view of their madhhab, it is overlooked, because using pebbles to clean oneself purifies the place. This was narrated from Imam Ahmad.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Heavy impurity may be overlooked because of its location in three cases, the first of which is the place that is cleaned using pebbles. Traces of impurity that are left after cleaning oneself with the required number of pebbles may be overlooked, and there is no difference of opinion as far as we know.\nOur companions differed as to whether the place that is cleaned using pebbles and in which some trases of impurity remain becomes pure:\nAbu ‘Abdillah ibn Haamid and Abu Hafs ibn al-Muslim were of the view that it becomes pure (even if some traces of impurity remain). This is the apparent meaning of Ahmad’s words, because he said, regarding one who had cleaned himself with pebbles and then sweats and the sweat gets onto his trousers: It does not matter.\nThe reason for that is what the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said regarding dried dung and worn-out bones: “They do not purify.” What may be understood from this is that other things do purify, because what is meant is that it removes the description of impurity as water does.\nOur later companions said: The place does not become pure; rather it remains impure. So if the one who had cleaned himself with pebbles [and some trace of impurity remained] were to sit in a small amount of water, that water would become impure, and if he were to sweat, his sweat would be impure, because wiping does not remove all the traces of impurity, so what remains of that is impure, because it is the trace of an impure substance.""(Al-Mughni\xa0 2/486 – at-Turki edn.).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin favoured the view that the small amount that remains after cleaning oneself with pebbles may be overlooked.\nIn his Sharh, he (may Allah have mercy on him) quoted the words of the author of az-Zad: The traces that remain after cleaning oneself with pebbles is overlooked if it remains in its place.\nFrom the phrase “in its place”, it is known that if the impurity goes beyond its place, it is not overlooked, such as if he sweats and his sweat runs down and passes through that place, and ends up on his trousers, garment or buttocks. In that case it is not overlooked, because it has gone beyond its place.\nFrom his words, it may be understood that cleaning oneself with pebbles does not purify, and that the traces left are impure, but may be overlooked if they remain in their place.\nBut the correct view is that if the conditions of cleaning oneself with pebbles are met, then it does purify.\nThe evidence for that is the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) concerning bones and dried dung: “They do not purify.” Its isnad is jayyid (good).\nThe Prophet’s words, “They do not purify,” indicate that cleaning oneself with other things that are permissible to use for that purpose does purify. Based on this view, which is the more correct view, if the traces of impurity go beyond their place, and travel with his sweat onto his trousers, his trousers do not become impure, because cleaning oneself with pebbles purifies, but there is no stipulation that he should use water too, so as to make it easier for the Muslims.""(Ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘ ‘ala Zad al-Mustaqni‘\xa0 1/445-446).\nBased on the above:\nThe more correct view is that what remains of a small amount of impurity after cleaning oneself with pebbles is overlooked, even if it moves onto the person’s garment or body, because this is what appears to have been the case from the conduct of the Sahabah: they would sweat and their garments would come in contact with traces of impurity left in place after cleaning themselves with pebbles, but it was never narrated from even one of them that they used to wash that away. Moreover, this matter is very difficult to avoid, yet there is nothing in the reports to suggest that there is any exception to the ruling on cleaning oneself with pebbles in the event of the traces of impurity getting onto the garment or body. This indicates that the matter is to be overlooked.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/493239/what-is-the-ruling-on-a-small-amount-of-impurity-najasah-left-after-cleaning-oneself-with-pebbles-if-it-gets-onto-the-body-or-clothes
20013,People say that no Qada’ (due) prayer can be offered immediately after the 'Asr' prayer. Please help by giving me a comprehensive answer regarding this saying.,"['Praise be to Allah.Forbidden prayer times\nThere are some times at which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) disallowed prayer . These are:\xa0\n\nFrom after Fajr prayer until the sun has appeared and risen to the height of a spear, i.e., approximately fifteen minutes. (Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti’, 4/162)\nThe time when the sun is at its zenith in the middle of the sky. This is a short time before the time for Dhuhr prayer begins, approximately one-quarter of an hour or twenty minutes. (Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 11/286). Some of the scholars said that it was shorter than that. Ibn Qasim (may Allah have mercy on him) said that it is a brief time period, not even long enough to pray, only enough to say the Takbir to start the prayer. (Hashiyat Ibn Qasim `ala Ar-Rawd Al-Murbi`, 2/245)\xa0\nAfter `Asr prayer until the sun sets.\xa0\n\nThese three times were mentioned in many Hadiths in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade praying at these times . These Hadiths include the following:\xa0\n\nAl-Bukhari (586) and Muslim (728) narrated that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: `There is no prayer after `Asr prayer until the sun has set, and no prayer after Fajr prayer until the sun has risen.’”\xa0\nMuslim (832) narrated that `Amr ibn `Abasah As-Sulami (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I said, `O Prophet of Allah, tell me what Allah has taught you and I do not know, tell me about the prayer.’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: `Pray Subh (Fajr) prayer, then do not pray until the sun has appeared and risen… then pray for your prayer is witnessed and attended (by the angels), until the shadow of a spear points due north\xa0 – which is the time when the sun is in the middle of the sky – then stop praying, for at that time Hell is stoked up. When the shadow turns – which is the beginning of the time for Dhuhr – then pray, for your prayer is witnessed and attended (by the angels), until you pray `Asr. Then stop praying until the sun sets…”\xa0\n\nCan we make up for a missed prayer after `Asr?\nWhat is meant by making up prayers is doing the prayer after the time for that prayer is over. The made-up prayer may be either obligatory or supererogatory.\xa0\n\nObligatory prayers: The Muslims must pray regularly at the times defined by Allah for each prayer. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n\n“Verily, the prayer is enjoined on the believers at fixed hours.” [An-Nisa’ 4:103]\nDelaying the prayer until its time is over without a reason or excuse is prohibited, and it is a major sin.\xa0\nIf the Muslim has an excuse, such as sleeping or forgetting, and he was not able to do the prayer on time, then he must make up the prayer when that reason no longer applies , even if that is at one of the times when prayer is disallowed. This is the view of the majority of scholars. (See Al-Mughni, 2/515)\xa0\nThe evidence for that is the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Whoever sleeps and misses the prayer or forgets it, let him pray it when he remembers .” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 597 and Muslim, 684)\xa0\n\nSunnah prayers : the scholars differed with regard to making them up at times when prayer is disallowed. The correct view is that they should be made up . This is the view of Ash-Shafi`i (may Allah have mercy on him). (See Al-Majmu`, 4/170) It was also the view favoured by Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him), as stated in Al-Fatawa, 23/127. This is indicated by a number of Hadiths, such as:\xa0\n\nThe report narrated by Al-Bukhari (1233) and Muslim (834) from Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her), that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prayed two Rak`ahs after `Asr, and she asked him about that. He said: “Some people from `Abd Al-Qays came to me and distracted me from praying two Rak`ahs after Dhuhr, so I did them now.”\xa0\nIbn Majah (1154) narrated that Qays ibn `Amr said: the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw a man praying two Rak`ahs after he had prayed Fajr prayer. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Are you praying Fajr twice?” The man said to him, “I did not pray the two Rak`ahs that come before it , so I offered them now.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) remained silent. This was classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah (984). Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: the fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) remained silent indicates that it is permissible. (Al-Mughni, 2/532)\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad and grant him peace.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20013/can-we-make-up-missed-prayer-after-asr
483121,"I prayed opposite to the direction of the qiblah without making the effort to work it out for more than a month, because I moved to a new apartment where I thought that the qiblah was in the same place. Should I repeat all the prayers? Can I pray them all at one time?","['Praise be to Allah.The worshipper should face towards the direction that he is certain is the qiblah, if he knows it. If he does not know the direction for sure, then he should make the effort to work it out, so that he will be praying in the direction that he thinks is most likely to be the qiblah.\nIf someone prays when he is unsure of the direction of the qiblah, and he is able to make the effort to work it out, then he is falling short and he must repeat the prayer.\nIbn ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe scholars are agreed that if someone prays not facing towards the qiblah and without making the effort to work it out, his prayer is not valid and he must repeat it facing towards the qiblah. This is similar to the case if he prayed without purifying himself.\nA similar ruling applies to the one who prays in a mosque where he can easily work out the qiblah from the mihrab and the like, but he does not do that, and prays facing a different direction.""(At-Tamheed\xa0 10/426).\nBut if he put effort into trying to work it out and got it wrong, then his prayer is valid and he does not have to repeat it.\nIbn ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nExamining this issue leads us to conclude that the individual does not have to repeat the prayer that he offered facing what he thought was the direction of the qiblah after making the effort to work it out, because its direction was not clear. That is because he has done what he was commanded to do and he has done what was required of him of making the effort to seek indications of the qiblah, then he thought that he was facing the right direction, then after he had prayed he realized that he had made a mistake.\nThe scholars are agreed that in this case, he did what is permissible for him to do and, in fact what he was obliged to do (that is, put effort into working out the direction). However, they differed as to whether he has to make up that prayer, if it became clear to him that he had made a mistake regarding the qiblah. Suggesting that he must repeat it means that it is obligatory, and what is obligatory cannot be proven except on the basis of certainty with no room for doubt.""(At-Tamhid\xa0 10429).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe correct view is that if he put effort into working it out when he was not travelling, then his prayer is valid. If he got it right, then the matter is clear; if he did not get it right, meaning that he put effort into working it out but got it wrong, he will still have reward for his effort. If he put effort into trying to work it out, he does not have to repeat the prayer at all, whether he got it right or not, because he did what was required of him. The one who has done what is required of him has done what he could to protect himself from the punishment of Allah, and whoever does what he can to protect himself from the punishment of Allah does not have to pray twice, because Allah has not obliged His slaves to do any act of worship twice, if they do it in the manner enjoined…\nSummary of the matter:\n1. If someone puts effort into trying to work it out, his prayer is valid, whether he got it wrong or right, and whether he is travelling or not, according to the more correct scholarly view.\n2. If he prayed without putting effort into trying to work it out and was not following someone else, then if he got it wrong, he must repeat the prayer, and if he got it right he does not have to repeat it, according to the correct view.""(Ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘\xa0 1/286-287).\nThere are many ways to work out the qiblah; it is not limited to one way. Each of these ways could indicate its direction, so they are valid ways of working it out.\nIbn ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe scholars are unanimously agreed that anyone who is far away from the Ka‘bah must turn his face towards it, so the one who cannot tell in what direction it is may look for whatever he can that will indicate its direction, such as the stars, the mountains, the winds and so on, from which he will be able to work out its direction.""(At-Tamheed\xa0 10/426).\nThe easiest way to work out the direction of the qiblah nowadays, which is the most readily available to people, is using a compass which shows the direction of the qiblah, especially as they are available on most modern cell phones, and there is no longer any need for a specialized instrument that may not be available to the Muslim when he needs it.\nIf you neglected to use the compass on your cell phone, even though you were aware of it and were aware of the importance of finding out the direction of the qiblah, then you must repeat your prayers.\nBut if it never crossed your mind, or you were not aware that it was there on your phone, or you did not know how to use it to find out the direction of the qiblah, and you made an analogy between your new apartment and your old apartment, and you believe that they faced the same direction, then we may note that analogy is one of the ways of finding things out, and we hope that there will be no blame on you for what you did, and that you have done what you could.\nBut if you think that you fell short and did not put enough effort into trying to work it out in order to be certain of the direction of the qiblah and find out its indications, or if you want to be on the safe side and be free of blame, then erring on the side of caution in such matters is a good idea.\nBased on that, you must repeat the prayers that you offered when you were not facing towards the qiblah. Making up prayers is to be done in the correct order and is to be done immediately, if you are able to do that.\nThe Permanent Committee for Academic Research and Ifta’ was asked:\nWhat is the order of making up Fajr, Zuhr and ‘Asr prayer when a person remembers that he has not prayed?\nAnswer: Making up missed prayers must be done immediately, and must be done in the proper order, as enjoined by Allah, may He be glorified. This means praying Fajr, then praying Zuhr, then praying ‘Asr.\nAnd Allah is the source of strength. May Allah send blessings upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.\nPermanent Committee for Academic Research and Ifta’\nShaykh ‘Abdullah ibn Munayyi‘, Shaykh ‘Abdullah ibn Ghadyan, Shaykh ‘Abd ar-Razzq ‘Afifi\nEnd quote from Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah – Vol. 1 (6/159).\nConclusion:\nWith regard to someone who prayed not facing towards the qiblah, if he put sufficient effort into trying to work it out and did what was required of him, then it turned out that he was not facing towards the qiblah, the prayer that he offered is valid and he does not have to repeat the prayer.\nBut if he was heedless about looking for indications of the qiblah, or he fell short in his efforts, he must repeat the prayers that he offered not facing towards the qiblah. He must offer them in order, to the best of his ability.\nIf he fears that he may have been negligent or did not put enough effort into finding indications of the qiblah, then it is a good idea for him to err on the side of caution and make up the prayers that he offered not facing towards the qiblah.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/483121/he-prayed-not-facing-towards-the-qiblah-for-a-month-does-he-have-to-repeat-the-prayers
