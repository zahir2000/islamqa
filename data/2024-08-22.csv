470045,Are our salawat conveyed to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) at times other than Friday?,"['Praise be to Allah.Our blessings (salawat) upon the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) are conveyed to him at all times, as is proven in the sound hadiths. It was narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has angels who travel around on earth, conveying to me the salaams of my ummah.” An-Nasa’i (1282); classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih an-Nasa’i (1215).\nIt was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no one who sends greetings of salaam to me but Allah will restore my soul to me so that I can return his greeting of salaam.” Narrated by Abu Dawud (2041). Its isnad was classed as jayyid (good) by al-‘Iraqi in Takhrij al-Ihya’ (2/764). It was classed as hasan by Shaykh al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud (1779).\nSecondly:\nThe conveying of our blessings (salawat) upon the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on Friday is something special that is distinct from other days. If it is encouraged to do a good deed at a specific time or in a specific place or situation, that indicates that it has a distinct virtue in that case. We may or may not understand that distinct virtue, because basically it is an act of worship, so it is not essential to understand it.\nIn the hadith it is narrated that Aws ibn Aws said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The best of your days is Friday. On it Adam was created, on it he died, on it the trumpet will be sounded, and on it all people will swoon. So send a great deal of blessings (salawat) upon me on that day, for your blessings\xa0\xa0 will be conveyed to me.” They said: O Messenger of Allah, how will our blessings be conveyed to you when you have turned to dust? He said: “Indeed Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has forbidden the earth to consume the bodies of the prophets.” Abu Dawud (1047); classed as sahih by al-Albani.\nSome of the scholars found some distinctive qualities in the conveying of the blessings (salawat) on that specific day, which are mentioned in the context of explaining the reason why it is encouraged to send a great deal of blessing upon the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on that day. They are as follows:\n-1-\nSending blessings (salawat) upon the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is one of the best acts of worship, and it is better on Friday than on other days, because it is singled out for a reward that is seventy times greater than on other days. The fa’ in the words “fa inna salatakum ma‘rudatun ‘alayya (for your blessings will be presented to me)” explains the reason mentioned. In other words, they will be presented to me as gifts are presented to their recipients. Thus they are virtuous deeds that will bring you closer to me, as a gift brings the giver closer to the recipient. As this is the case, then we should do a great deal of that at virtuous times, for righteous deeds increase in virtue when done at virtuous times, therefore the blessings will be conveyed to the Prophet on a day that is better than other days. See: Sharh Sunan Ibn Majah by al-Harari (7/49).\n-2-\nFriday is a day that is witnessed by the angels, and this witnessing by the angels on Friday makes the blessings more virtuous than on other days, and the angels’ conveying of the blessings is more important than on other days. According to the version narrated by Ibn Majah from Abu’d-Darda’: “Send a great deal of blessings on me on Friday, for it is witnessed; the angels witness it.” See: Sharh Sunan Abi Dawud by Ibn Ruslan (7/351).\n-3-\nSending blessings (salawat) upon the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is a supplication (du‘a’), and on Friday there is an hour when supplications are answered. So part of proper etiquette with the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and part of acknowledging his rights is praying for blessing upon him at such times, so that the blessing will be conveyed to the Prophet when there is the hope that this supplication will be answered.\n-4-\nFriday is singled out as being a day of extra virtue for some acts of worship, such as walking to the prayer, offering supplication and reading Surat al-Kahf. Similarly, sending blessings upon the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on Friday has a special virtue, and the conveying of blessings to the Prophet is better on that day than on other days.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/470045/are-our-salawat-conveyed-to-the-prophet-blessings-and-peace-of-allah-be-upon-him-at-times-other-than-friday
98477,"What is the ruling on a man removing excessive hair from his face with a thread? Whether it is on the beard, between the eyebrows or on the forehead?","['Praise be to Allah.Is it permissible for men to remove hair from the beard?\nIt is not permissible for a man to remove anything from his beard because of the many Hadiths which enjoin leaving it alone and letting it grow. The definition of the beard is that which grows on the jawbones, cheeks and chin.\xa0\nCan men pluck hair from the forehead or between eyebrows?\nAs for hair other than that, such as the hair that grows on the forehead and between the eyebrows , there is nothing wrong with removing it according to some scholars.\xa0\nOthers are of the view that it is not allowed, especially if it is removed by plucking, with a thread or otherwise.\xa0\nWhat is Namas?\xa0\nThe reason for the difference of opinion is the difference of opinion about the meaning of the word Namas (plucking) which is mentioned in the Hadith which curses the one who does that.\xa0\nSome of them interpreted it as specific to the eyebrows and some interpreted it as including all facial hair. Namas is prohibited for both men and women, because it is changing the creation of Allah, and there is no difference between men and women in this case.\xa0\n\nThe first view – which is that Namas applies only to the eyebrows – was held by a number of scholars, and the scholars of the Standing Committee issued Fatwas on that basis. They stated that it is permissible to remove facial hair apart from the beard and eyebrows.\nThe second view – which is that Namas refers to removal of all facial hair – was held by many scholars and was favoured by Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him), who said it is not allowed for men to pluck hair from their faces.\xa0\n\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked): What is the ruling on plucking grey hairs from the hair and beard?\xa0\nHe replied:\xa0\n“With regard to the beard or facial hair it is prohibited, because this is Namas. Namas means plucking the facial hair, of which the beard is a part, and it was proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed the woman who plucks facial hair and the woman who has that done. We say to this man: if you were to look for every hair that has turned white and pluck it out, you would have no beard left. So leave what Allah has created as He created it and do not pluck anything.\xa0\nBut if it refers to plucking hair from the head, it does not reach the level of being prohibited, because that is not Namas.” (Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin, 11/123)\xa0\nIt seems – and Allah knows best – that Namas refers specifically to removing hair from the eyebrows. Based on that, there is nothing wrong with a man removing hair from his face other than the beard and eyebrows.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/98477/can-men-pluck-hair-from-the-forehead-or-between-eyebrows
178188,What is the ruling if a man shuns his wife for five consecutive months?,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt is not permissible for a man to shun his wife for this length of time, unless she is defiantly disobedient, meaning that she disobeys him and does not fulfil his rights. In that case, it is permissible to shun her until she repents, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{As for those women on whose part you fear defiant disobedience, [first] admonish them, [next] refuse to share their beds, [and last] hit them [lightly]. Then if they obey you, take no further action against them. Verily, Allah is Most High, Great}\xa0[an-Nisa’ 4:34].\nBut if these methods do not succeed in dealing with the defiant disobedience on the part of the wife, then the man should choose an arbitrator from his family and she should choose an arbitrator from her family, who can then examine the problem and decide on a solution, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{If you fear a breach between them, appoint an arbitrator from his family and another from hers; if they both want to put things right, Allah will bring about reconciliation between them. Verily, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Aware}\xa0[an-Nisa’ 4:35].\nBut if there is no defiant disobedience, it is not permissible to shun the wife in this way for two reasons:\n1.. The husband is obliged to keep his wife chaste, so he must have intercourse with her according to what she needs and according to what he is able to do.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about a man who is able to keep away from his wife for a month or two months without having intercourse with her; is he sinning or not? Should the husband be asked to have intercourse with her?\nHe replied: The man must have intercourse with his wife on a reasonable basis, and this is one of the most important rights that she has over him. It is more important than feeding her. With regard to what is obligatory in terms of intercourse, it was said that it is obligatory once every four months, or that it should be according to what she needs and according to what he is able to do, just as he should feed her according to what she needs and according to what he is able to do. The latter is the more sound of the two scholarly views.""(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa\xa0 32/271).\n2.. If he refuses to have intercourse with his wife – when there is no issue of defiant disobedience – for four months, he comes under the ruling on one who has vowed not to have intercourse with his wife. Therefore he should be ordered to have intercourse with her or to divorce her, and if he refuses to divorce her, the judge should issue a divorce.\nThe scholars of the Permanent Committee said: Regarding someone who shuns his wife for more than three months, if that is because of her defiant disobedience – meaning that she disobeys her husband with regard to the marital duties that are obligatory for her, and she persists in that after he admonishes her and reminds her to fear Allah, may He be exalted, and he reminds her of the duties that she must fulfil towards her husband – then he may shun her for as long as he wishes, so as to discipline her until she willingly fulfils her duties towards her husband. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) shunned his wives and did not visit any of them for a month. As for not speaking to her, it is not permissible for a man to ignore his wife for more than three days, because of the hadith that was narrated soundly from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) by Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which he said: “It is not permissible for a Muslim to shun his brother for more than three days.” Narrated by Imam al-Bukhari and Muslim in their Sahihs, and by Ahmad in his Musnad.\nWith regard to a husband forsaking his wife in bed for more than four months in order to cause harm to her, when there is no shortcoming on her part in fulfilling her husband’s rights, in this case he is like one who has vowed to keep away from his wife, even if he did not actually swear an oath to that effect. So the deadline of the vow to keep away from his wife (ila’) is to be set for him, then if four months passes without him going back to his wife and having intercourse with her in the vagina, when he is able to have intercourse, and she was not menstruating or bleeding following childbirth, then he is to be ordered to divorce her. If he refuses to go back to his wife and he refuses to divorce her, the judge should issue a divorce, or annul her marriage to him, if the wife requests that.\nAnd Allah is the source of strength. May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions. End quote.\nShaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baz, Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz Al ash-Shakh, Shaykh Salih al-Fawzan, Shaykh Bakr Abu Zayd.\nEnd quote from Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah (20/261-262).\nSecondly:\nIf the husband was travelling, and his wife did not agree to him being away for more than six months, then she should refer the matter to the judge so that he can correspond with the husband and tell him that he must return. Then if he does not return, the judge may issue a verdict as he sees fit, either divorce or annulment of the marriage.\nIt is the same whether the husband’s travel and absence was for a valid reason, such as his need for money and there being no work available for him in his country, or there was no valid reason. But the difference between having a valid reason and not is that if the husband had a valid reason, he does not have to return and he is not sinning if he does not return.\nBut if he has no valid reason, then he must return, and he is sinning if he does not return.\nIn either case, the woman has the right to ask for a divorce, so as to ward off the harm that she is suffering. We have discussed this previously in the answer to question no. 102311 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/178188/he-shunned-his-wife-for-five-consecutive-months
105391,What are the situations in which Ghibah (backbiting or talking about others in their absence) is permitted?,"['Praise be to Allah.The scholars have stated that Ghibah is permitted in certain situations :\xa0\n\nComplaining . It is permissible for the one who has been wronged to complain to the ruler or judge and others who have the authority or ability to settle the score with the one who wronged him.\xa0\n\n\nSeeking help to change evil and bring the sinner back to the right path, so he may say to the one who he hopes is able to do something: “So and so is doing such and such; tell him not to do it.”\xa0\n\n\nSeeking advice or a Fatwa (religious ruling), by saying to the scholar, “So and so/my father/my brother has wronged me by doing such and such, does he have the right to do that? How can I solve this problem and ward off his harm from me?”\xa0\n\n\nWarning the Muslims of someone’s evil, such as highlighting the weakness of some reporters or witnesses or authors. That also includes seeing someone buying faulty goods, or someone keeping company with one who is a thief or adulterer, or giving a female relative of his to such a man in marriage, and the like. You should tell them about that by way of sincere advice, not with the aim of causing harm and spreading mischief.\xa0\n\n\nIf a person openly commits evil or follows Bid`ah (innovation), such as drinking alcohol and seizing people’s wealth unlawfully, it is permissible to speak of what he is doing openly, but it is not permissible to speak against him any other way, unless it is for another reason. \xa0\n\n\nFor identification, if someone is known by a nickname such as the dim-sighted one, or the blind man or the one-eyed or the lame one, it is permissible to identify him as such, but it is impermissible to mention that by way of belittling him, and if it is possible to identify him in some other way, that is better.\xa0\n\nIt says in Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah lil-Ifta’:\xa0\n“Speaking about a person in his absence is permissible in certain situations as indicated by Shar`i Islamic legal) evidence, if there is a need for that, such as if someone consults you about arranging a marriage to him, or entering into a business partnership with him, or if someone complains to the authorities to put a stop to his wrongdoing. In that case there is nothing wrong with saying things about him that he may not like to be said, because there is an interest to be served by that. One of the scholars summed up in two lines of poetry the situations in which it is permissible to talk about a person in his absence, and said:\xa0\nCriticizing is not Ghibah in six (cases) – complaining, identifying, warning,\nWhen the person is committing evil openly, when advice is sought, and when one is asking for help in removing an evil.”\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/105391/when-is-backbiting-allowed-in-islam
