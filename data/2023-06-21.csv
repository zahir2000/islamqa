270561,"I am a young Egyptian man who is about to get married. We have a bad custom in Egypt which is called al-qa’imah (the list), where the list is made of everything that the husband and wife have bought, and if the husband divorces his wife, he returns to her all the things that are written in the list. My question is: we agreed to buy 30 g of gold, and the bride’s family agreed to that, but that is on condition that 70 g be written in the list. Please note that the marriage is not done according to our custom until after this list has been drawn up. Is this permissible?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe mahr (dowry) is the right of the wife, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And give the women [upon marriage] their [bridal] gifts graciously}\xa0[an-Nisa’ 4:4].\nWhat is meant by {graciously} is an obligatory gift given willingly, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to one who wanted to get married: “Go and look for something, even if it is a ring of iron.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (5121) and Muslim (1425).\nThere is nothing wrong with the dowry being gold or cash or furniture, to be given immediately or at a later date, or some of it to be given immediately and some of it at a later date, according to what the husband and the woman’s guardian have agreed upon.\nIf you bought 30 g of gold, and the bride’s family want to wrote down 70 g of gold, there is nothing wrong with that. What it means is that 40 g of the mahr is to be paid at a later date.\nSecondly:\nThe custom in some countries is to buy furniture for the house with the husband’s wealth and the wealth of the wife’s family, then write that in the list as part of the woman’s mahr, then if divorce occurs, the woman takes what is in the list. There is nothing wrong with that either.\nSimilarly, there is nothing wrong with writing in the list something that is not yet present, so it will be a debt and mahr to be given at a later date.\nIf the furniture is made part of the mahr, then it belongs to the wife, and the fact that she brings it to the marital home means that she is giving permission to the husband to use it, but if any part of it is damaged, the husband does not have to replace it.\nIf divorce occurs, then she has the right to take this furniture as it is at the time of the divorce, and to take anything else that is written in the list, even if it has not yet been received, because it is part of the mahr to be given at a later date, as explained above.\nIt says in Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah (19/39): What is the Islamic ruling on the so-called list (al-qa’imah), which in our tradition should be written in the marriage document, and includes movable items that the groom brought or did not bring, and it is said that this serves an interest, because people are no longer honest, by analogy with the marriage certificate?\nAnswer: If the matter is as described, there is nothing wrong with mentioning them in the marriage certificate and both spouses signing for that, so that if any dispute arises that necessitates khul‘ (separation), what the husband gave will be clear and there will be no ambiguity concerning it. And Allah is the source of strength. May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.\nPermanent Committee for Academic Research and Ifta’\nShaykh ‘Abdullah ibn Qa‘ud, Shaykh ‘Abdullah ibn Ghadyan, Shaykh ‘Abd ar-Razzaaq ‘Afifi, Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn ‘Abdillah ibn Baz. End quote.\nIf a custom or tradition is not contrary to Islamic teachings, there is nothing wrong with following it.\nPerhaps the origin of this custom goes back to the well-known view in the Maliki madhhab which requires the wife to equip and furnish the marital home from her dowry, which they call ash-shawrah, and the husband has the right to make use of what the woman brings, and that he is not obliged to replace it [if it becomes damaged].\nAl-Hattab (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Mawahib al-Jalil (4/185): He may make use of her shawrah.\nWe have noted above that the shawrah is the furnishings and equipment that are needed in the home.\nWhat has been mentioned above about making use of her shawrah is correct. It says in ash-Shamil: He may make use of her shawrah, which is bought with her mahr, if she is obliged to provide furnishings and equipment for the home from her mahr, otherwise she does not have to do that. End quote. It is as if he is referring to what is mentioned in at-Tawdih and quoted by the author of ash-Shamil in Sharh al-Mukhtasar, that this ruling is based on the well-known view that the woman is obliged to provide furnishings and equipment for the home from her mahr. However, according to the odd view, she is not required to do so. End quote.\nAl-Khurashi said in Sharh Mukhtasar Khalil (4/187): It is permissible for the man to make use of the woman’s shawrah that she brought to the house and brought to his place, such as blankets, furnishings, clothing and so on. And he is not obliged to replace it.\nIn other words, the husband is not obliged to replace the first shawrah; rather he is obliged to provide that which she cannot do without.

111889,Is making the last prostration of the prayer lengthy for the purpose of offering supplication Sunnah? As many imams do that.,"['Praise be to Allah.Making the last prostration of the prayer lengthy for the purpose of offering supplication is not Sunnah; rather it is contrary to the Sunnah.\nAl-Bukhari (792) and Muslim (471) narrated that al-Bara’ ibn ‘Azib (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The prayer of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), his bowing, when he lifted his head from bowing, his prostration and his (sitting) between the two prostrations were almost all equal in length.\nShaykh Muhammad ibn Salih al-‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: With regard to making the last prostration longer than the other essential parts of the prayer, in order to offer supplication and pray for forgiveness in it, is there any problem with the prayer if the last prostration is made lengthy?\nHe replied:\nMaking the last prostration of the prayer lengthy is not Sunnah, because the Sunnah is to make all the actions of the prayer similar in length: bowing, rising from bowing, prostrating, and sitting between the two prostrations, as al-Bara’ ibn ‘Azib (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I observed the prayer of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and I noticed that his standing, his bowing, his prostration, and his sitting between the tasleem and departure were almost all equal in length. This is what is best. But there is a place for supplication other than prostration, namely the tashahhud. When the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) taught ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud the tashahhud, he said: “Then let him [the worshipper] choose whatever supplication he likes.” So he can make the supplication short or long, after reciting the final tashahhud and before saying the taslim. End quote.\nFatawa Nur ‘ala ad-Darb (tape no. 376, side B).\nShaykh ‘Abdullah al-Jibrin (may Allah preserve him) said:\nI do not see any evidence, and I have not read anything to suggest that the last prostration of the prayer should be made lengthy. But perhaps some imams do that to alert people to the fact that this is the end of the prayer, or the last action of the prayer, so they make it lengthy in order for people to realise that the sitting for the last tashahhud is approaching. If that is the case, it is not sufficient justification for making it lengthy. End quote.\nFatawa ash-Shaykh Ibn Jibrin: Ahkam Qat‘ as-Salah, Fatwa no. 2046), from his website.\nIn Fatawa Islamiyyah (1/258), he (may Allah preserve him) said:\nI do not recall any evidence to suggest that the last prostration should be made lengthy. Rather the hadiths speak of making all the essential parts of the prayer equal in length or almost equal in length.

392583,"There is a website called sovrntur.com – the way it works is as follows: when you subscribe to it, you are permitted to watch 10 ads and what you earn from each ad is a small amount of money. The price of ten ads is ten liras. The next day, you are allowed to watch ten more ads, and what you earn from that is approximately another ten liras, so the total is twenty liras. We add details of our bank account, and we can withdraw 92% of the total amount, which will arrive on the same day. As for the rest of the days, we cannot open other ads except in return for depositing a certain amount of money on the website. For example, if we deposit 200 liras, then we can open ten ads every day in return for ten liras, more or less, based on the price of the displayed ad. If we deposit 600 liras, we can open ten ads in return for thirty liras, more or less, based on the price of the displayed ad, and so on. The ads change according to the amount of money deposited. Of course, the amount will be returned two months after the date of the deposit. On the day on which we click on ads we make money, and on the day on which we do not click on ads we do not make any money. What we make is based on our work in the website, otherwise there is no money. This is the nature of the work we do on the website. What is the ruling on that? Please note that I have already deposited money, and every day I earn enough to cover a little less than my daily expenses. I hope that you can explain the ruling on this website, and the ruling on depositing money on it. If it is haram, what should I do?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt is permissible to make money by clicking on ads, subject to two conditions:\n1.\xa0The ads should be permissible, because clicking on the ad and having a lot of visitors to it is regarded as promoting and supporting it, and it is not permissible to advertise, promote or help in spreading evils, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And cooperate in righteousness and piety, but do not cooperate in sin and transgression. And fear Allah ; indeed, Allah is severe in penalty}\xa0[al-Ma’idah 5:2].\nAnd the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “And whoever calls others to misguidance will have a burden of sin like that of those who follow it, without it detracting from their burden in the slightest.” Narrated by Muslim (2674).\nSo it is not permissible to click on ads for permissive websites, or sites that sell intoxicants, or riba-based banks, or gambling sites, or missionary sites [that promote Christianity], or other websites that spread and propagate what is haram.\n2.\xa0The fee or payment should be known, such as if it says that if you watch an ad or click on it, you will receive such and such. If the fee is unknown, then the contract is not valid.\nSecondly:\nIt is not permissible to deposit money on the website, because from an Islamic perspective this is regarded as giving a loan to the website, which borrows the money. Borrowing means taking the money to make use of it and benefit from it, with a commitment to return it. It is not permissible to stipulate that a loan be given when entering into a transaction such as buying and selling, hiring or renting, or when paying a fee for some work.\nAt-Tirmidhi (1234), Abu Dawud (3504) and an-Nasa’i (4211) narrated from ‘Amr ibn Shu‘ayb, from his father, from his grandfather, who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “It is not permissible to arrange a loan combined with a sale.” Classed as sahih by at-Tirmidhi and al-Albani.\nWhat applies to buying and selling also applies to all other business transactions.\nIt says in a statement of the Islamic Fiqh Council regarding margins: Secondly: if the broker stipulates a condition for the customer that all his business should be done through him, then this leads to combining a loan and brokerage deal, which is like combining a loan with a sale, and that is prohibited according to Islamic teachings, as the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “It is not permissible to arrange a loan combined with a sale…”\nThis hadith was narrated by Abu Dawud (3/384) and by at-Tirmidhi (3/526), who said: It is a hasan sahih hadith.\nIn this case, he will be benefitting from his loan, and the jurists are unanimously agreed that any loan that brings a benefit comes under the heading of riba, which is prohibited.\nTo conclude, it is not permissible to deposit money on the website, no matter what the amount of money.\nWhat you must do is repent and withdraw your money.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/392583/making-money-by-clicking-on-ads-when-it-is-stipulated-that-one-must-deposit-money-on-the-website
