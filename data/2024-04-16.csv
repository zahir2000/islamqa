475342,Is there a hadith says “One prayer in al-Masjid al-Haram is equivalent to one hundred prayers in the Prophet’s Mosque”? This wording is quoted by some of the later scholars.,"['Praise be to Allah.We have not come across a report with the same wording and in the same order as that which is mentioned in the question, “One prayer in al-Masjid al-Haram is equivalent to one hundred prayers in the Prophet’s Mosque.”\nBut there is a report with the same meaning and similar wording, as was narrated by Imam Ahmad in al-Musnad (26/41-42) and by Ibn Hibbaan in al-Ihsan (4/499): It was narrated from Hammad ibn Zayd, from Habib al-Mu‘allim, from ‘Ata’ ibn Abi Rabah, from ‘Abdullah ibn az-Zubayr, who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “One prayer in this mosque of mine is better than a thousand prayers offered in any other mosque except al-Masjid al-Haram, and one prayer in al-Masjid al-Haram is better than a hundred prayers here” – meaning in the mosque of Madinah.\nThe narrators of this isnad are trustworthy (thiqat).\nThe commentators on al-Musnad said: The isnad is sahih according to the conditions of Muslim, and its narrators are trustworthy, the narrators of al-Bukhari and Muslim, except for Habib al-Mu‘allim. Al-Bukhari narrated a corroborating report from him and Muslim quoted some of his reports as evidence. End quote.\nWhat appears to be the case is that the wording mentioned in the question points to the same meaning as this hadith of Ibn az-Zubayr.\nA number of scholars stated that a report which gives the same meaning, but not the exact wording, may be accepted if the narrator is a scholar and he has the ability to avoid changing the meaning of the report when changing the wording.\nIbn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAt-Tirmidhi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAs for one who mentions the isnad precisely but changes the wording of the report, this is something that is widely practised by the scholars, provided that the meaning is not changed thereby…\nWhat at-Tirmidhi meant by this phrase that we have quoted here is that one who mentions the isnad precisely but changes the text without changing the meaning is still regarded as a trustworthy narrator whose narration carries weight.\nHe based that on the fact that narrating hadith on the basis of the meaning (not the exact wording) is acceptable, and he narrated that from the scholars. His words may give the impression that there is consensus, but that is not the case; rather it was the view of many of the scholars, and it was stated by Ahmad, who said: The scholars of hadith frequently narrate hadiths by giving the meaning (not the exact wording).\nBut that is only permissible for one who has knowledge of the language of the Arabs and their styles in expressing meanings, and who knows what phrases could alter the meaning and what phrases do not alter the meaning. This was stated by ash-Shafa‘i.""(Sharh ‘Ilal at-Tirmidhi\xa0 1/425-427).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/475342/is-there-a-hadith-which-says-one-prayer-in-al-masjid-al-haram-is-equivalent-to-one-hundred-prayers-in-the-prophets-mosque
1804,What does Islam say about life partner? Is she/he fixed by Allah or Allah has left it for us to decide?,"['Praise be to Allah.First of all, we should realize that there is no contradiction between our belief that Allah has decreed everything, and our belief that He has given us free will which enables us to do things. Confirming the free will of His slaves, Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""To whomsoever among you wills to walk straight"" [At-Takwir 81:28]\n\nOur will operates within the will of Allah , not outside of it, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""But you cannot will, unless Allah wills…"" [Al-Insan 76:30]\xa0\nThus it is not permitted to try to cancel one idea out with the other, or to deny either of them. Allah has confirmed both, that man has the power to choose, and that nothing can operate outside of His Will, may He be Glorified.\n\nIf we apply this to the question asked, we will see that man has freedom of will through which he can choose whichever woman he wishes to marry , and that whatever choice he makes has already been decreed by Allah.\xa0\nThe man’s choice is the means by which he gets what he wants, but some obstacles may come between the person and what he wants, in which case he will realize that Allah has not decreed this for him, for some reason which is known to Him.\nEverything that Allah does is good, and His slaves do not have knowledge of the Unseen or of how things will end. A person may regret missing out on something when it is good that he did not have it, or he may hate something that happens to him when it is good that it happened to him, as Allah tells us (interpretation of the meaning): ""… it may be that you dislike a thing which is good for you and that you like a thing which is bad for you. Allah knows but you do not know."" [Al-Baqarah 2:216]\n\nMay Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1804/is-ones-spouse-written-in-islam
328772,"In the Hadith of Jabir: The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) was delivering the sermon standing on Friday when a caravan from Sham arrived, and the people dispersed towards it, leaving only twelve men behind.

If not what is the method to hunt by a rifle so that the animal is Lawful?","['Praise be to Allah.If you shoot the deer with the rifle and mention the name of Allah, and hit the deer, and it dies from that shot, then it is lawful and it is permissible to eat it. If you catch up with it when it is still alive, it is essential that you slaughter it properly.\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Are the birds that we shoot with rifles and they died lawful or not? We find that some birds that we shoot have died before we can say the name of Allah over them.\xa0\nHe replied:\xa0\n“Yes, if you shoot with a rifle when hunting birds or rabbits or deer, and you say the name of Allah when pulling the trigger, then it will be lawful, even if you find it already dead, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whatever causes the blood to flow and the name of Allah has been mentioned over it, then eat.” And he said: “If you release your (hunting ) dog and mention the name of Allah over it, then eat.” But if it is still alive and able to move then you must slaughter it properly and mention the name of Allah over it when slaughtering it. If you do not do that and it dies, then it becomes prohibited for you. But attention must be paid to mentioning the name of Allah when pulling the trigger, because if you do not mention the name of Allah then it is prohibited to eat it, even if you forget, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whatever causes the blood to flow and the name of Allah has been mentioned over it, then eat.” And he said: “Do not eat of that over which the name of Allah has not been mentioned.”(Fatawa Nur `ala Ad-Darb)\xa0\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Is it sufficient for me to say Bismillah wa Allahu Akbar when inserting bullets into the rifle when hunting , or must I mention the name of Allah when pulling the trigger of the rifle?\xa0\nHe replied:\n“What you must do is mention the name of Allah when shooting, and it is not sufficient to mention the name of Allah when putting the bullets into the rifle, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When you shoot your arrow, then mention the name of Allah” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim, from the Hadith of `Adi ibn Hatim (may Allah be pleased with him); this version was narrated by Muslim).""(Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn Baz\xa0 23/91)\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/121239/is-hunting-with-a-gun-prohibited
