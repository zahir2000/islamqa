174279,"My question has to do with contraception using modern methods, which is done by using a rubber ring containing hormones that prevent pregnancy, by preventing the egg that has been fertilised from attaching itself to the wall of the uterus. Please note that other types of contraception prevent ovulation, and they differ from the first type by preventing fertilisation. Is the modern method mentioned above halal or haram? Please note that my question is not about contraception in and of itself; rather it is about this modern method.","['Praise be to Allah.The contraceptive rings work like pills, meaning that they prevent ovulation and prevent the fertilised egg from attaching to the wall of the uterus. On the website Tabib al-Web it says:\nThe\xa0vaginal ring\xa0is a flexible transparent\xa0copolymer\xa0ring, the diameter of which is 54 mm.\nThe woman herself places the ring in the vagina, where it remains for three weeks. In fact this ring contains a hormonal substance that is similar to what is found in contraceptive pills. The ring may remain in the vagina for three weeks, but the woman may remove it and wash it, then put it back in place easily. At the end of three weeks, the woman removes the ring, then waits for one whole week, like any woman who takes the contraceptive pill, then she inserts a new ring.\nThe way in which this method works is like the contraceptive pill, even though it is placed in the vagina; its effect is not localised, like other, local contraceptive methods; rather it works like the contraceptive pill, and placing it in the vagina is no more than a method of introducing the pharmaceutical substance into the body. In other words, these rings prevent ovulation from occurring, and make the interior of the uterus unreceptive to implantation of the egg. It also makes the cervical mucus unreceptive to the passage of sperm. End quote.\nThese rings share with other contraceptive methods – such as the IUD – the effect of preventing the fertilised egg from implanting in the uterus.\nIn the source quoted above it says: The way in which the IUD prevents pregnancy is by preventing the fertilised egg from implanting in the uterus.\nThe principle on which the copper IUD works is based on producing an inflammatory reaction that is not caused by germs; rather it is caused by the copper inside the uterus, as if the uterus is defending itself against the copper, so its make-up changes and it becomes unreceptive to implantation of the fertilised egg. This is in contrast to the hormonal IUD, which works by means of the pharmaceutical substance that the IUD releases inside the uterus and causes it to shrink.\nIn either case, the interior of the uterus becomes unreceptive to implantation of the fertilised egg. End quote.\nWe have previously explained that it is permissible to use the IUD to prevent pregnancy. Please see the answer to question no. 22027 .\nPreventing the egg from implanting in the uterus is not regarded as abortion, because abortion has to do with the fertilized egg that is implanted in the uterus, and this method prevents that from happening.\nAl-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his Tafsir: The nutfah (fertilised egg) is nothing, for certain, and no ruling is applied to it if the woman gets rid of it when it has not yet settled (implanted) in the womb, as it is regarded the same as if it is in the man’s loins. But if the woman gets rid of it when it is an ‘alaqah (embryo), then in that case we are certain that the nutfah had settled and begun to develop, in the first stage of development that leads to the formation of a child. End quote.\nAl-Ramli said in Nihayat al-Muhtaj (8/342): al-Muhibb al-Tabari said: The scholars differed regarding the fertilized egg before the completion of forty days, and there are two views. It was said that it is not subject to the rulings on abortion and infanticide, and it was said that it has sanctity and it is not permissible to harm it or cause it to be expelled after it has settled (implanted) in the womb. This is in contrast to ‘azl (coitus interruptus), because that happens before the sperm is deposited in the vagina… The more correct view is that it (abortion) is haram after the soul has been breathed into the foetus in all circumstances, but it is permissible before that. End quote.\nThe action of the IUD and the rings asked about is not regarded as abortion. Moreover, some of the jurists permit abortion of the fertilised egg before forty days, as was stated by al-Ramli and as has been explained previously in the answer to question no. 171943 .\nHence some contemporary scholars permitted the use of contraception based on the fact that ‘azl is permissible, and it is permissible to abort the fertilised egg before forty days, as if that indicates that it is permissible to use the IUD and similar methods.\nIt says in Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Da’imah (19/297): If contraception is used for a definite necessity – such as if the woman is not able to give birth naturally and must undergo a surgical procedure to extract the child, or if it is done to delay pregnancy for a while due to a valid reason that the spouses deem to be important – there is nothing wrong in that case with preventing or delaying pregnancy, based on what is narrated in the sahih hadiths and what was narrated from a number of the Sahabah about the permissibility of ‘azl, and in accordance with what the jurists have stated about it being permissible to take medicine in order to abort a fertilised egg before forty days have elapsed, and in fact it may become necessary to use contraception when it is proven that there is a strong reason for doing so.

82968,I am a young man and I do not want to get married. What should I do?,"['Praise be to Allah.Is marriage compulsory in Islam?\nYou should note that people are not equal in the matter of marriage. They share the fundamental principle that marriage is prescribed, which is from the guidance and practice of the Prophet, peace be upon him. Then, its importance varies in some cases more than others.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\nWith regard to marriage , people are of three types:\xa0\n\nSome fear that they may commit prohibited things if they do not get married. Such a person is obliged to get married, according to the majority of jurists, because he has to keep himself chaste and protect himself against engaging in prohibited actions, and the way to do that is getting married.\xa0\nFor some, marriage is recommended. This is the one who feels desire but there is no danger of his committing prohibited things. It is better for him to get married than to devote himself to optional acts of worship. This is the view of Ashab Ar-Ra`y and it is the view\xa0 and practice of the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them).\xa0\n\nIbn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: If I only had ten days to live and I knew that I would die at the end of them, and I had any desire to get married, I would get married, for fear of Fitnah (temptation).\xa0\nSa`id ibn Jubayr (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said to me: “Have you gotten married?” \xa0\nI said: “No.”\xa0He (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Get married, for the best of this Ummah are the ones with the most wives.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 5069)\xa0\nIbrahim ibn Maysarah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Tawus said to me: “Either get married, or I will say to you what `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said to Abu Az-Zawa’id (may Allah have mercy on him): Nothing is keeping you from getting married except impotence or immorality.” \xa0\n\nThose who have no desire, either because they were not created with any desire, such as one who is impotent, or they had desire but it has disappeared due to old age, sickness and so on. There are two opinions:\xa0\n\n\nIt is recommended to get married because of the general meaning of what we have discussed.\nIt is better for him to remain single because he cannot achieve the purpose of marriage, and he would be preventing his wife from becoming chaste by marrying someone else. Also, he would be harming her by keeping her for himself, and he is exposing himself to obligations and duties that perhaps he cannot fulfil, and he is distracting himself from seeking knowledge and worship with something that is of no benefit to him.\n\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The apparent meaning of the words of Ahmad is that there is no difference between the one who can afford it and the one who cannot. He said: a man should get married and if he can afford to spend he should spend, and if he cannot then he should be patient. \xa0\nThis applies to one who is able to get married. As for the one who cannot, Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And let those who find not the financial means for marriage keep themselves chaste, until Allah enriches them of His Bounty” [An-Nur 24:33].” (Al-Mughni, 9/341-344)\xa0\nReasons why marriage is so important\nAt this point, we would like to ask you about the reason for this aversion to marriage.\xa0\n\nIf you think that not getting married is an act of worship by means of which you can draw closer to the Lord of the Worlds, and you think that if you avoid marriage this will raise you in status before Allah, you are mistaken and there is the fear that you may be sinning.\xa0\n\nAnas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “Three people came to the houses of the wives of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asking about the worship of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). When they were told, it was as if they regarded it as too little. They said: Who are we in comparison to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)? Allah has forgiven his past and future sins. One of them said: As for me, I will pray all night forever. Another said: I shall fast all my life and never break my fast. Another said: I shall keep away from women and never get married. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came and said: “Are you the ones who said such and such? By Allah, I am the one who fears Allah the most among you and I am the most pious , but I fast and I break my fast, I pray and I sleep, and I marry women. Whoever turns away from my Sunnah is not of me.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 5063, and Muslim, 1401)\n\nIf you do not want to get married because you have no sexual desire, or you think that you are not able to fulfil the duties of marriage, and you are afraid of falling short in meeting a wife`s needs, I say to you: In that case there is no sin on you if you do not get married, but do not rely on your thoughts and notions. Rather you should consult a specialist doctor and ask him for advice, for he is most able to diagnose your condition, and he may have some advice for treatment that has never crossed your mind. So do not hesitate to visit him and do not let shyness stop you, for matters of medical treatment are not the place for shyness.\xa0\nIf you say that you are afraid because you are poor and do not have enough wealth to look after a family, I say to you: Try your best to earn a living and be content and think positively of Allah, for He has promised on the lips of His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that He will help the one who wants to be chaste and seeks that which is halal by getting married.\xa0\n\nAbu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There are three whom Allah is bound to help: the Mujahid who strives (in Jihad) for the sake of Allah, the Mukatib (a slave who has made a contract of manumission with his master) who wants to pay off his manumission, and a man who gets married, seeking to remain chaste.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi (1655), classed as sound by Al-Albani in Saheeh At-Tirmidhi) \xa0\n\nIf you have something that you want to achieve – such as a certificate, a position, a project and so on – and you say that you want to achieve that first, then you will get married, we say to you: Why are you ignoring marriage for that reason?\xa0\n\nMarriage has never been a barrier to achieving things, rather in most cases it is a support and a help. That is just the whisperings of the satan, which he has instilled in the minds of many young men so that it has become prevalent in our culture and society, and you hear many of those who have delayed their own marriages or the marriages of their sons and daughters saying such things, and our society has become burdened with problems resulting from large numbers of single men and women, and the delay of marriage. However, despite that we have not seen any achievement, development or progress, whereas the first generation of Muslims used to hasten to do good and they did not delay marriage, and their achievements were the greatest and most complete of achievements.\xa0\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Majmu` Al-Fatawa (20/421):\xa0\n“What is required is to hasten to get married, and no young man or young woman should delay marriage for the sake of studies, because marriage does not prevent any such thing. It is possible for a young man to get married in order to protect his religious commitment and morals, and enable him to lower his gaze . Marriage serves many purposes, especially in this day and age. Because delaying it is harmful for both young women and young men, every young man and every young woman should hasten to get married if there is a man who is compatible with the woman, and if a man can find the right woman.”\n\nOver and above all that, how about if you realise that marriage will protect half of your religion?\xa0\n\nAnas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whomever Allah has blessed with a righteous wife, He has helped him with half of his religion, so let him fear Allah with regard to the other half.” (Narrated by Al-Hakim in Al-Mustadrak, 2/175), At-Tabarani in Al-Awsat, 1/294) and Al-Bayhaqi in Shu`ab Al-Iman, 4/382) Al-Hakim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “This is a Hadith with an authentic Isnad (chain of narrators), although they (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) did not narrate it.” Adh-Dhahabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in At-Talkhis: it is authentic. It was classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Targhib, 2/192)\n\nHow about if you realise that by getting married, you will have followed the advice of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when he said:\xa0 “O young men, whoever among you can afford it , let him get married, for it is more effective in lowering the gaze and guarding one`s chastity.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 5065, and Muslim, 1400)\nHow about if you realise that by producing a righteous child, you will have ongoing charity (Sadaqah Jariyah), if you raise him with good morals and upon faith, and you will be rewarded for your marriage if you seek reward with Allah for that .\xa0\nBy getting married, you will be protecting yourself, lowering your gaze , and closing the door to one of the greatest means by which the devil deceives people. You may not feel the seriousness of that now, but Fitnah (temptation) may come from places a person does not realise, so you should be keen to close the door before it is opened without you realising it.\n\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I have not left after me any Fitnah more harmful to men than women.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 5096, and Muslim, 2741).\n\nMarriage is a source of tranquillity and peace, and it is the best of the pleasures of this world. In it, is that which Allah has made a sign for His slaves, and He has mentioned it in His Book so that they may think and ponder the greatness of His Might, may He be glorified and exalted. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n\n“And among His Signs is this, that He created for you wives from among yourselves, that you may find repose in them, and He has put between you affection and mercy. Verily, in that are indeed signs for a people who reflect.” [Ar-Rum 30:21]\nCan there be any hesitation after this?\xa0\nBe resolved and put your trust in Allah, and Allah will help you, and will provide you with a righteous wife who will help you to obey your Lord and He will bless you with righteous offspring who will be a stored treasure for you with Allah in the Hereafter.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/82968/is-it-prohibited-in-islam-to-not-get-married
105457,"What is the shar‘i ruling on the following situation? Someone gave some agricultural land of a known acreage to someone else as collateral for a loan of a specific amount of money, to be kept until he is able to pay off the loan. The lender will take possession of the land temporarily and make use of it, and he will keep its yield for himself and not give any of it to the borrower, until the debt is paid. The time period for this collateral may last for decades, and the lender will not give the land back to its owner until after the debt is paid off in full. Firstly: what is the ruling on the yield that the lender will keep for the duration of this period – is it halal or haram? What should the one who does that do if this action is haram – does he have to repent from it? Secondly: what should the borrower, who gave this land as collateral because he was forced to do so by his financial circumstances, do? Thirdly: what should the witnesses to this contract of collateral do? Please note that the borrower stated in this contract that he permitted the lender to make use of this land without being given any share of the yield or any rent until the debt is paid off.","['Praise be to Allah.The lender’s use of the collateral is subject to further discussion:\nFirstly: if he uses it and benefits from it without the permission of the borrower, then that is not permissible under any circumstances, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “It is not permissible to take the wealth of any Muslim except with his willing consent.” And he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Your blood, your property and your honour are sacred to you, as sacred as this day of yours, in this land of yours, in this month of yours.” And he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Every Muslim is sacred to his fellow Muslim, his blood, his property and his honour.” And there are many hadiths which speak of this. So it is not permissible for the lender to make use of the property given as collateral without the permission of the borrower.\nIt says in al-Mughni: We do not know of any difference of scholarly opinion regarding this.\nBut if the borrower gave the lender permission to make use of the property given as collateral, if what is owed is a loan, then it is not permissible for the lender to make use of the property given as collateral, even if the borrower gave permission for that, because this comes under the heading of riba, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Every loan that brings a benefit is riba.” Even though there is some discussion about the soundness of this hadith, the scholars are unanimously agreed about that, that it is not permissible for the lender to make use of and benefit from the borrower’s property because of the loan. So this comes under the heading of riba, and it is not permissible to write that down or to witness it, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) cursed\xa0 the one who consumes riba, the one who pays it, the two who witness it and the one who writes it down.” And this comes under the heading of riba.\nSo if the debt is a loan, and the borrower gives something to the lender as collateral, it is not permissible for the lender to make use of it, whether the borrower gave permission or not, because this is riba.\nBut if the debt was not a loan, such as if it was the price for sold goods, for example, and the like, and he gives him permission to make use of it, then there is nothing wrong with that, because there is no reason to prevent it.

120984,We would like to know what the Salaf (righteous predecessors) believed concerning the Noble Quran.,"['Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“The belief of the Salaf (righteous predecessors) concerning the Quran is like their belief in all the Names and Attributes of Allah, which is a belief that is based on what is indicated by the Book of Allah and the Sunnah (traditions) of His Messenger (peace and blessings be upon him).\xa0\nWe all know that Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, has described the Quran as being His Word and that it was sent down from Him. Allah, may He be Sxalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And if any of the polytheists seeks your protection then grant him protection, so that he may hear the Word of Allah (the Quran), and then escort him to where he can be secure.” [At-Tawbah 9:6]\nUndoubtedly what is meant by the Word of Allah here is the Noble Quran .\nAnd He, may He be exalted, says:\n“Verily, this Quran narrates to the Children of Israel most of that about which they differ.” [An-Naml 27:76]\nSo the Quran is the Word of Allah in both wording and meaning. Allah spoke it in a real sense and gave it to Jibril (peace be upon him) the trustworthy, then Jibril brought it down to the heart of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), so that he might be one of the warners, in a plain Arabic tongue.\xa0\nThe Salaf believe that the Quran was revealed ; Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, revealed it to Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) piecemeal, i.e., bit by bit, over twenty-three years, in accordance with the Wisdom of Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted.\xa0\nMoreover, some of the revelation was revealed for a specific reason for which it was sent down, and some of it was revealed without a specific reason. Moreover, some of it was revealed to tell of something that happened to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his companions. Some of it was revealed concerning Shar`i (legal) rulings, according to what the scholars have said concerning this matter.\xa0\nThen the Salaf say that the Quran is from Allah in the first place and it will return (to Him) at the end of time. This is the view of the Salaf concerning the Noble Quran.\xa0\nIt is clear to us that Allah has described the Noble Quran in superlative terms. He has described it as wise (Hakim), noble (Karim), great (`Adhim), and glorious (Majid).\xa0\nThese qualities, in terms of which Allah has described His Book, may be attainable by one who adheres to this Book and acts upon it both inwardly and outwardly. Allah will give him some share of glory, greatness, wisdom, honour and authority that is not given to the one who does not adhere to the Book of Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted.\xa0\nHence I call all Muslims, rulers and ruled, scholars and ordinary folk, to adhere to the Book of Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, both inwardly and outwardly, so that they may attain honour, happiness and glory, and prevail in the east and in the west.” (Fatawa Kibar `Ulama Al-Ummah)\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/120984/belief-of-the-salaf-concerning-the-quran
