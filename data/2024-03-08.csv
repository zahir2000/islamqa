333551,"I am a young man from an Arab country. I was working in a shop selling children’s nappies (diapers), and my agreement with the owner of the shop was that I would work as a salesman in return for an-agreed upon wage, and he would register me with Social Security, but he kept procrastinating, so that he would not have to pay fees for Social Security. Please note, that the state requires everyone who has a business registration and has workers to register them with the Social Security fund. After I had worked with him for a year, he dismissed me without notice, and with no legitimate, sound reason. I made a complaint against him with the Labour Inspectorate, and my complaint may be summed up as follows: a demand to be registered with the Social Security fund, a demand for compensation for unfair dismissal, a demand for compensation for annual leave, and other demands that are connected to these basic demands. My question is: am I entitled to make these demands? Is it permissible for me to demand to be registered with Social Security, or should I give up my complaint and delegate my affairs to Allah, may He be glorified and exalted?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIf the work contract mentions a specific period of employment, the boss does not have the right to dismiss the employee before that, because hiring is a binding contract that cannot be terminated except with the consent of both parties, and the employee is entitled to his wages until the end of the contract, so long as he was present and made himself available to work.\nIt says in Kashshaf al-Qina‘ (4/33): The hired worker is entitled to wages for merely making himself available, whether he works or not, because he has done what is required of him. End quote.\nSimilarly, if the contract stipulates that the boss has to notify the worker if his services are no longer needed, or that the contract will not be renewed, within a certain timeframe, then the boss has no right to dismiss him if he has not informed him (given him notice), and the contract is renewed automatically in that case.\nThe basic principle regarding that is the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{\xa0O you who have believed, fulfill [all] contracts}\xa0[al-Ma’idah 5:1];\nand the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “The Muslims are bound by their conditions.” Narrated by Abu Dawud (3594); classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud.\nIf the boss was heedless of what we have mentioned above, then you have the right to make a complaint about him.\nSecondly:\nIf the employee is dismissed before the end of the contract period, then he has the right to demand compensation for that period.\nIf he was entitled to paid annual leave, but was dismissed before he was able to take that leave, then he has the right to demand payment for that period. The same applies if he is forced to work during the leave period.\nThirdly:\nThere is nothing wrong with the employee registering in a retirement program or Social Security fund belonging to the state, as has been explained previously, in the answer to question no. 103080.\nThat is so long as the state requires the boss to register his employees with Social Security; if he does not do that, then you have the right to make a complaint to the relevant government department.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/333551/what-is-the-ruling-on-seeking-compensation-for-unfair-dismissal
148129,Is it permissible for a woman to wipe over her head cover?,"[""Praise be to Allah.The scholars differed concerning the ruling on a woman wiping over her head cover ; there are three views:\xa0\n\nThe majority – which was also narrated from Ahmad – are of the view that it is not permissible for her to wipe over it only, and they ruled that if she does that, her Wudu is invalid, unless the head cover is thin and the water can penetrate it.\xa0\n\nIn Al-Mudawwanah (1/124) it says:\xa0\n“Malik said concerning a woman wiping over her head cover : She has to repeat her Wudu and her prayer.”\nWe should point out here that Ash-Shafi`i (may Allah have mercy on him) said that the permissibility of wiping over the head cover depends on whether the report that mentions it is authentic. There are some authentic reports concerning that, such as the Hadith of Bilal (may Allah be pleased with him) in Muslim (275), according to which the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) wiped over his Khuffayn (leather slippers) and head cover. So Ash-Shafi`i (may Allah have mercy on him) should be included among those who allow wiping over the head covers of both men and women.\xa0\n\nThe Hanbalis, according to the other report from their Imam, are of the view that it is permissible to wipe (over the head cover) and the Wudu is valid. This is also the view of Ibn Hazm (may Allah have mercy on him), who said:\xa0\n\n“Anything that is worn on the head, such as a head cover, cap, helmet and chain-mail, and so on, it is permissible to wipe over it, and women and men are the same in that regard, whether there is a reason to do so or not.” (Al-Muhalla, 1/303)\xa0\n\nA third group is of the view that a distinction should be made between that which is difficult to remove and that which is easy. In the first case they regard it as permissible to wipe over it, but not in the second case. This is the view of Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) and, among contemporary scholars, Shaykh Al-`Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him).\xa0\n\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“With regard to a woman wiping over her head cover , there are two reports:\xa0\n\nAccording to the first report it is not permissible, because the texts that speak of the concession only refer to men for sure, whereas there is some doubt as to whether they refer to women.\xa0\nAccording to the second report, it is permissible, and this is the apparent meaning of the general words “Wipe over the Khuffayn and the head cover.” – Narrated by Ahmad (39/325). The commentators said: The Hadith that says that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did that is authentic, but the Hadith that says he allowed it is inauthentic, and women are also included in that, along with men, just as they are included with regard to wiping over the Khuffayn…\xa0\n\nAnd because it is permissible for men to wipe over the head cover, so that is permissible for women too, like men. And because it is clothing that it is permissible to wear on the head and it is usually difficult to take it off, so it is likened to a man’s head cover, and more so, because the woman’s head cover covers more than the man’s head cover, and it is more difficult to take it off, so the woman's need for (this concession) is greater than in the case of the Khuffayn.” (Sharh Al-`Umdah, 1/265, 266)\xa0\nShaykh Al-`Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Whatever the case, if there is some difficulty, either because it is cold or because it is difficult to take it off and put it on again, then there is nothing wrong with being lenient in matters such as this, otherwise it is better not to wipe over it, as there is no authentic text concerning this matter.” (Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti` `Ala Zad Al-Mustaqni`, 1/239)\nThe third view is the one that is most likely to be correct. It is proven from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that he wiped over his head cover, and there is no difference between the head cover of a man and that of a woman; in fact it is more appropriate that this should be permissible in the case of women, because of the reasons mentioned by Shaykh Al-Islam.\xa0\nBased on that, not every head covering may be wiped over; rather if the head is covered with something that might be problematic to take off, as in the case of a woman who fears that her hair may be seen, or she has covered her head to which she has applied henna, or it is very cold and she fears some harm (if she takes off her head cover), and other similar excuses.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/148129/can-i-wipe-over-my-head-cover-during-wudu
93027,What are the things that make Ghusl obligatory?,"['Praise be to Allah.“The things that make Ghusl obligatory are six things. If one of them happens then the Muslim has to do Ghusl .\xa0\n\nEmission of Maniy (semen) from its exit in the male or female, which happens either when one is awake or when one is asleep. If it is emitted when one is awake, there is the condition that one feels pleasure when it is emitted. If it is emitted without pleasure, then Ghusl is not required, such as if it is emitted as the result of sickness. If it is emitted when one is asleep, this is what is called Ihtilam (erotic dream) and Ghusl is required in all cases because he was not aware (of whether there were feelings of pleasure or not) and he may not experience feelings of pleasure. If a sleeper wakes up and finds traces of Maniy, then he must do Ghusl. If he has an erotic dream\xa0but no Maniy comes out of him, and he does not find any trace of it, then he does not have to do Ghusl .\xa0\nPenetration of the penis into the vagina, even if no ejaculation takes place, because of the Hadith narrated by Muslim and others from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “When a man sits between the four parts (arms and legs of his wife) and has intercourse with her, then Ghusl is obligatory.” So Ghusl is required of both parties involved by mere virtue of penetration having taken place, even if no ejaculation takes place, because of this Hadith and because there is scholarly consensus on this point.\xa0\nAccording to some scholars, Ghusl is required when a non-Muslim becomes Muslim, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told some of those who became Muslim to do Ghusl. Many scholars think that it is recommended, not obligatory, for a non-Muslim who becomes Muslim to do Ghusl because it is not narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told everyone who became Muslim to do that. So it may be understood that it is recommended, so as to reconcile the evidence.\xa0\nDeath – the deceased person must be washed, except for the martyr who falls in battle, who is not to be washed.\xa0\nand 6 – Menses and postpartum bleeding, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When your menses ends , then do Ghusl and pray.” And Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And when they have purified themselves” [Al-Baqarah 2:222], referring to menses – they should purify themselves by doing Ghusl after their menses ends .” (Al-Mulakhkhas Al-Fiqhi by Shaykh Salih Al-Fawzan (may Allah preserve him)\xa0\n\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/93027/what-makes-ghusl-obligatory
133585,"If the imam gets up after completing the prayer and before saying the salaam to do an extra rak‘ah, and those who are praying behind him realise that and alert him by saying “Subhan Allah,” yet despite that he insists on getting up for the extra rak‘ah, what is the ruling on that? What should those who are praying behind him do after he gets up?","['Praise be to Allah.What is required of the congregation is to alert the imam. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever notices something amiss during the prayer, let the men say ‘Subhan Allah’ and let the women clap.” And what is required of the imam, if they alert him, is to go back, unless he believes that he is right and they are wrong. In that case, he should do what he himself believes is right and continue until he completes the prayer, according to what he believes is the case. If those who alerted him are certain that he is wrong and is making a mistake, they should not get up with him; rather they should remain seated, reciting at-tahiyyat, sending blessings on the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and offering supplication, waiting for him until they say the salaam with him. That is because he is excused and they are excused; they are excused because they believed that he was making a mistake, and he is excused because he believed that he was right and they were mistaken. Hence each of them is excused because of his ijtihad and being certain, as each of them thinks he was right. Then when the imam says the salaam, they should say the salaam with him.\nBut if the imam is not certain, then what he must do is go back, if two or more people alerted him. In that case, if he is not certain and only thought that he was right, he should go back. He should go back as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did on the day when Dhu’l-Yadayn alerted him [to a mistake in the prayer]. He asked the people, and they said that Dhu’l-Yadayn was right, so the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) went back and completed the prayer. He did not act immediately on what Dhu’l-Yadayn said, because he was one person, and it is not obligatory to accept the view of one person in this regard, unless the imam believes that he is right, in which case he should go back. But if two people alert him, then he should accept what they say and act on it, and ignore what he thinks is the case; that is obligatory. As for the people praying behind the imam, they should not follow him if he makes a mistake by adding or omitting something. If he is adding a rak‘ah, they should sit and wait until he says the salaam, then say the salaam with him. If he has omitted a rak‘ah and did not pay attention to them, and he sits in the third rak‘ah of Zuhr, for example, or of ‘Isha’ or ‘Asr, or he sits in the first rak‘ah of Fajr or Jumu‘ah, and does not pay any heed to them, then they should stand up and complete their prayer, and differ from him, because they believe that he is making a mistake.

326674,"We are a family of nine children; all of us are married and have families. Our father is deceased, and we have an elderly mother. We take turns in looking after her, and one of her children serves or helps her every day. One of our sisters has excused herself from taking care of our mother on the grounds that this is the responsibility of the sons, not of the daughters, because the woman’s duties towards her husband and children take precedence over her duties towards her parents, as stated in Islamic teachings, and a scholar has given her a Fatwa to that effect, as she claims.","[""Praise be to Allah.If the parents need to be looked after, it is obligatory for all their children, whether male or female, to help them, either by doing this themselves or by hiring someone to do it.\nAs-Safarini (may Allah have mercy on him) said in\xa0Ghidha’ Al-Albab\xa0(1/390): “Parents’ rights also include: serving or helping them if both of them, or one of them, needs that.”\nIn\xa0Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah\xa0(19/39) it says:\xa0\n“With regard to the child serving or helping his or her parent, or the parent asking his or her child to help him or her, that is permissible and there is no difference of scholarly opinion concerning that. In fact, this comes under the heading of honouring one's parents that is enjoined in Islamic teachings, and it is obligatory for the child to take care of his or her parent, or to hire someone to do that, when needed. Hence it is not permissible for the child to charge a fee for doing that, because it is duty that is required of him or her, and in the case of one who does a duty that is required of him or her towards someone else, it is not permissible to charge a fee for this.”\xa0\nTherefore, this service and help is obligatory for all of you, but if a woman's husband prevents her from serving and helping her mother , then the husband's right takes precedence , and she can make up for that by hiring a servant or by contributing to wages for a servant, if she has money. But if her husband does not prevent her from doing that, then serving and helping her mother is obligatory for her as it is for her siblings.\nIt is not appropriate for the husband, if he is a man of decency and dignity, to prevent his wife from doing that , especially if she is only going to help her mother one or two days a week.\nMoreover, if the mother needs a woman to take care of her, then the most appropriate people to do that are her daughters, because it is more appropriate for them to undertake that than anyone else, especially if it is not possible to hire a woman to do that, or if the mother does not like strangers (nonfamily members) to see any of her private affairs.\nSo you should advise your sister and explain to her the importance of honouring her mother, and the seriousness of defiant disobedience to her mother, and tell her that it is more appropriate for the daughter to take care of her mother than the son, because taking care of an elderly person may require seeing the `Awrah, and for a woman's daughter to see her `Awrah is less serious than her son seeing it.\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/326674/whose-responsibility-is-it-to-look-after-parents-in-islam
