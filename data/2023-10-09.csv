112124,"I have got engaged to a young man who I think is good. Do you advise me to buy a wedding dress that is a little expensive, or should I try to save the cost of this dress so that this will not be regarded as extravagant? Please note that he is well off and can afford to buy the dress.","['Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with buying a dress for the woman to wear for her wedding, even if it is expensive, so long as it does not reach the level of being extravagant. This varies from one environment and one person to another, but if this dress is only going to be worn once or a few times, as is the case with many women, then it is better not to buy it and to do without it by renting or borrowing a dress, and saving the money that would be paid for it. That is better and more useful.\nIf the woman wants to buy this dress, then she should choose something that she can wear for her wedding and on other occasions, so as to save money, hers and her husband’s. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade wasting money, and Allah, may He be exalted, condemns spendthrifts and states that they are the brothers of the devils.\nThere are some righteous women who are very well off; one of them may buy a dress for her own wedding, then make it a waqf for the benefit of her sisters, so that they can wear it for their weddings. This is a good idea.\nFor more information, please see the answer to question number 12853 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/112124/buying-an-expensive-wedding-dress
21878,"I know that it is only permissible for a Muslim to be mad at a fellow brother for 3 days at most, and the one who is better is he who talks first. However, if I only see a certain brother once a week or so, is it permissible for me to turn away 3 times that I see him، or do I have to stick with the 3 day limit. If I do,  then he will never know my displeasure with him. I know this isn't a good attitude to have, but sometimes a brother may do something and I would like to let him know that I do not approve of it.","['Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to forsake a Muslim, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “It is not permissible for a man to forsake his Muslim brother for more than three days, each of them turning away from the other when they meet. The better of them is the one who gives the greeting of Salam first.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 5727; Muslim, 2560)\nIf the believer is a relative, such as a brother, nephew, uncle or cousin, then forsaking is an even worse sin.\xa0\nThis applies unless the person is committing a sin and there is an interest to be served by forsaking him, i.e., it will make him give up the sin. In that case, there is nothing wrong with it because this comes under the heading of removing evil. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever among you sees an evil action, let him change it with his hand [by taking action]; if he cannot, then with his tongue [by speaking out]; if he cannot then with his heart [by hating it and feeling that it is wrong], and that is the weakest level of faith.”\xa0(Narrated by Muslim, 49) \xa0\nThe basic principle is that it is prohibited for a Muslim to forsake his fellow-Muslim unless there is a reason to allow it.\xa0(See Fatawa Manar Al-Islam, by Ibn ‘Uthaymin, vol. 3, p. 732)\xa0\nWali Al-Din Al-‘Iraqi said:\xa0\n“This prohibition applies in cases where the forsaking is caused by anger with regard to something permissible and has nothing to do with religion. With regard to forsaking someone for a religious reason, such as his committing sin or Bid`ah; this is not prohibited. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded (his companions) to forsake Ka`b ibn Malik, Hilal ibn Umayyah and Mararah ibn Al-Rabi’ (may Allah be pleased with them). Ibn ‘Abd Al-Barr said: This Hadith of Ka`b indicates that it is permissible for a man to forsake his Muslim brother if he commits some act of Bid’ah or immorality, in the hope that forsaking him may discipline him and serve as a rebuke to him. Abu Al-‘Abbas Al-Qurtubi said: With regard to forsaking a person because of sin or Bid`ah, it should be continued until he repents from that and does not go back to it. Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr also said: The scholars are unanimously agreed that it is impermissible for a Muslim to forsake his fellow-Muslim for more than three days, unless there is the fear that speaking to him and keeping in touch with him will affect one’s religious commitment or have some harmful effect on one\'s spiritual and worldly interests. If that is the case, it is permissible to avoid him, because peaceful avoidance is better than harmful mixing."" (Tarh Al-Tathrib, 8/99)\nWhat you should do, if your brother has done something prohibited, is to advise him and explain that this thing is prohibited, and remind him of Allah. If you see that he is persisting in his sin and you think that forsaking him will serve a purpose, then it is permissible to do so, as stated above. But if he has simply done something that you do not agree with, or it is the matter of different points of view, then you should explain to him that you do not agree with what he has done, or with his mistaken point of view. But if you make forsaking him the sign of your disagreeing with him, this may lead to him rejecting your view completely, let alone the fact that this is not a legitimate Islamic justification for forsaking him for more than three days. We have seen above in the Fatwa of Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin that the basic principle is that it is prohibited for a Muslim to forsake his fellow-Muslim, unless there is a reason to allow it.\xa0\nThe Muslim must be forbearing and sincere towards his brothers, he must be tolerant towards them and overlook their mistakes. He should not hasten to adopt a solution that may cause division and prohibited kinds of forsaking. May Allah help us all to do that which He loves and which pleases Him.\xa0\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 13731 , 11018 , 126918 , 93775 , and 93146 .']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21878/forsaking-your-muslim-brother-because-of-differences-in-opinion
256475,"Sometimes only one doctor is on call, and he goes to offer his prayer, and whilst he is praying he is notified of an emergency case. Should he interrupt his prayer so that the patient will not be harmed because of his delay, or what should he do?","['Praise be to Allah.If the doctor has started to pray, then he is told of an emergency case and there is no one available to take care of it except him, then what he must do is interrupt his prayer and treat the patient, because the prayer may be repeated later, or even made up after its time has ended, whereas if the life of the patient is lost because of the doctor’s delay, he cannot be brought back.\nThe same applies if the patient suffers physical harm because of such a delay.\nOne of the well-established principles according to the scholars is that that which could be lost is to be given precedence over that which cannot be lost.\nIt says in Kashshaf al-Qina‘ (1/380): We should protect a disbeliever whose life is to be protected because he is living under Muslim rule, or there is a truce or treaty with his people, from falling into a well and the like, such as a snake that is heading towards him, just as we should protect a Muslim from that, because both lives are to be protected according to Islamic teachings.\nAnd we should save a drowning person and the like, such as one who is caught in a fire, so prayer should be interrupted for that purpose, whether the prayer is obligatory or supererogatory.\nWhat appears to be the case is that this applies even if there is not much time left for the prayer, because the individual can make up the prayer after the time for it has ended, unlike saving the one who is drowning and the like. End quote.\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Interrupting the prayer for an important reason, or to ward off danger, such as saving one who is caught in a fire or is drowning, or warding off a human or animal who wants to kill him, and the like – there is nothing wrong with any of that.""(Fatawa Nur ‘ala ad-Darb by Ibn Baz 9/303).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: He may interrupt his prayer to save one whose life is to be protected [according to Islamic teachings], because saving one whose life is to be protected is obligatory, and doing that will be missed if he continues praying. As for prayer, continuing it is obligatory, but he can make it up after saving that person whose life is to be protected.""(Fatawa Nur ‘ala ad-Darb by Ibn ‘Uthaymin).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/256475/can-the-on-call-doctor-interrupt-his-prayer-if-an-emergency-case-is-brought-to-the-hospital
