266793,"We had 1 talaq. After 6 months my husband said if you go you are divorced. I left. We were bit careless but also I didn't know much of conditional talaq and it was our 2nd incident of talaq so I was't worrried. I thought if it's a talaq still it'll be only 2nd. It often bothered me but I couldn't ask him. After few years we had 1 more talaq then I asked him about the conditional divorce. First he didn't remember it since the incident was few years old. Then he said that he said free. I told my husband that some ulima say word talaq depends on intention in conditional talaq. Then he said; I said free and I don't remember if I said word talaq but if I said word talaq I didn\'t intend it. He also said why you didn't remind me before 3rd incident. I know his words are taken about his intention because he knows better but does same ruling apply in our situation like, he forgot. I know he said word talaq so to me he forgot and our 3rd incident occured after few years so by the time if he can forget his word then now he can forget his intention too. In your opinion conditional talaq depends on intention but my question is; If I clearly remember that he said word talaq when he said if you go you are divorced and he doesn't remember because he says he said free then should his statement about his intention that he said free but if he said word talaq he didn't intend it, still be acceptable, even he FORGOT his word because he says he said free, while I remember he said word talaq","['Praise be to Allah.If a man says to his wife, “If you go, then you are divorced,” this is a divorce that is dependent on a condition.\nThe majority of scholars are of the view that it counts as a divorce if she goes.\nSome of the scholars are of the view that it depends on the husband’s intention. If he did not intend divorce – rather he intended to prevent her from going – then it comes under the ruling on oaths, and if she goes, he must offer expiation for breaking an oath (kaffarat yamin).\nThis is the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, and it is the basis on which we give answers on our website.\nBased on that, if the husband says that he did not intend divorce when he said that, or he forgot what he said, and he says, “Assuming that I said that, I did not intend divorce,” then it does not count as a divorce; rather he must offer expiation for breaking an oath.\nWhat appears to be the case from your question is that your husband is certain that he did not intend divorce, even if he has forgotten what he actually said.\nBased on that, no divorce has taken place.\nBut if even we assume that the word of divorce was very clear and the divorce took place as soon as he uttered the word of divorce, meaning that it was not dependent on anything, and he used clear words of divorce, then the woman must count this as a divorce, even if the husband forgot what he said, because a clear statement of divorce which took place immediately is not dependent on what the husband intended.\nSee also the answer to question no. 116641 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/266793/he-issued-a-conditional-divorce-and-forgot-what-he-said
268754,What is the ruling on killing large lizards such as monitor lizards? Is there reward for killing them?,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThose lizards or other animals that are proven to be harmful should be killed, so as to ward off their harm.\nBut if it is proven that they are not harmful, then they should not be killed, like all other animals that are harmless.\nThe evidence for that is the proven report that was narrated in as-Sahihayn and elsewhere, according to which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade killing dogs, but he enjoined killing aggressive dogs.\nAnimals that are proven to be harmful come under the same ruling as aggressive dogs, which means that it is prescribed to kill them. Animals that are not harmful come under the same ruling as other dogs, which it is forbidden to kill.\nIbn Muflih said:\nIt says in al-Mughni, regarding the issue of killing dogs: As for those which are not harmful, it is not permissible to kill them. He quoted as evidence the prohibition on killing dogs. The wording indicates that other animals are to be dealt with in the same way. If it were permissible to kill harmless animals other than dogs, then it would be permissible to kill dogs.\nThis is what may be understood from the statements of the scholars, and it is a sound statement.\nBased on that, we may understand that allowing the killing of aggressive dogs in particular means that it is not permissible to kill those that are not harmful.""(Al-Adab ash-Shar‘iyyah\xa03/355).\nSee also the answer to question no. 159518 .\nWhat is known about monitor lizards is that they are not harmful to humans by nature, because they are like lizards (ad-dabb). For that reason, it was narrated from some of the scholars that it is permissible to eat them. See Musannaf ‘Abd ar-Razzaq (4/529).\nBut some of the scholars said that it is haram to eat them, because they are regarded as vermin.\nAd-Dumayri said: Based on this principle, it may be understood that eating large lizards is haram, because they are vermin, and the scholars did not make any exceptions for them.""(Hayat al-Haywaan\xa0 2/542).\nBased on that, so long as monitor lizards are not harmful to humans, they are not to be killed, because killing them is destroying a soul for no reason, and undoubtedly it was not created except for some wise reason intended by Allah, may He be glorified and exalted.\nOne of the most obvious reasons is maintaining environmental balance, so that some animals will not overwhelm others. Monitor lizards are known for killing snakes, so killing lizards and eradicating them from the environment will lead to snakes increasing in number and becoming dominant. Glory be to the Most Wise Creator.\nSee also the answer to question no. 258988 .\nSecondly:\nIf you find some harmful types of large lizards, or some individual lizards whose peaceful nature has changed and they have gone rogue, which is something that happens with many animals, and that results in harm to people, or there is fear of its harm, then such a lizard may be killed. The same applies if [a rogue animal] is attacking someone’s sheep or domesticated animals, and the like. He may ward it off by killing it in order to protect his property, just as any aggressive animal may be killed, even if it is an animal that it is prohibited to kill in principle.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAnimals fall into two categories:\n1.. Those which are harmful and aggressive by nature. It is permissible to kill them, whether they are those which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) mentioned by name – such as scorpions, rats and aggressive dogs – or they are other animals which come under the same ruling for the same reason, namely that they are harmful. Hence the scholars said: It is permissible to kill every harmful animal. Such an animal is to be killed if it is usually harmful and aggressive, even if it has not caused any harm, because it will inevitably cause harm at some other time.\n2.. Animals that do not cause any nuisance or harm. Such an animal is not to be killed, but killing it is not haram, although it is better not to kill it.\nIf it harms you, you may kill it in order to ward off its harm.\nWe only said that it is better not to kill it if it does not harm you, because with regard to what the religious texts say about animals and insects, they fall into three categories:\n1.. Those which we are instructed to kill; 2. Those which we are forbidden to kill; 3. Those concerning which nothing was said about killing them.\nThose which we are instructed to kill include scorpions, rats, aggressive dogs, snakes, geckos and so on.\nThose which we are forbidden to kill include ants, bees and hoopoes.\nThose concerning which nothing was said about killing them include all other animals and insects. Nothing was said concerning them, and it is better not to kill them, because the least that may be said about killing them is that it is destroying a soul for no reason.\nMoreover, some of the scholars said that so long as the creature is still alive, it is glorifying Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, and if it dies, that tasbih (glorification of Allah) will cease, and your killing it means that it will be destroyed and will no longer be glorifying Allah.\nWhatever the case, the ruling is that it is better not to kill it so long as it is not harming you, but if it harms you, then there is nothing wrong with killing it.""(Liqa’at al-Bab al-Maftuh, no. 67).\nIt says in al-Adab ash-Shar‘iyyah by Ibn Muflih (3/355):\nIt says in al-Mustaw‘ib regarding things that are prohibited in ihram: With regard to ants and everything that is neither harmful nor beneficial, such as beetles, scarabs, worms, flies and ants that do not bite or sting, Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If they harm him, he may kill them, but it is disliked (makruh) to kill them if they are not harmful, although if he does that there are no consequences for him.
