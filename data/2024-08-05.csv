391100,"There is a poor man who asks for charity for himself, but he does it in an indirect manner, because he feels embarrassed about that, so he says: I know someone who needs charity. So people give to him, then he keeps it for himself, and by doing that he maintains his dignity in front of people. What is the ruling on that?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nRuling on asking people for money\nThe basic principle is that it is prohibited to ask of people, unless that is in exceptional circumstances.\nAl-Bukhari (1475) and Muslim (1040) narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “A man will keep on begging from people until he comes on the Day of Resurrection with not a bit of flesh on his face.”\nAl-Bukhari (650), Abu Dawud (1626), an-Nasa’i (2592) and Ibn Majah (1840) narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever begs from people when he has enough to suffice him,\xa0 will come on the Day of Resurrection with his begging like scratches or gashes on his face.” It was said: O Messenger of Allah, what is sufficient for him? He said, “Fifty dirhams, or their value in gold.”\nIt is not permissible to ask of people except in very few [?] circumstances, because of the report narrated by Muslim (1044) from Qabisah ibn Mukhariq al-Hilali, who said: I incurred a debt (in order to reconcile between two parties) and I came to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to ask him (for help) with it. He said: “Stay with us until the zakah comes, and we will order that something be given to you.” Then he said: “O Qabisah, asking for help is not permissible except in one of three cases: a man who has incurred a debt (in order to reconcile between two parties), for whom it is permissible to ask for help until he has paid it off, then he should refrain; a man who has been stricken by a blight that has destroyed all his crops and wealth, for whom it is permissible to ask for help until he has enough to get by – or he gets enough to meet his basic needs; and a man who is stricken by poverty and three men of wisdom among his people acknowledge that So and so has been stricken by poverty, then it becomes permissible for him to ask for help until he has enough to get by – or to meet his basic needs. Apart from these cases asking for help, O Qabisah, is haram and the one who collects it is consuming something haram.”\nIt says in Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah (24/375): It is permissible to ask people for money for a needy person who does not have enough to suffice him, and is not able to earn money. He may ask people for enough to meet his need only.\nAs for one who is not in need, or one who is in need but is able to earn money, it is not permissible for him to ask of people, and whatever he takes from people in this case is haram for him, because of the hadith of Qabisah… End quote.\nSo this brother should think about whether it is permissible for him to ask of people or not.\nSecondly:\nOne who is appointed to distribute charity and decides to take some of it for himself if he is poor\nThe jurists differed concerning someone who is appointed to distribute charity or zakah: does he have the right to take some of it for himself if he is poor?\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If he is appointed to give out charity to the needy and he is needy, or he is instructed to distribute one third of it to some people and he is one of them, or he is given money and is instructed to distribute it to whomever he wants or to give it to whomever he wants, then what is narrated from Ahmad is that it is not permissible for him to take any of it. Ahmad said: If he has in his possession money to be given to the poor and spent on charitable causes and he is in need, he should not consume any of it, because he was only instructed to distribute it. That is because the general meaning of the instructions given by the one who appointed him indicates that it should be given to others.""(Al-Mughni\xa0 5/70).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin was asked about a poor man who takes zakah from his rich friend on the grounds that he will distribute it, then he keeps it himself. What is the ruling on doing that?\nHe replied: This is haram for him, because it is betraying the trust. His friend gave it to him on the basis that he would act as his proxy and give it to others, but he is taking it for himself. The scholars stated that it is not permissible for a proxy to give to himself that which he has been appointed to distribute.\nBased on that, what this person must do is explain to his friend that what he used to take before was spent on himself. If he pardons him, all well and good, but if he does not pardon him, then he is liable, meaning that he is liable for what he kept for himself and must give that amount as zakah on behalf of his friend.""(Fatawa Arkan al-Islam\xa0 p. 447).\nThis applies to one who is given money to distribute without asking for that, so how about if he asks for it and pretends that it is for others?\nIf he is given money to distribute without asking for it, it may be that he is included in what the giver said, “Give it to the poor.” But if he asked for it and said: “There is a poor person who is in need of money,” in that case what would come to the giver’s mind is that it was for someone else, so he is not included in what he said to the giver and his taking anything of that money is a betrayal of the trust, as noted above in the words of Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him). Opening this door will result in a great deal of trouble and betrayal, and will lead to carelessness regarding the matter of devouring people’s wealth unlawfully.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/391100/ruling-on-one-who-asks-for-charity-for-someone-else-then-keeps-it-for-himself-because-he-is-poor
108955,What is the prescribed punishment for slander?,"['Praise be to Allah.What is slander?\nWhat is meant by slander with regard to the prescribed punishment is an accusation of zina (adultery or fornication) or homosexuality . The one who accuses a person of zina or vilifies him in such terms has slandered him and accused him of something abhorrent.\xa0\nSlander is prohibited , and is indeed a major sin, if the person slandered is chaste and innocent of zina.\xa0\nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Verily, those who accuse chaste women, who never even think of anything touching their chastity and are good believers — are cursed in this life and in the Hereafter, and for them will be a great torment.” [An-Nur 24:23]\xa0\nAs-Sa`di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Allah has issued a stern warning against making accusations against chaste women, as He says: “Verily, those who accuse chaste women”, i.e., those who refrain from immoral actions, “who never even think of anything touching their chastity”, and such things would never cross their minds, “and are good believers — are cursed in this life and in the Hereafter”, and a curse applies only in the case of major sins.\xa0\nThe curse is confirmed because it is ongoing in this world and in the Hereafter. “and for them will be a great torment”. This is in addition to the curse, and shows that they are even further removed from divine mercy, and that His severe punishment will be upon them.”\xa0\nAnd the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Avoid the seven sins that doom a person to Hell.” It was said: What are they, O Messenger of Allah? He said: “Associating others with Allah (shirk); witchcraft; killing a soul whom Allah has forbidden us to kill, except in cases dictated by Islamic law; consuming orphans’ wealth; consuming riba; fleeing from the battlefield; and slandering chaste, innocent women.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari (2767) and Muslim (89)\xa0\nAl-Hafidh Ibn Hajar said: “What is meant by the sins that doom a person to Hell are major sins.”\xa0\nIt says in Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah (22/76):\xa0\n“It is not permissible for a Muslim to slander his brother, and it is a major sin; he must repent from that and seek forgiveness from the one whom he slandered; if the latter does not pardon him, he has the right to demand his rights according to Shari`ah.\xa0\nAnd Allah is the Source of strength. May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.”\xa0\nShaykh `Abd al-`Aziz ibn `Abdullah ibn Baz, Shaykh `Abd Ar-Razzaq `Afifi, Shaykh `Abdullah ibn Ghadyan\xa0\nPunishment for slander in Islam\nThe scholars unanimously agreed that it is obligatory to carry out the prescribed punishment on one who slanders a chaste person, and the punishment is eighty lashes, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And those who accuse chaste women, and produce not four witnesses, flog them with eighty stripes, and reject their testimony forever. They indeed are the Fasiqun (liars, rebellious, disobedient to Allah).” [An-Nur 24:4]\nThe wisdom behind the prescribed punishment for slander\xa0\n\nIt prevents accusations of immorality.\nIt protects people’s honour from being transgressed and protects their reputations from being tarnished.\nIt prevents enmity and grudges; wars may break out because of slurs against people’s honour.\nIt prevents such things becoming part of public opinion and protects people from having to hear them\nIt prevents the spread of rumours among the believers, because when there are a lot of accusations and such talk becomes common and is easily spoken of, the foolish become bold enough to commit such actions.\n\nSo it is wise to prescribe the prescribed punishment for slander so that people will refrain from accusing one another of immoral actions. (See: Al-Mughni (12/383); Al-Muhalla (11/268, 269); Al-Majmu` (22/94, 98); Hashiyat Ibn Qasim (7/330); Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti` (14/278)\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 21576 , 381937 , and 199049 .\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/108955/punishment-for-slander-in-islam
198536,"I have four children, the oldest of whom is nine years old. Usually I used to buy them Ribena and Lucozade, and sweets, until one of my friends told me that Lucozade contains 0.01% alcohol and Ribena goes through a filter that is made of porcine gelatin. I researched on the Internet and I found that according to the Sharia Council in the UK it is halal. That was in 2004.","['Praise be to Allah.In our response, we would like to note the following:\n1. It is not permissible for the Muslim at all to add any alcohol or pork products, or other prohibited substances, to any of his food or drink, even if it is a small amount, because he is enjoined to avoid all of that.\n2. If the Muslim finds any kind of food or drink being sold in the market, and he is not certain about it, or he does not think it is very likely that some haram substance has been added to it, then the basic principle is that food or drink is permissible, and mere doubt or suspicion on its own does not affect anything.\n3. If he finds out that some alcohol or pork product, or any other haram substance, has been added to the food or drink, then if it is a small amount that is absorbed into the other substances, and no trace of it remains in the food or drink, meaning that no colour, taste or smell of it can be discerned, then this does not affect anything either, and it is not prohibited to consume those foods or drinks. This is the case with regard to the small amount mentioned in the question. Such small amounts are absorbed into what they are added to, and no trace of them remains.\n4. It is haram to consume any of these foods or drinks if a large amount of haram substances that leaves a trace has been added to them, or a small amount has been added, but it leaves a trace and is not absorbed; rather some of its characteristics remain, such as its colour, taste, smell or any other trace, such as an intoxicating effect in the case of alcohol and other intoxicating substances.\n5. With regard to intoxicating substances, it is not stipulated that the amount of this food that is normally consumed should not cause intoxication. It is well known that sweets and chocolates cannot contain enough alcohol to cause intoxication directly from the amount that people usually consume. Rather the Islamic principle regarding this matter is that what causes intoxication in large amounts, a small amount of it is haram.\n6. There is a general principle and Islamic etiquette that is prescribed for the believer, which says that whatever you feel uncomfortable about, and whatever causes you to feel doubt and un-ease, you should leave it, and take from the good (halal) options that do not cause you to feel that way, because the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Leave that which makes you doubt for that which does not make you doubt, for what is true brings reassurance and what is false brings doubt.” Narrated by at-Tirmidhi (2442) and others; classed as sahih by al-Albani. And the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “That which is halal is clear and that which is haram is clear, and between them are doubtful matters which many people do not understand. Whoever guards against the doubtful matters will protect his religious commitment from shortcomings and will protect his honour from slander, but whoever falls into that which is doubtful will fall into that which is haram, like a shepherd who grazes his flock around reserved land; he will soon graze in it. Verily, every king has his reserved land and verily, the reserved land of Allah is that which He has forbidden.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (1910) and Muslim (2996).\nSee also the answer to question no. 114129 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/198536/ruling-on-sweets-which-contain-a-very-small-amount-of-alcohol
242838,"Is the wife entitled to a monthly allowance that is just for her, especially if she has no source of income except what her husband gives her?","['Praise be to Allah.Obligation to spend on wife\xa0\nWhat the husband must do is spend on his wife on a reasonable basis, which includes the costs of accommodation, food, drink and clothing, according to scholarly consensus, and includes medical treatment and medicine according to the more correct opinion.\n\nWith regard to accommodation, that is because Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n“Lodge them (the divorced women) where you dwell, according to your means, and do not treat them in such a harmful way that they are obliged to leave.” [At-Talaq 65:6]\nIf this refers to one who is divorced, then it is more applicable to one who is not divorced.\n\nWith regard to food, drink and clothing, that is because Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n“but the father of the child shall bear the cost of the mother’s food and clothing on a reasonable basis.” [Al-Baqarah 2:233]\nAnd the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Their rights over you are that you should provide for them and clothe them on a reasonable basis.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1218)\nIt was narrated that Mu`awiyah Al-Qushayri said: I said: O Messenger of Allah, what are the rights of the wife of one of us over him?

So if he is well off, he should not refuse to give her this allowance, especially if she does not have any other source of income.\nAl-Bukhari (55) and Muslim (1002) narrated from Abu Mas`ud Al-Badri (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If a man spends on his family, seeking reward for that with Allah, then it will be counted as an act of charity on his part.”\nAnd Muslim (994) and others narrated from Thawban, the freed slave of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), [that he said]: “The best dinar that a man spends is a dinar that he spends on his dependents, and a dinar that a man spends on his mount (for Jihad) for the sake of Allah, and a dinar that he spends on his companions (in Jihad) for the sake of Allah.”\nAbu Qilabah said: He began by mentioning his dependents. Then Abu Qilabah said: What man earns a greater reward than a man who spends on his young dependents, whom Allah keeps from needing people or benefits or makes independent of means through him?\nAl-Bukhari (1295) and Muslim (1628) narrated from Sa`d ibn Abu Waqqas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to him: “You will never spend anything, seeking thereby the pleasure of Allah, but you will be rewarded for it, even a morsel that you put in your wife’s mouth.”\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/242838/how-much-money-should-i-give-my-wife-each-month
