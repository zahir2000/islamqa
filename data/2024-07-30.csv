406458,"If I move to make my life in Japan, will i get the sins of my children & descendance if they divert to islam?","['Praise be to Allah.Living in the land of the disbelievers is fraught with risks, because there is such a great deal of temptation, and the danger for children and grandchildren is greater. They may be compelled to commit objectionable actions in the schools and elsewhere, and the father may not have any control over his son or daughter, so he will not be able to deter them from unlawful relationships or unlawful actions. Thus the child will grow up committing sin, and that may lead to him giving up Islam altogether. The reality in those countries bears witness to that.\nParents are responsible for raising their children and protecting them from the causes that lead to deviation.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{O you who believe, guard yourselves and your families against a fire …}\xa0[at-Tahrim 66:6].\nMujahid and others among the early generations said: Advise your families to fear Allah and discipline them. Qatadah said: Instruct them to obey Allah and forbid them to disobey Him.\nAl-Bukhari (2554) and Muslim (1829) narrated from ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Each of you is in a position of responsibility and each of you is answerable for those under his care. The ruler of the people is in a position of responsibility and is answerable for those under his care. A man is in a position of responsibility over his household and is answerable for those under his care. A woman is in a position of responsibility over her husband’s house and children and is answerable for those under her care. The slave is in a position of responsibility over his master’s wealth and is answerable for it. Indeed, each of you is in a position of responsibility and each of you is answerable for those under his care.”\nCountries vary in the extent of evil that is present in them and the possibility of the children being corrupted or not. The ages of the children also make a difference; protecting younger children is easier than protecting adolescents and older children.\nWhat may be said about parents’ being responsible for their children going astray is that if the parents take measures to keep their children on the right path and avoid things that may lead to their being corrupted, then they will not be questioned about anything else.\nApplying that to the matter under discussion here means that it is not permissible for the parents to move with their children from a Muslim country, where it is most likely that they will be safe from temptation that could lead them away from their religion, especially the major temptations to which those who live in non-Muslim countries are exposed. It is not permissible for the parents to move with their children when they have an alternative to that, even if the standard of living is better and opportunities for higher earnings are available, and other worldly considerations.\nBut if they or their country is faced with some emergency which forces them to move to a non-Muslim country, and they can find no other alternative, then what the parents must do is choose a country in which there is a large number of Muslims and where they are able to practice Islam openly.\nOne of the guidelines on choosing a country in which to live is that there should be schools that are only for Muslims, where their children can study and be safe from seeing nakedness and other evils, and from having to study subjects that promote ideas of disbelief.\nThey should try to teach their children Arabic and Islam, to memorize the Holy Qur’an and attend Jumu‘ah and prayers in congregation.\nIf there is a city like that, there is nothing wrong with the parents moving there, then if the child goes astray after that, there will be no sin on them; that would be comparable to a case in which a child drifts away from Islam when living in a Muslim country.\nBut if there are few Muslims in the country, and perhaps there are no mosques or it is not possible to go to the mosque except on Friday, and there are no Islamic schools, so the children have to study with the local people and learn their customs and see their evils, and study their curricula, then this is an environment which will lead to their going astray. In fact, the basic assumption is that children will go astray. Hence the one who takes his children to such a country is harming them, and is the cause of their becoming corrupted and doomed, and he is responsible for their going astray, let alone their disbelieving and apostatising – Allah forbid.\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no person whom Allah puts in charge of others and he fails to be sincere towards them, but he will not smell the fragrance of Paradise.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (7150_ and Muslim (1442).\nAnd he said: “Allah will question each person in a position of responsibility about what he was responsible for – whether he took care of it or neglected it – until He questions a man about the members of his household.” Narrated by Ibn Hibban; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Ghayat al-Muram, no. 271.\nSo when the father is asked tomorrow about travelling to that land even though he thought it was likely that his children would be corrupted, how will he respond?\nWill he say: O Lord, I was seeking wealth or cleanliness or luxury or freedom or a good education?\nWhat are these things worth if the cost is losing one’s faith?\nThus you will realize that the basic principle is that taking your children to non-Muslim countries is something that is restricted and is not allowed except when one has no other choice and one is able to find a city in which there are the things we mentioned above, namely a large Muslim community with many mosques, schools and other organisations.\nIf the Muslim travels to that country because he has no choice, and settling there is permissible according to Islamic teachings, and he does the things mentioned above to the best of his ability to protect his children, but they still go astray, then there is no sin on him.\nBut if he travels there by his own choice, and he has no Islamically acceptable excuse for settling in that land, and one of his children goes astray, then he is responsible for that, because he is the one who took him towards that evil and made it easily accessible to him.\nFor more information, please see the answers to questions no. 52893 and 224475 .\nWe ask Allah to protect us and you, and the Muslims.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/406458/will-he-bear-the-burden-of-his-childrens-and-grandchildrens-sins-if-they-go-astray-from-islam-in-a-non-muslim-country
438124,"I live in France, and my son has become gay, unfortunately. I have two questions, which I hope you will answer and for which I thank you in advance. Am I responsible before Allah for what he does? I have cut off all ties with him; is this permissible, or is it regarded as coming under the heading of severing ties of kinship?","['Praise be to Allah.We have read your message, and we understand your suffering and share your grief. We ask Almighty Allah to grant your son well-being and to guide him back to the straight path and make him one of His righteous slaves, and to make the day come when you will have the joy of seeing him return to the right path.\nYour question refers to two issues:\nThe first issue has to do with whether you are responsible before Allah for your son’s deviation.\nIt is no secret that Allah has put parents in charge of raising their children, and He has commanded them to do that. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{O you who believe, guard yourselves and your families against a fire whose fuel is men and stones, over which are [appointed] angels harsh and stern, who do not disobey Allah in whatever He commands them, and they do whatever they are commanded to do}\xa0[at-Tahrim 66:6].\nAnd the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Each of you is in a position of responsibility and each of you is answerable for those under his care. The ruler of the people is in a position of responsibility and is answerable for those under his care. A man is in a position of responsibility over his household and is answerable for those under his care. A woman is in a position of responsibility over her husband’s house and children and is answerable for those under her care. The servant is in a position of responsibility over his master’s wealth and is answerable for it.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (853).\nWe cannot evaluate the extent to which you fulfilled this responsibility in a country where you are confronted with forces that have a deep impact on children in schools, the media and elsewhere. The responsibility is greater for one who chose to live in a non-Muslim country with his children, as Muslim families pay a high moral price for this choice.\nHence the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) emphatically forbade the Muslim to settle in the lands of non-Muslims. He only did that because of the great evils that result from settling in such lands, from which no one except Allah can save him.\nIf there was any shortcoming or neglect, then you must repent and seek Allah’s forgiveness.\nWhatever the case, what must be done is to seek a solution to the current problem, deal with what has happened, and strive to prevent what has not happened, lest this happen again – Allah forbid – with his younger siblings.\nPlease see the answer to question no. 52893 .\nThe second part of your question has to do with your cutting off ties with your son.\nYou did not state your son’s age in the question, or when the signs of deviant behaviour began to appear in him. Whatever the case, before cutting off ties with him, there are steps and effectives measures that could be taken to bring him back to the straight path and rid him of this deviation, especially if he is below the age of twenty. In that case, cutting off ties with him may make him go even further astray, because you are living in a society which embraces such cases and makes them deviate further. What we advise you to do is the following:\n1. Do not cut off ties with him or kick him out of the house. His remaining with you will give you more chances to try to set him straight by direct and indirect means.\nYou can take him with you to Islamic centres or places which you think will help to expedite his repentance and rid him of this problem.\nSo long as a person’s soul is still in his body, there should be no despair.\nLut continued to communicate with his people until the last moment, despite their persisting in committing evil actions, individually and in groups.\nOne of the greatest remedies for one who is tested with this calamity is to remind him of Allah and warn him of His punishment, and remind him of what happened to the people of Lut and the divine wrath that befell them. If he fears Allah and hopes for that which is with Him, that will enable him to start resisting this urge and will prompt him to deal with it, and give up his whims and desires, and even his sickness and deviance.\n2. You should be close to him and take him with you whenever you can. You should organize some Islamic activities with him and the rest of the family, such as reading Qur’an or some of the Prophet’s biography (Sirah). Perhaps you could take him on a trip for ‘umrah, and that may be a step along the way to change him.\n3. You should try to move from the neighbourhood where you are living, to a neighbourhood in which there are more opportunities to help expedite his recovery and rid him of this deviance, even if that causes you some trouble or means returning to your Muslim homeland.\n4. Remember that the door of hope is always open, so stay close to it and try to influence him indirectly by showing him some examples of heroic and manly behaviour, such as documentaries and moving clips which convey messages of dignity and heroism. All of these are messages that will go to the subconscious and address part of the problem, in sha Allah, and help in bringing him back to the right path.\n5.. Keeping busy with some work that will occupy his time and benefit him physically and financially, such as strenuous physical exercises, or part-time work that does not leave him with free time, but will benefit him financially.\nHowever, before all of that, strive hard in constantly calling upon Allah and asking Him to grant him well-being and bring him back to the truth and the straight path, and to grant him wisdom and enable him to repent sincerely.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/438124/advice-for-dealing-with-a-gay-son
224152,"What is the evidence from the Quran and Sunnah for reciting quietly in Dhuhr and `Asr, when the recitation in Fajr, Maghrib and `Isha’ is done out loud?","['Praise be to Allah.Which prayers are prayed loudly?\nWe thank you for this concern and appreciate your interest in finding out the evidence from the Quran and Sunnah at such a young age, and we ask Allah to make you of benefit to others.\nAllah, may He be glorified and exalted, has commanded us to follow the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and emulate him, as He, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“There has certainly been for you in the Messenger of Allah an excellent pattern for anyone whose hope is in Allah and the Last Day and [who] remembers Allah often.” [Al-Ahzab 33:21]\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Pray as you have seen me praying .” The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to recite out loud in Fajr prayer and the first two Rak`ahs of Maghrib and `Isha’, and he would recite quietly in all other cases.\xa0\nEvidence for reciting out loud and quietly in the five daily prayers\nTexts which refer to reciting out loud include the following:\n\nThe report narrated by Al-Bukhari (735) and Muslim (463) from Jubayr ibn Mut`im (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) reciting [Surat] At-Tur in Maghrib.\nThe report narrated by Al-Bukhari (733) and Muslim (464) from Al-Bara` (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: I heard the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) reciting “Wat-tini waz-zaytun” [i.e., Surat At-Tin] in `Isha’ prayer, and I never heard anyone with a more beautiful voice than him.\xa0\nThe report narrated by Al-Bukhari (739) and Muslim (449) from Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) about the jinn coming and listening to the Quran from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), in which it says that he was leading his companions in Fajr prayer, and when they heard the Quran they listened attentively to it.\n\nThese Hadiths indicate that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to recite out loud in such a way that those who were present could hear it.\nEvidence that the recitation is to be done quietly in Dhuhr and `Asr prayers includes the following:\n\nThe report narrated by Al-Bukhari (713) from Khabbab (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which someone asked him: Did the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) recite Quran in Dhuhr and `Asr? He said: Yes. We said: How did you know that? He said: From the movement of his beard [as he recited quietly].\n\nThus it becomes clear that reciting out loud in the prayers where that is to be done and reciting quietly in the prayers where that is to be done is the Sunnah of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and the Muslims unanimously agreed on these rulings.\nAl-Bukhari (738) and Muslim (396) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: In every prayer you should recite. What the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) made us hear we make you hear, and what he recited quietly we recite quietly.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“The Sunnah is to recite out loud in the (first) two Rak`ahs of Fajr, Maghrib and `Isha’, and in Jumu`ah, and to recite quietly in Dhuhr and `Asr, and the third Rak`ah of Maghrib, and the third and fourth rak`ahs of `Isha’. All of this is according to the consensus of the Muslims, in addition to the authentic Hadiths that all indicate that.” (Al-Majmu` Sharh Al-Muhadhdhab, 3/389)\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Recitation should be done quietly in Dhuhr and `Asr, and out loud in the first two Rak`ahs of Maghrib and `Isha’, and in all of Fajr prayer. … The basis for that is the action of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), as is proven by the narration of later generations from earlier generations. If a person recites out loud in a place where the recitation should be done quietly, or recites quietly in a place where recitation should be done out loud, he has neglected the Sunnah, although his prayer is valid.” (Al-Mughni, 2/270)\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 67618 , 26268 , 197414 , 91325 , and\xa0 114369 .\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/224152/which-prayers-are-prayed-loudly
