246484,"There is someone who embraced Islam and was Christian before. As for me, I was an atheist. Will those people attain the twofold reward because they were previously People of the Book? I ask Allah to bless them. All it is, is that I feel sad because I had to go through a lot of anguish before I came to know Allah, may He be blessed and exalted.","['Praise be to Allah.Al-Bukhari (3011) and Muslim (154) narrated from Abu Musa that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There are three who will be given a double reward: a man who has a slave woman whom he taught and taught her well, and he taught her manners and taught her well, then he set her free and married her – he will have a double reward; a believer from among the People of the Book, he was a believer, then he believed in the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) – he will have a double reward; and a slave who fulfils his duty towards Allah and is sincere towards his master.”\nWhoever believes in his Prophet then believes in Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) will have a twofold reward, one for believing in his Prophet (peace be upon him) and one for believing in our Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). This is in accordance with the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Those to whom We gave the scripture before are the ones who believe in it [the Quran].\nWhen it is recited to them, they say: We believe in it, for it is indeed the truth from our Lord. Verily, we had already submitted [to Allah, in Islam] before that.\nSuch people will be given a twofold reward for their patience and steadfastness; they repel evil with good, and spend out of that which We have provided for them}\xa0[al-Qasas 28:52-54].\nThis is specifically for those of the People of the Book hwhoe believe in him, so it does not include all disbelievers. al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe hadith applies only to the People of the Book, and it does not include others. Moreover, what we understand from his saying “he believed in his Prophet” is to highlight the great reward; in other words, the reason for the twofold reward is believing in two prophets, and the disbelievers are not like that. It may be said that the difference between the People of the Book and other disbelievers is that the People of the Book recognize Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{those who follow the Messenger, the unlettered Prophet, whom they find mentioned in their own [scriptures], in the Torah and the Gospel}\xa0[al-A‘raf 7:157].\nSo whoever among them believes in him and follows him will have an advantage over others.""(Al-Fath\xa0 1/191).\nThat is supported by the report narrated by Imam Ahmad (22234) from Abu Umamah, who said: I was beside the mount of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on the day of the conquest [of Makkah]. He spoke some pleasing words, and among the things he said was: “Whoever among the People of the two Books becomes Muslim will have a twofold reward, and his rights and duties are the same as ours. Whoever among the polytheists becomes Muslim will have his reward, and his rights and duties are the same as ours.”\nClassed as hasan by al-Albani in al-Sahihah (304).\nThus he differentiated between those of the People of the Book who become Muslim, as he said that they will have a twofold reward, and those of the polytheists who become Muslim, as he did not say that they would have that.\nThe fact that those of the People of the Book who become Muslim will have a twofold reward does not mean that they are better than others in definitive terms. Someone else, who was a polytheist or disbeliever and not one of the People of the Book, may become Muslim and practice Islam well, so he will be given a reward many times greater than that given to one of the People of the Book who becomes Muslim, because of his sound adherence to Islam, the strength of his faith and his righteous deeds. How many of the disbelievers became Muslim and Allah granted victory at their hands and benefitted the people through them, and many people became Muslim at their hands and many nations entered the religion of Islam because of them, such as Abu Bakr and ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with them). They are better and attained greater reward than Salman al-Farisi, ‘Abdullah ibn Salaam and others like them who were previously among the People of the Book –may Allah be pleased with them all.\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nNot everyone who receives a twofold reward is better than others.""(Fath al-Bari by Ibn Rajab 2/232).\nYou have hope, depending on what you do after you become Muslim. If you adhere sincerely to Islam, strive to do righteous deeds and remember that Allah is watching you and what you say and do in private and in public, and you devote yourself to your religion, learn its rulings and teachings, memorize His book and teach that to others, then you will attain of reward what no one knows except Allah, and perhaps you will have many times more reward than someone who attained a twofold reward.\nIf you suffered and went through anguish before, because of disbelief and being with disbelieving people, until Allah blessed you with Islam, then you should acknowledge the blessing that Allah has bestowed on you, give thanks to Him, may He be glorified, for His immense grace, and focus on worshipping and obeying Him. Do not think that what you missed out on of reward means that you cannot attain a better, greater and more generous reward than that. In fact, it is possible to attain that by the grace of Allah, so do not think too much about what you have missed out on of reward, and focus on what you should not miss out on, by doing righteous deeds and fearing Allah.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/246484/is-it-possible-for-someone-who-was-not-a-jew-or-christian-if-he-becomes-muslim-to-attain-multiple-rewards-as-the-former-jew-or-christian-will-attain-a-twofold-reward
125907,"I'm Insha Allah planning to get married soon, and the person of interest to me has come back to me stating the below two hadiths apply to both men & women when choosing their spouses. However I see it differently with men given more options in attributes to look for in a wife.","['Praise be to Allah.Religious commitment is the basis of choosing a spouse\nFirstly we should clarify that Islamic Shari`ah only encourages seeking a righteous wife who is religiously committed, and a righteous husband who is religious and good. Religious commitment is the first and foremost aim, and other characteristics such as beauty, wealth, high position and good lineage and so on are secondary matters. They are not blameworthy in and of themselves, but they are not the basic aims, rather they are complementary qualities. If they are present, then that is ideal, otherwise religious commitment is the basis of all goodness. \xa0\nThis is indicated by what is mentioned in the Sunnah of praise for some of these qualities in the wife . For example, it was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: It was said: O Messenger of Allah, which of women is best? He said: “The one who when he looks at her he is happy and she obeys him when he commands her, and does not go against his wishes with regard to herself or his wealth by doing what he dislikes.”\xa0(Narrated by Ahmad (2/251); classed as hasan by al-Albani in Al-Silsilah Al-Sahihah (1838)\xa0\nThe same applies to the husband. The basic principle is to seek marriage to a righteous, pious man , as described in the hadith in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “with whose religious commitment and good character you are pleased.” If that is accompanied by good looks, wealth and high position, that is a blessing from Allah.\xa0\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) regarded a man’s wasting his money and not being able to spend on his wife as a reason for not getting married to him. That appears in the hadith of Fatimah bint Qays (may Allah be pleased with her) who said: When my\xa0‘iddah ended, I told him – meaning the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) – that Mu’awiyah ibn Abi Sufyan and Abu Jahm had proposed marriage to me. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “As for Abu Jahm, his stick never leaves his shoulder. As for Mu’awiyah, he is very poor and has no wealth. Marry Usamah ibn Zayd.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1480)\xa0\nAl-‘Allamah al-Sa’di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“If there are other (good qualities) as well as religious commitment, that is good, otherwise religious commitment is the greatest of qualities to be sought.” (Bahjat Qulub Al-Abrar wa Qurrat ‘Uyun al-Akhyar fi Sharh Jawami’ al-Akhbar, p. 120)\xa0\nSeeking worldly characteristics in a spouse\nOnce the above is clear, we will know the answer to the question that was asked. We know that wealth, good lineage and good looks are things that are desirable in both spouses in most people’s view, both believers and disbelievers. Wanting these things is something that is natural in human beings. Islam does not object to that, rather they are not pointed out because people – by their nature – pay attention to these matters and seek them; they even exaggerate about that and neglect other important things. So Islam came to confirm what people neglect or ignore, even though this is the most desirable quality according to the standards of Shari`ah. This, also, is what distinguishes the attitude of the righteous believer from the attitude of anyone else.\xa0\nHence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, in the famous hadith:\n“Women may be married for four things : their wealth, their lineage, their beauty and their religious commitment. Choose the one who is religiously-committed, may your hands be rubbed with dust (i.e., may you prosper).” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari (5090), Muslim (1466)\xa0\nImam al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“The correct meaning of this hadith is that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was speaking of what people usually do; they seek these four qualities, and the last of them in their view is the one who is religiously committed, so seek, O you who are guided, the one who is religiously committed.” (Sharh Muslim, 10/51-52)\xa0\nAnd he (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“What that means is that people usually seek these four qualities in a woman, but you should seek the one who is religiously committed.” (Riyadh al-Salihin, p. 454)\xa0\nAl-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“These four qualities are those that are sought when marrying a woman. They are the qualities that men seek in women. So this is speaking of what happens; it is not a command to that effect. The apparent meaning is that it is permissible to seek all of these qualities when marrying, or one of them, but seeking religious commitment is best and most important.” (Al-Mufhim lima ashkala min Talkhis Sahih Muslim, 4/215)\nShaykh Sulayman ibn Mansur Al-‘Ujayli al-Jamal – who is one of the Shafi`i jurists – says:\xa0\nSome of them quoted this hadith as evidence that it is mustahabb for the woman to be beautiful, and al-Zarkashi disagreed with this understanding by saying that quoting it as evidence that she should be beautiful is strange, because this is a statement of what is usual among people, and it is not a command to marry beautiful women. This is a valid objection. Similarly it is not a command to marry the one who is wealthy, beautiful and of good lineage.” (Futuhat al-Wahhab bi Tawdih Sharh Manhaj Al-Tullab Al-Ma’ruf bi Hashiyat Al-Jamal, 4/118)\xa0\nSome scholars are of the view that these qualities are desirable according to Shari`ah, and that it is mustahabb for the suitor to seek them in the woman to whom he proposes, but it is stipulated that religious commitment should be the basis – also – and that none of the other qualities mentioned should supersede it. If there is any conflict, then religious commitment should always take precedence.\xa0\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \xa0\n“It may also be understood from it – i.e., from this hadith – that it is mustahabb for a man of noble descent to marry a woman who is his equal, but if there is a conflict: a woman of noble descent who is not religiously committed, or a religiously committed woman who is not of noble descent, then religious commitment should be given precedence, and so on with all the other characteristics.\xa0\nFrom the word “her beauty” it may be understood that it is mustahabb to marry a beautiful woman, but if there is a conflict: a beautiful woman who is not religiously committed, or a woman who is not beautiful but is religiously committed, yes, if they [the two women] are equal in terms of religious commitment then the beautiful one is better. We may add to this the one who is beautiful in terms of physical appearance and attitude\xa0\xa0 and the one who asks for a low dowry.\xa0\nThe words “Choose the one who is religiously committed” – what this means is that what is fitting for the man who is religiously-committed and decent is that religion should be his focus in all things, especially in matters that will be long-term. So the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) enjoined him to find a woman who is religiously committed, which is the ultimate goal. In the hadith of ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr, which is narrated by Ibn Majah in a marfu’ report [in which there is some weakness] it says: “Do not marry women for their beauty, for perhaps their beauty may lead to their doom. And do not marry them for their wealth, for perhaps their wealth may make them fall into sin; rather marry them for their religious commitment, and a black slave woman who is religiously committed is better.”\xa0 (Fath al-Bari, 9/135-136)\xa0\nMany Shafi`i books quote this hadith as evidence that it is mustahabb to marry a beautiful woman.\xa0\nIt says in Sharh Muntaha Al-Iradat (2/623), which is a Hanbali book: “It is also Sunnah to choose a beautiful woman because of this hadith [meaning the hadith quoted above].”\nThe matter is broad in scope, in sha Allah, so long as the primary goal of both spouses is agreed upon, which is religious commitment, and so long as the other, worldly characteristics are not blameworthy, rather they are praiseworthy.\xa0\nWhy desirable qualities in men for marriage are not mentioned in the hadith\nWith regard to the desirable qualities in men for marriage not being mentioned as they are in the case of women, that is not due to any differentiation between them, rather it is because usually it is the man who looks for a wife and seeks in her the qualities he chooses, and the woman usually thinks of the qualities of the man who proposes to her . So it is more appropriate that the words in the hadith “Women may be married for four things…” should be addressed in terms of what usually happens and is customary, not in terms of the rare exception.\xa0\nMoreover, Shar`i matters are usually addressed to men, and the scholars of Usul Al-Fiqh have stated that whatever is addressed to men is also addressed to women, unless there is evidence to the contrary, but it is not essential for there to be one text for men and another for women with regard to every Shar`i ruling. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Women are the twin halves of men.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (113) and others, classed as sahih by Al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami’.)\xa0\nFor more, please see these answers: 9602 , 101130 , and 10680 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/125907/what-to-look-for-in-a-spouse-in-islam
423278,"My mother died, may Allah have mercy on her, and she left behind an estate worth sixty thousand, including gold, money and a car. I have a young sister who is nine years old, and her estimated portion of the estate is five shares, which is approximately two thousand and five hundred. Should her portion include gold, money and a share of the car, in equal proportions, or should she take her share entirely in the form of gold, for example, and not receive anything of the money and so on?","['Praise be to Allah.When someone dies, his estate should be shared out among his heirs.\nThe basic principle is that everything that the deceased left behind – whether it was gold or cash or a car – should be shared out among all of his heirs, unless the heirs who are adults of sound mind agree to something else.\nSo the gold should be shared out by grams, and the cash should be shared out, and they all have a share of the car, or one of them may take it and compensate the others, or it may be sold and the price shared out among all the heirs.\nIn the case of a nine year old girl, if she has not yet reached puberty, or she has reached puberty but is not yet mature, meaning that she is not able to handle wealth properly, she should be given her share of everything, and it should be kept for her. It is not acceptable for her to agree with the other heirs on anything other than that, unless her guardian who takes care of her wealth agrees that that is more appropriate for her, so he does what is in her best interests, such as if he thinks that if she takes all of her share in the form of gold, that is better for her, for example. In that case, he may make all her share in the form of gold, so long as the other heirs agree to that.\nHer guardian who takes care of her wealth should be her father, or a man appointed by her father, or the ruler, or the judge, and the judge may appoint one of her relatives to be her guardian and take care of her wealth.\nThis is the view of the majority, but some scholars are of the view that guardianship of a minoer’s wealth should be given to the closest of the male relativeson the father’s side. This was narrated from Ahmad and was the view favoured by Ibn Taymiyah in al-Insaf (5/324). It was also deemed to be more correct by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin in al-Sharh al-Mumti‘ (9/305).\nThe guardian is obliged to handle the wealth in the way that is in the minor’s best interests.\nIt says in Manar al-Sabil (2/550): It is haram for the guardian of a minor, one who is insane or one who is legally incompetent to dispose of their wealth except in a manner that is beneficial to the minor and serves his best interests, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): { And do not approach the property of an orphan, except in the way that is best } [al-Isra’ 17:34]. The one who is legally incompetent and the one who is insane come under the same heading. End quote.\nIt says in Sharh Muntaha al-Iradat (2/175): “It is haram for the guardian of a minor or of one who is insane or legally incompetent to handle that person’s wealth in any manner except that which is beneficial to the one who is deemed incompetent and unable to handle it, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): { And do not approach the property of an orphan, except in the way that is best } [al-Isra’ 17:34], and the one who is legally incompetent and the one who is insane come under the same ruling.\nIf the guardian gives something of the minor’s wealth in charity or as a gift, or shows favouritism to a third party by selling him some of the minor’s property for a price lower than the real price, or he buys something for him for a price higher than the real price, or he spends more on the maintenance of the minor or the one who is insane than is required according to custom, or he spends more than is reasonable on the maintenance of their dependents, then he is liable for what he donated or what he did on the basis of favouritism, or what he spent more than what is required for maintenance, because of his negligence. End quote.\nBased on that, if the girl’s guardian thinks that it is in her best interests for her share of the estate to be all gold, or all cash, he may do that, with the consent of the other heirs.\nBut if each heir insists on taking his share of each type of wealth, then they have the right to do that.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/423278/should-a-young-girl-receive-a-share-from-all-of-the-estate
145200,I have read the fatwas on your website regarding the Sutrah and I am still confused about the following two items:,"['Praise be to Allah.Is having a Sutrah obligatory?\nIt is recommended for the Imam and the one who is praying alone to pray facing a Sutrah, because of the report narrated by Abu Dawud (598) from Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When one of you prays, let him pray facing a Sutrah and let him draw close to it.” Shaykh Al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Its Isnad (chain of narrators) is authentic.”\xa0\nPurpose of placing a Sutrah in prayer\nIt says in Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah (24/177):\xa0\n“It is Sunnah for the worshipper, if he is praying alone or as an Imam, to place a Sutrah in front of him to prevent people from walking in front of him , and to enable him to focus properly on the actions of the prayer. That is because of the report narrated by Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him), that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: ‘When one of you prays, let him pray facing a Sutrah and let him draw close to it and not let anyone pass in front of him .’ And because he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Let one of you face a Sutrah when praying, even if it is an arrow.’\xa0\nAs for the one who is praying behind an Imam, it is not recommended for him to use a Sutrah according to scholarly consensus, because the Sutrah of the Imam is the Sutrah of the one who is praying behind him, or because the Imam is a Sutrah for him.”\nHow high should the Sutrah be?\nThe Sunnah is for the worshipper to use something standing as a Sutrah, and it is better if it is the height of the back of a saddle or more, because of the report narrated by Muslim (771) from `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was asked about the Sutrah for one who is praying and he said: “Like the back of a saddle.”\xa0\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“This Hadith indicates that it is recommended to place a Sutrah in front of the one who is praying, and it explains that the minimum Sutrah is the back of a saddle, which is the length of the forearm, or approximately two thirds of a cubit. This purpose may be served by anything that he sets up in front of him."" (Sharh Muslim, 4/216)\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“With regard to whether it should be thick or thin, there is no definition that we are aware of. It may be thin like an arrow or a spear, or it may be thick like a wall. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to use a short spear as a Sutrah .\xa0\nAbu Sa`id (may Allah be pleased with him) said: We used to use an arrow or a rock as a Sutrah for prayer. It was also narrated from Saburah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Use a Sutrah for prayer even if it is an arrow.’ (Narrated by Al-Athram)\nAl-Awza `i (may Allah have mercy on him) said: ‘An arrow or a whip is sufficient.’ Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) said: ‘I prefer it to be broader than that, because the words ‘even if it is an arrow’ indicate that something else is more appropriate than it’” (Al-Mughni, 2/38)\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about the size of the Sutrah for one who is praying.\xa0\nHe replied:\xa0\n“The best Sutrah that a person puts when he prays is the height of the back of a saddle, approximately two-thirds of a cubit, but if it is less than that, it does not matter; even if it is an arrow or a stick, it is acceptable."" (Majmu` Fatawa Ibn `Uthaymin, 13/326)\xa0\nStanding close to the Sutrah\xa0\nThe Sunnah is for the worshipper to stand close to his Sutrah, so that he can stop anyone who tries to walk in front of him , because of the report narrated by Abu Dawud (695) from Sahl ibn Abu Hathmah (may Allah be pleased with him) from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) who said: “When one of you prays facing a Sutrah, let him draw close to it lest satan interrupt his prayer.” (Classed as sound by Ibn `Abd Al-Barr in At-Tamhid (4/195); classed as authentic by An-Nawawi in Al-Majmu` (4/195) and by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud)\nThe scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) differed concerning the distance and from where it should be measured.\xa0\n\nSome of them said that the distance is three cubits from the feet of the one who is praying, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) prayed in the Ka`bah with three cubits between him and the wall. (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 506). This is the view of the Hanafis, Shafa`is and Hanbalis, and it is what is understood from the words of Malik, because the distance between the one who is praying and the Sutrah should be as much as he needs to stand, bow and prostrate. \xa0(See: Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah, 24/184)\nOthers were of the view that the distance should be sufficient to allow a sheep to pass, from the place where the worshipper prostrates, because of the report narrated by Al-Bukhari (474) and Muslim (508) from Sahl ibn Sa`d (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: Between the place where the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) prayed and the wall there was a space where a sheep could pass.\xa0\n\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“In the Hadith, Between the place where the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) prayed and the wall there was a space where a sheep could pass, what is meant by ‘the place where he prayed’ is the place where he prostrated. This indicates that the Sunnah is for the one who is praying to be close to his Sutrah.”\xa0\n\nSome scholars reconcile between the Hadith of Ibn `Umar and that of Sahl ibn Sa`d (may Allah be pleased with them both) by interpreting the Hadith of Ibn `Umar, which mentions three cubits, as applying when the worshipper is standing, and the Hadith of Sahl, which mentions a space where a sheep could pass, as applying when the worshipper is prostrating.”\xa0\n\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/145200/how-high-should-the-sutrah-be
