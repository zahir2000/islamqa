103514,Could you give me a list of all or most of the miracles of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)?,"['Praise be to Allah.The miracles of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) were many, over a thousand, as was stated by the great scholar Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) in Ighathat al-Lahfan (2/691). These miracles include some that occurred and are finished, and one of them is that which will continue for as long as Allah, may He be exalted, wills. It is the greatest miracle and the greatest sign of the prophethood of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). It is the Holy Quran, the sign that will remain and continue, that cannot be subjected to change or alteration. It is miraculous in many ways, including its wording, for Allah challenged the most eloquent of the Arabs to produce a single soorah like it, and they were unable to do that.\nIt is miraculous in what it contains of the foretelling of future events which came to pass as it foretold, such as the passage in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Alif, Lam, Mim.\nThe Byzantines have been defeated\nIn the nearest land.\xa0But they, after their defeat, will overcome\nWithin three to nine years}\n[ar-Rum 30:1-4].\nIt is miraculous in what it contains of perfect legislation; humanity could not produce such legislation by themselves.\nIt is miraculous in what it contains of knowledge and information about the secrets of this universe, which modern science is still discovering, day after day, more of these secrets.\nWith regard to the miracles which happened and ended, they are many, as we noted above. The most famous of them include:\n1.. The miracle of the Prophet’s Night Journey and Ascent to Heave (al-Isra’ wa’l-Mi‘raj). The Quran mentions the night journey clearly and refers to the ascent to heaven. And there are authentic hadiths in the Sunnah which describe the ascent to heaven and what happened during it.\n2.. The miracle of the splitting of the moon, which is mentioned in the Quran, and there are many hadiths transmitted by many narrators which speak of it, as Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said. The Muslims are unanimously agreed on that.\n3.. The increase of small amounts of food at the hands of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), so that the army who were with him could eat, and there would still be food left over. There are hadiths which speak of this in al-Bukhari and Muslim, and other books of hadith.\n4.. The springing forth of water from between the fingers of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and the increase of water so that the entire army could drink from it and do wudu’ with it. There are hadiths which speak of this in al-Bukhari and Muslim.\n5.. The Prophet’s foretelling of matters of the future unseen, which then came to pass as he foretold. Many things that he foretold came to pass and we still see things happening that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) foretold.\n6.. The grieving of the date palm trunk when he stopped preaching beside it and began to use the minbar. The hadith concerning that is in Sahih al-Bukhari.\n7.. The rock greeting him with salaam when he was in Makkah. The hadith concerning that was narrated by Muslim.\n8.. Healing the sick. There are many hadiths which speak of that in al-Bukhari and Muslim, and elsewhere.\nAs we stated above, his miracles were many, and this is just a glimpse of them. The scholars have compiled many books listing the miracles of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), such as Dala’il an-Nubuwwah by al-Bayhaqi, A‘lam an-Nubuwwah by al-Mawardi, and the book of ‘aqidah (creed) are filled with mention of his miracles under the heading of belief in the messengers.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/103514/some-of-the-miracles-of-the-messenger-blessings-and-peace-of-allah-be-upon-him
343994,"Are all the branches of faith obligatory, in the sense that if someone does not do them he will fall into sin?","['Praise be to Allah.Levels and branches of faith\nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Faith has seventy-odd – or sixty-odd – branches, the best of which is saying La ilaha ill-Allah (there is no god worthy of worship except Allah), and the least of which is removing something harmful from the road, and modesty is a branch of faith.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 9 and Muslim, 35).\nThis hadith states that faith has many branches and characteristics, but it does not state the ruling on each branch; rather it indicates that they are of various levels of importance.\nAre all the branches of faith obligatory?\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIn the report of Muslim with the addition, it says: “the highest of which is saying La ilaha ill-Allah (there is no god worthy of worship except Allah), and the least of which is removing something harmful from the road.” This indicates that their levels of importance vary. (End quote from Fath al-Bari, 1/53).\nThe fact that they are listed under the heading of faith does not mean that they are all obligatory, because when the word faith (iman) appears on its own, it includes all good and righteous deeds, both obligatory and recommended.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhen the word faith (iman) appears on its own in the Qur’an and Sunnah, what is meant is that which is meant by the words righteousness, piety and religion, as noted above. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) stated that “Faith has seventy-odd branches, the best of which is saying La ilaha ill-Allah (there is no god worthy of worship except Allah), and the least of which is removing something harmful from the road.” Thus everything that Allah loves is included under the heading of faith. (End quote from Majmu‘ al-Fatawa, 7/179).\nAllah, may He be exalted, has also called prayer faith (iman), as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And never would Allah have caused you to lose your faith [i.e., your previous prayers]. Indeed Allah is, to the people, Kind and Merciful}\n[al-Baqarah 2:143].\nIt was narrated that Zuhayr said: Abu Is-haq told us, on the authority of al-Bara’ ibn ‘Azib, that when the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) first came to Madinah, he stayed with the descendants of his grandfathers – or his maternal uncles – among the Ansar, and he prayed facing towards Bayt al-Maqdis (Jerusalem) for sixteen or seventeen months, but he wished that his qiblah could be facing towards the Ka‘bah. The first prayer that he offered facing towards the Ka‘bah was ‘Asr prayer, and some people prayed with him. Then one of the men who had prayed with him went out and passed by some people in a mosque who were bowing, so he said: I bear witness by Allah that I have just prayed with the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) facing towards Makkah. So they turned around, as they were, to face towards the Ka‘bah. It had pleased the Jews and the People of the Book when he used to pray facing towards Bayt al-Maqdis, but when he turned to face towards the Ka‘bah, they disapproved of that.\nZuhayr said: Abu Is-haq told us, on the authority of al-Bara’ in this hadith that some men had died or been killed when they were still praying towards the [first] qiblah, before it was changed, and we did not know what to say about them [and their prayers]. Then Allah, may He be exalted, revealed the words:\n{And never would Allah have caused you to lose your faith [i.e., your previous prayers]}\n[al-Baqarah 2:143].\n(Narrated by al-Bukhari, 40).\nIbn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n‘Ubaydullah ibn Musa said: This hadith tells you that prayer is part of faith, and this is what al-Bukhari stated in his chapter heading here, and quoted the hadith of al-Bara’ under this heading for that reason.\nSimilarly, Ibn ‘Uyaynah and other scholars quoted this verse as evidence that prayer is part of faith. Those who narrated from him that this verse is to be interpreted as referring to prayer in the direction of Jerusalem include Ibn ‘Abbas, according to al-‘Awfi’s report from him, Sa‘id ibn al-Musayyab, Ibn Zayd, as-Suddi and others.\nQatadah and ar-Rabi‘ ibn Anas said: This verse was revealed because some of the Muslims said: What about our deeds that we did when facing towards our first qiblah?\nThis indicates that what is meant by faith here is prayer, because prayer is the only deed that requires one to face towards the qiblah.\nMost of the commentators did not mention any difference of opinion regarding that and regarding the fact that what is meant by faith here is prayer, for prayer is the sign of faith and the greatest physical manifestation thereof. (End quote from Fath al-Bari, 1/190).\nSome prayers are obligatory and some are supererogatory.\nHence those scholars who tried to list all the branches of faith included prayer, both obligatory and supererogatory.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nFaith is composed of fundamental elements without which it cannot be complete, and others which are obligatory and if a person does not do these things, his faith is lacking to the extent that he deserves punishment. Other elements are recommended, meaning that if they are lacking, the individual will miss out on attaining a high degree of faith. Thus a person may fall into one of three caregories: wronging himself, moderate, or foremost in doing good deeds. (End quote from Majmu‘ al-Fatawa, 7/637).\nMoreover, the revelation did not mention the names of all of these branches. This is by way of motivating people to strive hard in doing acts of worship in general, by persisting in doing obligatory acts, and striving hard and competing to do recommended acts.\nAbu’l-‘Abbas al-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhat the hadith means is that the deeds that are prescribed in Islam are called faith on the basis of what we have mentioned above, in that they are limited to that number, but the religious texts did not specify that number for us or explain it in detail.\nOne of the later scholars put unnecessary effort into trying to list these branches of faith, so he examined the righteous deeds prescribed by Islam and counted them, until – according to his claim – he reached that number. But that number is not correct, because it is possible to add to what he listed or to subtract from it, by highlighting the overlap between some of them.\nThe correct view is the conclusion reached by Abu Sulayman al-Khattabi and others, which is that this number is something that is known only to Allah, may He be exalted, and to His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and you find it explained in details in Islamic teachings, but the religious texts did not give headings to these branches of faith or tell us about their number or how they are to be categorized. However, the fact that we do not know the details of what is enjoined upon us in the teachings of Islam does not hinder us, because all of that is discussed and explained in general terms in Islam. Therefore whatever the religious texts enjoin us to do, we do it, and whatever they forbid us to do, we refrain from it, even though we do not know the total number of that. And Allah, may He be exalted, knows best. (End quote from al-Mufhim, 1/217).\nAre the branches of faith limited to the number mentioned in the hadith only?\nThere could be some confusion resulting from the fact that if you tried to find out the number of good deeds, whether they are obligatory or recommended, the number would be much greater than what is mentioned in the hadith. The scholars have responded to this confusion in several ways, which were mentioned by Ibn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) when he said:\nIn the view of the Sunni scholars of hadith, each righteous deed and act of obedience comes under the heading of faith, whether it is a physical action, a deed of the heart or words, and obligatory and supererogatory deeds are the same in that regard. This is the view of the vast majority of scholars, and as that is the case, the number is not limited to seventy-odd; rather it is much greater than that and is in fact unlimited.\nIt was said: we may respond to this [confusion] in several ways:\nFirstly: it may be said that when the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) mentioned the number of branches of faith, they were limited to that number, then others were added after that, until at the end of the Prophet’s life, the number of branches of faith was completed.\nHowever, there are some reservations about that.\nSecondly: the branches of faith are limited to seventy-odd types, but each type may be a heading for many things, and some of them may be unlimited. This is more likely to be correct, even though learning about all of them is difficult, if not impossible.\nThirdly: mentioning seventy is by way of indicating that the number is great, and is not by way of limiting it to that number, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{If you should ask forgiveness for them seventy times – never will Allah forgive them}\n[at-Tawbah 9:80].\nWhat is meant in this verse is to signify a great number, without limiting it to the number mentioned. Mentioning seventy-odd branches gives that impression, so it is as if he was saying that they are more than seventy, which implies that the number is great and many times more than what is mentioned. This was stated by the earlier hadith scholars, but there are some reservations about that.\nFourthly: these seventy-odd branches are the best and most sublime of the branches of faith, and they are the most necessary. This was stated by Ibn Hamid, among our companions. (End quote from Fath al-Bari, 1/30-31).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/343994/are-all-the-branches-of-faith-obligatory
212088,"I was praying `Asr in congregation, and I was trying to prevent passing wind by contracting my muscles, so that no wind would come out of me. After a few seconds, the pressure of gas stopped, and we went down in prostration. Then I felt something at the anus, but I was not sure whether it was really wind, and I did not hear or smell anything. Then I remembered the principle which states that certainty cannot be dispelled by uncertainty, and we finished the prayer. But I do not know whether I did the right thing or not, because I felt the pressure of gas for a few seconds before breaking wind. So do I have to repeat the prayer?","['Praise be to Allah.Can you pray while resisting the urge to relieve yourself?\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade praying when resisting the urge to relieve oneself and when one is distracted by trying to keep it from coming out.\nIt was narrated that `A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “There is no prayer when food is ready, or when one is resisting the urge to relieve oneself (by urinating or defecating).” (Narrated by Muslim, 560)\nImam An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his commentary on Sahih Muslim (5/46):\n“In these Hadiths we see that it is disliked to pray when food is ready that one wants to eat, because this is a distraction and it causes one to not have proper focus. It is also disliked when one is resisting the urge to relieve oneself – which refers to urine and stools.” (End quote)\nBut this regarding it as being disliked applies only to starting to pray whilst resisting the urge to relieve oneself. But if a person starts to pray when he does not feel that he is resisting the urge to defecate or urinate, and he only starts to feel that in the middle of the prayer, then in that case it is not disliked if it does not prevent him from completing his prayer.\nThe Standing Committee for Academic Research and Issuing Fatwas was asked: Sometimes I resist the urge to defecate before praying, and I pray but I do not feel that urge during the prayer; is my prayer acceptable? Sometimes the opposite happens; is my prayer acceptable?\nThe committee replied:\n“It is not permissible for the worshipper to start praying when he is resisting the urge to defecate or urinate, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no prayer when food is ready, or when one is resisting the urge to relieve oneself.” (Narrated by Muslim)\nThe reason behind that – and Allah knows best – is that this prevents proper focus in the prayer, but if he prays in that state, his prayer is still valid, but it is lacking and is imperfect, because of the Hadith quoted above, and he does not have to repeat it. But if you start to pray when you are not resisting the urge to relieve yourself, and you only start to feel that during the prayer, then the prayer is valid and is not disliked, provided that this urge did not prevent you from completing the prayer.\xa0(End quote from Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah lil-Buhuth Al-`Ilmiyyah wal-Ifta’, 7/25-26)\nWhat to do if you pass wind during prayer?\nIf a person is not sure whether wind came out of him, his Wudu is not invalidated by this mere uncertainty; rather he has to carry on with his prayer, and in this case his prayer is valid and he does not have to repeat it, unless he is certain that he did pass wind.\nAl-Bukhari (137) and Muslim (361) narrated from Sa`id ibn Al-Musayyab, and from `Abbad ibn Tamim, from his paternal uncle, that he complained to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) about when a man thinks that something has happened during the prayer. He said: “Do not stop unless you hear a sound or notice a smell.”\nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If one of you feels something in his stomach and is not sure whether something came out of him or not, let him not leave the mosque unless he hears a sound or notices a smell.” (Narrated by Muslim, 362)\nBut it should be noted that what is meant by hearing a sound or noticing a smell refers to when one is certain that he has passed wind and broken his Wudu, no matter what it is that has broken it.\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar said: “The Hadith indicates that prayer is valid so long as one is not certain of having broken wind; it does not mean that the only way to be certain is by these two things – i.e., smelling and hearing.” (End quote from Fat-h Al-Bari Sharh Sahih Al-Bukhari, 238)\nIn Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah lil-Buhuth Al-`Ilmiyyah wal-Ifta’ (5/255) it says:\n“Question: does all wind that comes out of a man invalidate his Wudu (I know that it does invalidate it), but my question is: when does it invalidate it, i.e., does it invalidate it when there is a sound and a smell and a sensation all together, or is it when there is a sound and a smell only, and the sensation is not included in that?\nI hope that you will explain this matter to me, may Allah bless you, because I am confused about this matter.\nAnswer: praise be to Allah alone, and blessings and peace be upon His Messenger and his family and companions. To proceed:\nWhat you have mentioned about things that invalidate Wudu apply when one is certain that something has come out of him because he heard a sound or noticed a smell, or because of any other thing by which one becomes certain that he has passed wind. That is because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said, when he was asked about a man who feels something during the prayer: “He should not stop until he hears a sound or notices a smell.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim)\nCan certainty be dispelled by uncertainty?\nThis principle – that certainty cannot be dispelled by uncertainty – is a general principle and does not apply only to purification and prayer.\nImam An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“This Hadith points to one of the basic principles of Islam and one of the most important guidelines of Fiqh, which is that things are deemed to remain as they originally were unless one becomes certain that they are otherwise, and fleeting uncertainty does not affect that. An example of that is the issue mentioned in the Hadith, which is that if a person is certain that he was in a state of purity and is uncertain as to whether that has been invalidated, then he is deemed to still be in a state of purity, and it makes no difference whether this uncertainty arose during the prayer itself or outside of prayer. This is our view and the view of the majority of scholars of the earlier and later generations.\nAnother example of the principle mentioned above is when a man is uncertain as to whether he has divorced his wife or freed his slave, or he is uncertain as to whether pure water has been rendered impure, or something impure has been purified, or whether a garment or food or anything else is impure, or whether he has prayed three rak`ahs or four, or he has bowed and prostrated or not, or whether he formed the intention to fast or pray or do Wudu or observe I`tikaf whilst he is doing these acts of worship, and other similar matters. All of this uncertainty has no impact at all, and the basic principle remains that this thing has not happened.\nThe scholars made exceptions from this principle in some cases, which are well known in the books of Fiqh and there is no room to explain them here. They are discussed in many books, there are counter-arguments and responses thereto, and there are differences of opinion concerning some of them.” (End quote from Sharh Sahih Muslim by An-Nawawi, 4/49-50)\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“This – I mean basing things on certainty and ignoring uncertainty – is an important principle which is supported by the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “If one of you is uncertain about his prayer, let him ignore what is uncertain and continue on the basis of what is certain.” There are many issues connected to this principle in matters of divorce, contracts and so on; if a person were to follow them it would solve many problems and dispel a great deal of compulsive thoughts and doubts. This is by the blessing of the words and rulings of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nIt is also one of the ways in which Islam makes things easy, for the aim is not to subject the Muslims to anxiety and confusion; rather the aim is to make their affairs clear and straightforward. If a person were to give in to such uncertainty, his life would be hard, because the devil will never stop at these whispers and doubts about matters of purification only; rather he will try to affect him in matters of prayer, fasting and other things, and in all areas of his life, even with his family. So the Lawgiver seeks to cut off these whispers at their roots by telling us to ignore them and to ward them off so that they will not have any effect on us.” (End quote from Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti` `ala Zad Al-Mustaqni`, 1/312)\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/212088/what-to-do-if-you-pass-wind-during-prayer
