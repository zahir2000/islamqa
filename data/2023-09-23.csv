112116,Is it permissible for the one who has been accused of adultery to pardon the one who accused him and waive the punishment for him?,"['Praise be to Allah.The one who accuses a chaste person of adultery must be subjected to the hadd punishment for such slander, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And those who accuse chaste women and then do not produce four witnesses - lash them with eighty lashes}\xa0[An-Nur 24:4].\nThe hadd punishment for accusing a chaste person of adultery is the right of the one who has been accused, because the purpose of this punishment is to confirm the innocence of the one who was wrongly accused and to show that the accuser is lying. Hence the hadd punishment for accusing a chaste person of adultery cannot be carried out unless the one who has been accused demands that. This is the view of the four imams (Abu Hanifah, Malik, al-Shafa‘i and Ahmad).\nIn fact, if the one who has been accused demands that the hadd punishment be carried out then pardons the accuser, the punishment is waived, just as if there is a demand for legal retaliation (qisas), then the victim [or his heirs] pardon the perpetrator.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Mughni (12/386):\nWhat matters in order for the hadd punishment [for accusing a chaste person of adultery] to be carried out is that the one who was accused should demand it, because it is his right. Therefore it cannot be done before he demands it, as in the case of all other rights…\nIf he demands that the hadd punishment be carried out, then pardons the accuser, the punishment is waived. This is the view of ash-Shafa‘i. End quote.\nIt says in Zad al-Mustaqni‘: That is the right of the one who was accused.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his commentary:\nThat – meaning the hadd punishment for accusing a chaste person of adultery is something that is due to the one who was accused, and it is not something that is due to Allah. Abu Hanifah said: It is something that is due to Allah, may He be glorified and exalted.\nBased on that, the one who was accused has the right to waive the punishment if he pardons the accuser. So if he pardons him after he accused him of adultery, then the hadd punishment for that is waived, because it is something that is due to him. This is like if he was owed money, then he waived the loan; in that case the loan would be waived. Thus he cannot take what is due to him without demanding it. Therefore so long as the one who was accused remained silent, we do not say anything to the one who accused him, and even if the case reaches the authorities, no hadd punishment can be carried out on him, unless the one who was wrongfully accused comes and demands that… Therefore several things result from the fact that demanding the hadd punishment is the right of the one who was accused, including the following:\n1. It is waived if he pardons him.\n2. The punishment cannot be carried out without his request… The more correct scholarly view is that that is the right of the one who was accused.""(Ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘\xa0 14/284-286).\nSee also: al-Majmu‘ (22/128); Hashiyat ad-Dasuqi (6/331).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/112116/is-it-permissible-for-the-one-who-has-been-accused-of-adultery-to-pardon-the-one-who-accused-him-and-waive-the-punishment-for-him
114847,"I had a share portfolio and someone bought it from me to be paid later, on condition that he give me its value with added value one and a half years after buying it from me. How should I give zakah on it? Should I give zakah on its original price when it was bought, or the value that the buyer will give me in one and a half years’ time? Please note that he has already sold the contents of the portfolio and is buying and selling shares.","['Praise be to Allah.If you sold the share portfolio to be paid for later on, this price is a debt that is owed by the buyer, and comes under the rulings of zakah on debts.\nIt is well known that if someone is owed a debt by someone else, then zakah on it is subject to the following considerations:\nIf the debt is owed by one who is well-off and willing to pay, and he acknowledges the debt and has the ability to pay it, then zakah must be paid on the debt when one year has passed, as if the money was in your possession.\nBut if the debt is owed by someone who is delaying payment or denying the debt, you do not have to pay zakah on it until you receive it and one full year has passed since you received it.\nPlease see the answer to question no. 106434 .\nThus you will realise that zakah is to be paid on the price that you will receive, and not the original value of the portfolio, because this price has become a debt that is owed to you, so you should give zakah on the debt as noted above, whether the buyer has sold the contents of the portfolio or not.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/114847/he-sold-a-share-portfolio-to-be-paid-for-in-a-year-and-a-halfs-time-does-he-have-to-give-zakah-on-it
