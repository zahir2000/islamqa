130943,"What is the ruling on calling people by names of Allah such as Karim, ‘Aziz and so on?","['Praise be to Allah.Calling people by the names of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, falls into two categories.\nThe first category is divided into two types:\nThe first type is where the name is preceded by the definite article al-. In this case, no one may be called by this name except Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, such as if anyone were to be called al-‘Aziz, as-Sayyid, al-Hakim, and so on. No one can be called by these names except Allah, because the definite article al- in this case indicates that what is referred to is the divine name.\nThe second type is where the name is chosen for its divine meaning, but is not preceded with the definite article al-. In this case, such names should not be used. It is for this reason that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) changed the kunyah of Abu’l-Hakam, because the latter’s companions used to refer to him for judgement. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Indeed it is Allah Who is al-Hakam [the Judge], and He is the One to judge.” Then he gave him a kunyah using the name of his oldest son, Shurayh [so he became known as Abu Shurayh]. This indicates that if someone is named by one of the names of Allah, intending the meaning of that divine name, this is not allowed, because in that case the name is exactly the same as the name of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. The names of Allah, may He be exalted, are names and attributes, with divine meanings.\nThe second category is names that are not preceded by the definite article, and the intention is not to refer to the divine meaning. In this case, there is nothing wrong with these names, such as Hakim (wise). The name of one of the Sahabah was Hakim ibn Hizam, to whom the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not sell what you do not possess.” This indicates that if the intention is not to connect it to the meaning of the divine name or attribute, there is nothing wrong with it.\nBut names such as Jabbar should not be used, even if the intention is not to connect it to the meaning of the divine name or attribute, because the name may have some impact on the person who is so named, so that he may become tyrannical or arrogant or think that he is above other people. Such things may have an impact on a person, so they should be avoided. And Allah knows best.

315513,"If it becomes known in the third month of pregnancy that the foetus has Down syndrome, is it permissible to abort it?","['Praise be to Allah.If it is proven and confirmed by a committee of trustworthy doctors that the foetus has Down syndrome, and that is before the pregnancy has reached 120 days, it is permissible to abort it.\nIt is not permissible to abort it after 120 days.\nIt says in a statement of the Islamic Fiqh Council belonging to the Muslim World league, issued during its twelfth session, held in Makkah al-Mukarramah, 15 Rajab 1410 AH/10 February 1990 CE:\nIf the pregnancy has reached one hundred and twenty days, it is not permissible to abort it, even if the medical diagnosis indicates that there is a physical deformity, unless it is proven by a medical report from a council of trustworthy specialist doctors that continuing the pregnancy will definitely pose a risk to the life of the mother. In that case it is permissible to abort it, whether it is deformed or not, so as to ward off the greater of two harms.\nBut before one hundred and twenty days of the pregnancy have passed, if it is proven and confirmed by a medical committee of trustworthy specialist doctors, based on medical examinations and laboratory tests that the foetus is severely deformed and cannot be treated, and that if the pregnancy continues and the child is born at full term, his life will be unbearable and will cause suffering to him and his family, then in that case it is permissible to abort the foetus, if the parents request that.\nHaving stated the above, the Council advises doctors and parents to fear Allah and verify this matter [before proceeding with an abortion].""(Qararat al-Majma‘ al-Fiqhi al-Islami bi Makkah al-Mukarramah, p.277).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/315513/ruling-on-aborting-a-foetus-with-down-syndrome
