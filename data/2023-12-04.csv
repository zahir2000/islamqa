423278,"My mother died, may Allah have mercy on her, and she left behind an estate worth sixty thousand, including gold, money and a car. I have a young sister who is nine years old, and her estimated portion of the estate is five shares, which is approximately two thousand and five hundred. Should her portion include gold, money and a share of the car, in equal proportions, or should she take her share entirely in the form of gold, for example, and not receive anything of the money and so on?","['Praise be to Allah.When someone dies, his estate should be shared out among his heirs.\nThe basic principle is that everything that the deceased left behind – whether it was gold or cash or a car – should be shared out among all of his heirs, unless the heirs who are adults of sound mind agree to something else.\nSo the gold should be shared out by grams, and the cash should be shared out, and they all have a share of the car, or one of them may take it and compensate the others, or it may be sold and the price shared out among all the heirs.\nIn the case of a nine year old girl, if she has not yet reached puberty, or she has reached puberty but is not yet mature, meaning that she is not able to handle wealth properly, she should be given her share of everything, and it should be kept for her. It is not acceptable for her to agree with the other heirs on anything other than that, unless her guardian who takes care of her wealth agrees that that is more appropriate for her, so he does what is in her best interests, such as if he thinks that if she takes all of her share in the form of gold, that is better for her, for example. In that case, he may make all her share in the form of gold, so long as the other heirs agree to that.\nHer guardian who takes care of her wealth should be her father, or a man appointed by her father, or the ruler, or the judge, and the judge may appoint one of her relatives to be her guardian and take care of her wealth.\nThis is the view of the majority, but some scholars are of the view that guardianship of a minoer’s wealth should be given to the closest of the male relativeson the father’s side. This was narrated from Ahmad and was the view favoured by Ibn Taymiyah in al-Insaf (5/324). It was also deemed to be more correct by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin in al-Sharh al-Mumti‘ (9/305).\nThe guardian is obliged to handle the wealth in the way that is in the minor’s best interests.\nIt says in Manar al-Sabil (2/550): It is haram for the guardian of a minor, one who is insane or one who is legally incompetent to dispose of their wealth except in a manner that is beneficial to the minor and serves his best interests, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): { And do not approach the property of an orphan, except in the way that is best } [al-Isra’ 17:34]. The one who is legally incompetent and the one who is insane come under the same heading. End quote.\nIt says in Sharh Muntaha al-Iradat (2/175): “It is haram for the guardian of a minor or of one who is insane or legally incompetent to handle that person’s wealth in any manner except that which is beneficial to the one who is deemed incompetent and unable to handle it, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): { And do not approach the property of an orphan, except in the way that is best } [al-Isra’ 17:34], and the one who is legally incompetent and the one who is insane come under the same ruling.\nIf the guardian gives something of the minor’s wealth in charity or as a gift, or shows favouritism to a third party by selling him some of the minor’s property for a price lower than the real price, or he buys something for him for a price higher than the real price, or he spends more on the maintenance of the minor or the one who is insane than is required according to custom, or he spends more than is reasonable on the maintenance of their dependents, then he is liable for what he donated or what he did on the basis of favouritism, or what he spent more than what is required for maintenance, because of his negligence. End quote.\nBased on that, if the girl’s guardian thinks that it is in her best interests for her share of the estate to be all gold, or all cash, he may do that, with the consent of the other heirs.\nBut if each heir insists on taking his share of each type of wealth, then they have the right to do that.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/423278/should-a-young-girl-receive-a-share-from-all-of-the-estate
145200,I have read the fatwas on your website regarding the Sutrah and I am still confused about the following two items:,"['Praise be to Allah.Is having a Sutrah obligatory?\nIt is recommended for the Imam and the one who is praying alone to pray facing a Sutrah, because of the report narrated by Abu Dawud (598) from Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When one of you prays, let him pray facing a Sutrah and let him draw close to it.” Shaykh Al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Its Isnad (chain of narrators) is authentic.”\xa0\nPurpose of placing a Sutrah in prayer\nIt says in Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah (24/177):\xa0\n“It is Sunnah for the worshipper, if he is praying alone or as an Imam, to place a Sutrah in front of him to prevent people from walking in front of him , and to enable him to focus properly on the actions of the prayer. That is because of the report narrated by Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him), that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: ‘When one of you prays, let him pray facing a Sutrah and let him draw close to it and not let anyone pass in front of him .’ And because he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Let one of you face a Sutrah when praying, even if it is an arrow.’\xa0\nAs for the one who is praying behind an Imam, it is not recommended for him to use a Sutrah according to scholarly consensus, because the Sutrah of the Imam is the Sutrah of the one who is praying behind him, or because the Imam is a Sutrah for him.”\nHow high should the Sutrah be?\nThe Sunnah is for the worshipper to use something standing as a Sutrah, and it is better if it is the height of the back of a saddle or more, because of the report narrated by Muslim (771) from `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was asked about the Sutrah for one who is praying and he said: “Like the back of a saddle.”\xa0\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“This Hadith indicates that it is recommended to place a Sutrah in front of the one who is praying, and it explains that the minimum Sutrah is the back of a saddle, which is the length of the forearm, or approximately two thirds of a cubit. This purpose may be served by anything that he sets up in front of him."" (Sharh Muslim, 4/216)\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“With regard to whether it should be thick or thin, there is no definition that we are aware of. It may be thin like an arrow or a spear, or it may be thick like a wall. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to use a short spear as a Sutrah .\xa0\nAbu Sa`id (may Allah be pleased with him) said: We used to use an arrow or a rock as a Sutrah for prayer. It was also narrated from Saburah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Use a Sutrah for prayer even if it is an arrow.’ (Narrated by Al-Athram)\nAl-Awza `i (may Allah have mercy on him) said: ‘An arrow or a whip is sufficient.’ Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) said: ‘I prefer it to be broader than that, because the words ‘even if it is an arrow’ indicate that something else is more appropriate than it’” (Al-Mughni, 2/38)\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about the size of the Sutrah for one who is praying.\xa0\nHe replied:\xa0\n“The best Sutrah that a person puts when he prays is the height of the back of a saddle, approximately two-thirds of a cubit, but if it is less than that, it does not matter; even if it is an arrow or a stick, it is acceptable."" (Majmu` Fatawa Ibn `Uthaymin, 13/326)\xa0\nStanding close to the Sutrah\xa0\nThe Sunnah is for the worshipper to stand close to his Sutrah, so that he can stop anyone who tries to walk in front of him , because of the report narrated by Abu Dawud (695) from Sahl ibn Abu Hathmah (may Allah be pleased with him) from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) who said: “When one of you prays facing a Sutrah, let him draw close to it lest satan interrupt his prayer.” (Classed as sound by Ibn `Abd Al-Barr in At-Tamhid (4/195); classed as authentic by An-Nawawi in Al-Majmu` (4/195) and by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud)\nThe scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) differed concerning the distance and from where it should be measured.\xa0\n\nSome of them said that the distance is three cubits from the feet of the one who is praying, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) prayed in the Ka`bah with three cubits between him and the wall. (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 506). This is the view of the Hanafis, Shafa`is and Hanbalis, and it is what is understood from the words of Malik, because the distance between the one who is praying and the Sutrah should be as much as he needs to stand, bow and prostrate. \xa0(See: Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah, 24/184)\nOthers were of the view that the distance should be sufficient to allow a sheep to pass, from the place where the worshipper prostrates, because of the report narrated by Al-Bukhari (474) and Muslim (508) from Sahl ibn Sa`d (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: Between the place where the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) prayed and the wall there was a space where a sheep could pass.\xa0\n\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“In the Hadith, Between the place where the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) prayed and the wall there was a space where a sheep could pass, what is meant by ‘the place where he prayed’ is the place where he prostrated. This indicates that the Sunnah is for the one who is praying to be close to his Sutrah.”\xa0\n\nSome scholars reconcile between the Hadith of Ibn `Umar and that of Sahl ibn Sa`d (may Allah be pleased with them both) by interpreting the Hadith of Ibn `Umar, which mentions three cubits, as applying when the worshipper is standing, and the Hadith of Sahl, which mentions a space where a sheep could pass, as applying when the worshipper is prostrating.”\xa0\n\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/145200/how-high-should-the-sutrah-be
464430,"If we did the marriage contract over the Internet, is it permissible to do it again in person after a few months have passed?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIf the marriage contract that was done over the Internet met all the necessary conditions, then it is a valid marriage. It is valid to do the marriage contract over the Internet so long as it meets all the necessary conditions. The senior scholars have issued fatwas stating that a marriage contract done over the telephone is valid, if we have verified the identity of the parties to the marriage contract and it fulfils the necessary conditions, namely the consent of the woman’s guardian (wali), two witnesses, and the proposal and acceptance. If a marriage contract done in this way is valid, then if it is done over the Internet, in which it is possible to verify the voice and the image directly, it is more appropriate that it should be valid.\nSee the fatwa of Shaykh Ibn Baz in question no. 2201 , and also question no. 297344 .\nSecondly:\nIf the first marriage contract met the necessary conditions, then repeating it a second time will not invalidate the first marriage contract; rather it is by way of confirming it in front of the family, or for the purpose of documenting the first marriage contract. So the rulings on marriage will apply from the time of the first contract. Hence it is not valid to impose new conditions in it, or to stipulate a mahr (dowry) other than that which was agreed upon in the first contract. But if the first marriage contract did not meet the necessary conditions, then it is deemed invalid and a new marriage contract must be done with a new mahr, and it is permissible to stipulate new conditions in it.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/464430/what-is-the-ruling-on-repeating-the-marriage-contract-if-it-was-done-over-the-internet
209517,How can a person fulfil his religious obligations of Wudu and prayer when his right arm is broken and is in a cast?,"['Praise be to Allah.How to make Wudu with a cast\xa0\nIf a person is unable to move his right arm and use it when doing acts of worship, then he must be careful to adhere to the following Shar`i rulings:\nWudu and Ghusl are obligatory and are not waived because of his right arm being broken , because he can use his left arm to take water and make it reach the parts of the body that must be washed when purifying himself. He must be careful and deliberate when doing that to ensure that the act of purification is done properly.\nWith regard to the right arm which is broken and in a cast , it is sufficient, when doing Wudu and Ghusl, to wipe over it lightly so that the plaster will not be affected, and it can be wiped once only and does not have to be done repeatedly, unlike washing the arm [as is usually done]. Thus the act of purification will be sound, in sha Allah. It is also essential to note that the fingers or elbow of the right hand, if they are uncovered, must be washed; wiping is only acceptable with regard to the part that is hidden beneath the cast.\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Sometimes the cast covers the palm and the fingers are not covered. In that case, it is obligatory to wash the fingers and the cast may be wiped over. Similarly, in the case of [a cast on] the leg , the toes may be not covered, so they must be washed and the cast must be wiped over.” (Al-Liqa’ Ash-Shahri, 61/27)\nHow to pray with a cast\nWith regard to prayer, the actions of the right arm may be summed up as follows:\n\nRaising the arm when saying the four Takbirs (when commencing the prayer (Takbirat Al-ihram), when bowing, when standing up from bowing, and when rising from the first Tashahhud).\nPlacing the right hand over the left hand when standing.\nResting on the arm when prostrating.\nPlacing the hands on the thighs when sitting.\nPointing with the forefinger when reciting the Tashahhud.\n\nIn all of these cases, if you can move the arm that is in plaster and do these actions if possible, then that is better and is preferable. If you are not able to complete the full movement with your arm, then you should do as much as you are able. If you are not able to move it, then there is no blame on you, and you only have to move the left arm when doing these actions, with the exception of pointing with the forefinger, which should be done only with the right hand.\nThe Shar`i evidence for all of the above is two general juristic principles, for which are proven by many religious texts of the Quran and authentic Sunnah.\n\nThe first principle: Hardship dictates leniency. The evidence for which is the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “Allah does not burden any soul with more than it can bear” [Al-Baqarah 2:286]\nThe second principle: What one is able to do cannot be waived on the grounds of what one is unable to do. The evidence for which is the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “So fear Allah as much as you are able.” [At-Taghabun 64:16] This is an important principle concerning which the scholars say: “It is one of the basic principles that cannot be overlooked so long as the principles of Shari`ah are adhered to.” (Al-Ashbah wan-Nadha’ir by As-Suyuti, p. 293)\n\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“There are many religious texts which indicate that the actions that are enjoined are subject to the condition that one be able to do them, as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to `Imran ibn Husayn: “Pray standing; if you cannot, then sitting; and if you cannot then lying on your side.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 1117)\nThe Muslims unanimously agreed that if a worshipper is unable to do some of the obligatory parts of the prayer – such as standing, sitting, bowing, prostrating, covering the `Awrah, facing the Qiblah, and so on – then what he is unable to do is waived in his case. Rather what he is obliged to do is that which, if he seriously wanted to do it, he could do it.\xa0\nIt is important to note that the Shar`i definition of one’s ability to comply with the commands and prohibitions is not the ability to do so even if it leads to harm. In fact if a person is able to do something but it would harm him , then he is regarded as being like one who is unable to do it in many instances, such as purifying himself with water, fasting when he is ill, standing in the prayer, and so on, in accordance with the words of Allah, may He be exalted (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Allah intends for you ease and does not intend for you hardship.”\xa0[Al-Baqarah 2:185]\n“[Allah] has not placed upon you in the religion any difficulty.”\xa0[Al-Hajj 22:78]\n“Allah does not intend to make difficulty for you.”\xa0[Al-Ma’idah 5:6]\nIn an authentic narration from Anas (may Allah be pleased with him), the Prophet (blessings and peace be upon him) said: “You have been sent to make things easy, and you have not been sent to make things difficult.” (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 8/438-439)\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/209517/how-to-make-wudu-with-a-cast
