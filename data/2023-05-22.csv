375425,"Our residental scholar in southern california couldn’t answer my question so Im writing to you. My question being I live in an area in the country which is extremely rural and there is no halal meat so I have decided to take up hunting. I don’t want to bother the neighbors with a loud firearm so have thus decided to go the route of a powerful BB-gun or air rifle as some call it. Anyways I wonder if a bb-gun is permissible to hunt with for the reason that the BBs or ammo typically used are round or blunted, not sharp or pointed, for the most part (though some do exist there still not all that sharp)? I ask all this because I want to know if I will have killed my game by “violet blow” if I use rounded blunted BBs? With BB guns since there much less powerful then real firearms the name of the game is head shots and taking shots no further then 30 yards from target. The bb gun Im getting is a .22 caliber, Im told its able to take down a fox by the airgun specialist, though I don’t know how humane a kill that would be regardless Typically with airguns you want to hunt small game like quail, squirrels, doves, and rabbits which is what Im hunting. All game thats permissible to hunt with a BB gun correct insh Allah?","['Praise be to Allah.It is stipulated that the weapon used for hunting should be sharp so that it creates a wound and has an impact on the flesh by cutting or piercing.\nThe pellets that are shot by an air rifle for hunting cut and penetrate the body, so it is valid to hunt with it.\nIt says in al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (28/133): We may sum up the conditions on hunting tools as follows:\nThe first condition:\nThe tool should be sharp so that it creates a wound and has an impact on the flesh by cutting or piercing, otherwise [the prey] is not permissible unless it is slaughtered in the manner prescribed in Islamic teachings.\nIt is not stipulated that the tool should be metal. Therefore it is valid to hunt with any sharp weapon, whether it is metal, wood sharpened to a point, stone knapped to create a sharp edge, or other materials that can penetrate the body.\nThe second condition:\nThe projectile should strike the prey with the sharp edge or point in order to wound it, and the hunter should be certain that death resulted from the wound, otherwise it is not permissible to eat it, because if it is killed by the blunt edge of the tool or by its weight, it is regarded as having been killed by a violent blow. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {Prohibited to you are dead animals, blood, the flesh of swine, and that which has been dedicated to other than Allah, and [those animals] killed by strangling or by a violent blow\xa0…} [al-Ma’idah 5:3]. And it was narrated that ‘Adiy ibn Hatim (may Allah be pleased with him) said to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): I shoot the game with a mi‘rad (a short, blunt, featherless arrow) and I hit it. He said: “If you shoot the mi‘rad and it pierces (the prey), then eat it, but if it strikes it with its edge, then do not eat it.” [Narrated by Muslim]. According to another version narrated by Muslim: the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If you shoot and mention the name of Allah, and it pierces the prey, then eat. But if it does not pierce it, do not eat it. And do not eat it if you strike it with the edge of the mi‘rad, unless you are able to slaughter it in the prescribed manner. And do not eat what is stuck with clay pellets, unless you are able to slaughter it in the prescribed manner. [Narrated by Ahmad]. And it was narrated that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade using small pebbles [for hunting], and he said: “They are not useful for hunting and are not effective in fighting the enemy, but they may break a tooth or put out an eye.” [Agreed upon].\nIt also says [in al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (28/135): Hunting with bunduq (bullets or pellets):\nThe Arabic word bunduq may mean several things, including what is eaten [hazelnuts] and what is made of balls of clay or lead that are shot at the prey when hunting.\nWhat is meant here is what is shot at the prey.\nWith regard to pellets made of clay, the jurists are unanimously agreed that what is killed by being shot with a heavy ball of clay is not permissible to eat, because it was killed by the weight of the projectile and not by its sharp point or edge…\nAl-Bujayrami said: Ibn ‘Abd as-Salam issued a fatwa stating that it is haram to shoot with clay pellets, and this is stated clearly in adh-Dhakha’ir. But an-Nawawi issued a fatwa stating that it is permissible, i.e., to shoot with clay pellets, but some of the scholars restricted it to cases where the prey does not usually die as a result, such as geese. But if the prey does die, as in the case of smaller birds, then it is haram. But if the pellets strike it and cut its neck with the force of the impact, or decapitate it, it is haram. This discussion is the correct view…\nAll of this applies to pellets made of clay or lead that are launched without combustion.\nAs for projectiles made of metal that are shot by firing a gun, the jurists differed concerning that. The Hanafis and Shafa‘is stated that it is haram…\nAd-Dardir, who was one of the Malikis, stated that it is permissible, as he said: As for lead, that which is shot with it may be eaten, because it is more powerful than other weapons, as is the view adopted by some scholars. Then ad-Dasuqi explained the matter further, as he said: To conclude, hunting with lead bullets is a matter concerning which there is no comment from the earlier scholars, because it is something that was introduced after the introduction of gunpowder in the middle of the last century.\nThe later scholars differed concerning that. Some of them said that it is not allowed, by analogy with clay balls, and others said that it is permissible, because it causes the blood to flow and kills quickly, as prescribed. Comparing lead bullets to clay balls is an invalid analogy, because there is a difference, which is that lead bullets pierce the skin and penetrate the body in a real sense, which is not the case with clay balls; rather all the latter do is cause pain and break bones. End quote.\nSee the answer to question no. 121239 which states that it is permissible to hunt with rifles.\nThere is no difference between a rifle that uses bullets and an air rifle, especially if what is hunted with it is small animals such as pigeons and rabbits.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/375425/ruling-on-hunting-with-air-rifle-pellets
269847,"I have a question regarding the Historical context of Surah Nisa, Ayat 34. I have gone through Tafsir Ibn Kathir and the Shades of the Quran by Sayid Qutubuddin but did not get any information regarding the historical context. Could you, therefore, kindly provide me the information When was Surah Nisa Ayat 34 revealed? Why was it revealed? In response to whose action was it revealed? I extemely grateful if you can help me in this regards.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Men are in charge of women because Allah has made one of them excel the other and because of what they spend [for maintenance] from their wealth. So righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in [the husband\'s] absence what Allah would have them guard. But those [wives] from whom you fear defiant disobedience - [first] advise them; [then if they persist], forsake them in bed; and [finally], strike them. But if they obey you [once more], seek no means against them. Indeed, Allah is ever Exalted and Great}\xa0[an-Nisa’ 4:34].\nThis affirms that the man is in charge of the woman and has the authority to discipline her if he fears defiant disobedience on her part.\nAllah, may He be exalted, mentions two reasons for the man being in charge of the woman, one of which is something that He has bestowed on the man, which is causing him to excel over the woman; and the other is what the man attains through his efforts, which is his spending and his wife.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{because Allah has made one of them excel the other and because of what they spend [for maintenance] from their wealth }\xa0[an-Nisa’ 4:34].\nAnd He, may He be glorified, has mentioned this qawamah [men being in charge of women] elsewhere, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And due to the wives is similar to what is expected of them, according to what is reasonable. But the men have a degree over them [in responsibility and authority]. And Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:228].\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his Tafsir (1/363): The words {But the men have a degree over them} mean: they are superior to them both physically and psychologically, in status and in obedience to Allah’s command, in spending and in taking care of various matters, and in the fact that they attain greater virtue in this world and the hereafter, as Allah, may He be exalted, says elsewhere:\n{Men are in charge of women because Allah has made one of them excel the other and because of what they spend [for maintenance] from their wealth}\xa0[an-Nisa’ 4:34]. End quote.\nHe also said: \xa0(1/635):\nThe words {Men are in charge of women} mean that the man is in charge of the woman; in other words, he is her leader and superior, and he has authority over her and is the one to discipline her if she drifts away.\n{because Allah has made one of them excel the other} that is, because men are superior to women and men are better than women. Hence prophethood was only granted to men, and the position of ruler or head of state is also only for men, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “No people will ever prosper who appoint a woman in charge of their affairs.” Narrated by al-Bukhari from ‘Abd ar-Rahman ibn Abi Bakrah, from his father. The same applies to the position of judge and other positions.\n{and what they spend [for maintenance] from their wealth} that includes dowries, maintenance and other spending that Allah has made obligatory for men to spend on women in His Book and the Sunnah of His Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Thus the man is inherently superior to the woman, and has an extra advantage over her because of what he spends on her maintenance. Therefore it is appropriate for him to be in charge of her, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {But the men have a degree over them [in responsibility and authority]…} [al-Baqarah 2:228].\n‘Ali ibn Abi Talhah narrated that Ibn ‘Abbas said: {Men are in charge of women} means that they are their leaders, so the woman must obey the man in what he instructs her to do. Obedience to him means that she should be kind to his family and take good care of his wealth. End quote.\nAl-Baydawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his Tafsir (2/184): {Men are in charge of women}, so there are to take care of them as rulers take care of their subjects.\nThe reason for that is twofold; it is because of what Allah has bestowed and because of the men’s efforts, as Allah says: {because Allah has made one of them excel the other}, because of the advantage that He, may He be exalted, has given to men over women, by granting them reason and wisdom, and greater physical strength to do good deeds and acts of worship. Hence certain things are granted only to men, such as prophethood, rulership, positions of authority, leading acts of worship, giving testimony in various legal cases, fighting in jihad, being obliged to attend Jumu‘ah prayers and the like, having a greater share of inheritance, and having the authority to issue divorce (talaq).\n{and what they spend [for maintenance] from their wealth} including what they spend on them when they marry them, such as the dowry and maintenance.\xa0End quote.\nAz-Zuhayli said: The man is in charge of the woman, meaning that he is her leader and superior, and he has authority over her and is the one to discipline her if she drifts away. He is the one who is in charge of her, so he protects her and takes care of her. It is he who must engage in jihad, not her, and he receives double her share of inheritance, because he is the one who is obliged to spend on her.\nThe reason why men are in charge is twofold:\nFirstly, the man has a physical advantage, because he is physically perfect, has strong powers of reasoning and the ability to understand things, is emotionally stable, and is physically sound. Therefore men excel women in reasoning, wisdom, resolve and strength; hence only men may be messengers, prophets, rulers and judges, and only men may carry out certain rituals such as the adhan, iqamah, khutbah, Jumu‘ah and jihad; only the man has the authority to issue divorce (talaq) and is permitted to marry multiple wives; only men may give testimony with regard to injuries and hadd punishments; and men receive a greater share of inheritance and may inherit as residual heirs [male relatives on the father’s side].\nSecondly, the man is obliged to spend on his wife and female relative, and he is obliged to pay the dowry, which is a gesture intended to honour the woman.\nApart from that, men and women are equal in terms of rights and duties. This is one of the beauties of Islam. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And due to the wives is similar to what is expected of them, according to what is reasonable. But the men have a degree over them [in responsibility and authority]}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:228].\nIn other words, men have a degree over them in managing the household and keeping an eye on the family’s affairs, guiding them and watching them.""(At-Tafsir al-Munir\xa0 5/54).\nSecondly:\nThere are da‘if (weak) hadiths one of which was narrated by at-Tabari (may Allah have mercy on him) in his Tafsir (8/291) from al-Hasan, according to which a man slapped his wife, so she came to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and he wanted to let her retaliate, but Allah revealed the words: {Men are in charge of women because Allah has made one of them excel the other and what they spend [for maintenance] from their wealth}. So the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) called the man and recited this verse to him, then he said: “I wanted one thing but Allah wanted something else.”\nThe isnad is sahih up to al-Hasan, but al-Hasan was a Tabi‘i, so the hadith is mursal, and mursal is a kind of da‘if (weak) hadith.\nMuqatil said: This verse was revealed regarding Sa‘d ibn ar-Rabi‘, who was one of the leaders of the Ansar. His wife was Habibah bint Zayd ibn Abi Hurayrah; they were both among the Ansar. She was defiantly disobedient towards him, so he slapped her…\nThirdly:\nWith regard to the context of the verse and how it is connected to the verses that come before it, Allah, may He be exalted, mentioned the reason why men are caused to excel over women, after stating the share of inheritance for each of them and forbidding both men and women to wish for that in which some of them have been caused to excel over others.""(At-Tafsir al-Munir ibn az-Zuhayli\xa0 5/45).\nThis is a reference to the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And do not wish for that by which Allah has made some of you exceed others. For men is a share of what they have earned, and for women is a share of what they have earned. And ask Allah of his bounty. Indeed Allah is ever, of all things, Knowing}\xa0[an-Nisa’ 4:32].\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/269847/what-is-meant-by-men-meant-being-in-charge-of-women-qawamah-and-the-reason-for-that
