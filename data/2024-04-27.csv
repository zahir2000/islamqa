405707,"Is constantly praying for forgiveness a means of receiving a response from Allah, may He be exalted, to a person’s supplication?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nBy His kindness and mercy, Allah, may He be exalted, answers people’s supplications, as He, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And your Lord says, “Call upon Me; I will respond to you.” Indeed, those who disdain My worship will enter Hell [rendered] contemptible}\xa0[Ghafir 40:60]\n{And [mention] Noah, when he called [to Allah] before [that time], so We responded to him and saved him and his family from the great flood}\xa0[Al-Anbiya’ 21:76]\n{And [mention] Job, when he called to his Lord, “Indeed, adversity has touched me, and you are the Most Merciful of the merciful.”\nSo We responded to him and removed what afflicted him of adversity. And We gave him [back] his family and the like thereof with them as mercy from Us and a reminder for the worshippers [of Allah]}\xa0[Al-Anbiya’ 21:83-84].\nIt was narrated from ‘Ubadah ibn as-Samit that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no Muslim on earth who calls upon Allah in supplication but Allah will grant it to him, or avert an equivalent evil from him, so long as his supplication does not involve sin or severing ties of kinship.” A man among the people said: Then I will offer a great deal of supplication. He said: “Allah will grant more.” Narrated by at-Tirmidhi (3573); he said: This hadith is hasan sahih, and gharib with this isnad.\nIt was narrated from Abu Sa‘id that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no Muslim who offers supplication in which there is no sin or severing ties of kinship, but Allah will grant him one of three things in response to it: either He will hasten for him what he asked for, or He will store it for him in the hereafter, or He will avert an equivalent evil from him.”\nThey said: Then we will offer a great deal of supplication. He said: “Allah will grant more.” Narrated by Imam Ahmad in al-Musnad (17/213). Shaykh al-Albani said: It is hasan sahih, as noted in Sahih at-Targhib wa’t-Tarhib (2/278).\nSecondly:\nThere are places and times in which a person is more likely to receive a response to his supplication. We have listed some of them in the answer to question no. 22438. They include:\n\nSupplication on Laylat al-Qadr.\nSupplication in the last part of the night.\nSupplication when in prostration.\nSupplication between the adhan and iqamah.\nSupplication at the time of the adhan for the prescribed prayers, and when the Muslim army engages the enemy in battle.\nSupplication of one who is oppressed.\nSupplication after the sun has passed the meridian, before Zuhr.\n\nThirdly:\nPrayer for forgiveness (istighfar) brings great benefits which it is good for the Muslim to learn about. In the Book of Allah, may He be exalted, Hud said to his people (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And O my people, ask forgiveness of your Lord and then repent to Him. He will send [rain from] the sky upon you in showers and increase you in strength [added] to your strength. And do not turn away, persisting in wickedness.\nO my people, seek the forgiveness of your Lord and repent to Him; He will send down upon you abundant rain from the sky, and will add strength to your strength. So do not turn away in sin}\xa0[Hud 11:52].\nAnd before him, Nuh said (interpretation of the meaning):\n{He will send [rain from] the sky upon you in [continuing] showers,\nAnd give you increase in wealth and children and provide for you gardens and provide for you rivers}\xa0[Nuh 71:11-12].\nWe have mentioned in the answers to questions no. 39775\xa0and 104919 the virtue and benefits of praying for forgiveness.\nPraying for forgiveness makes it more likely that the believer will receive a response to his supplication in several ways:\n1.. Praying for forgiveness erases sins, which makes a person closer to Allah, may He be exalted, and being close to Allah is one of the means of receiving a response to supplication.\nIbn al-Qayyim said: I said to Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) one day: One of the scholars was asked: Which is more beneficial to a person, glorifying Allah (tasbih) or praying for forgiveness (istighfar)? He said: If the garment is clean, then bukhur (incense) and rosewater are better for it, and if it is dirty, then soap and hot water are better for it. Then he (may Allah have mercy on him) said to me: What about if the garment is still dirty?""(Al-Wabil as-Sayyib\xa0 1/233).\n2.. Praying for forgiveness is one of the means of increasing provision, and supplication and the response to it are provision from Allah, may He be glorified and praised.\nIbn Taymiyah said: I would have an issue or a problem that I found difficult to find an answer to, so I would ask Allah, may He be exalted, for forgiveness one thousand times, or more or less, until I felt at ease and found an answer to the issue or problem that was on my mind.""(Al-‘Uqud ad-Duriyyah fi Manaqib Ibn Taymiyah\xa0 p. 10).\nFourthly:\nWhat supports the idea that praying a great deal for forgiveness is one of the means of receiving a response to one’s supplication is the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him):\n“The supplication of Dhun-Noon which he offered when he was in the belly of the fish: ‘La ilaha illa anta, subhanaka, inni kuntu min az-zalimin (There is no god worthy of worship except You; exalted are You. I have indeed done wrong’ [al-Anbiya’ 21:87]. No Muslim calls upon his Lord with it for anything but he will receive a response.”\nNarrated by Ahmad (1462) and al-Tirmidhi (3505).\nAl-Qurtubi said, commenting on the passage,\n{And [mention] the man of the fish, when he went off in anger and thought that We would not decree [anything] upon him. And he called out within the darknesses, “There is no god worthy of worship except You; exalted are You. I have indeed done wrong.”\nSo We responded to him and saved him from the distress. And thus do We save the believers}\xa0[Al-Anbiya’ 21:87-88]:\nIn this verse, Allah promises the one who calls upon Him in supplication that He will respond, as He responded to Dhu’n-Nun and that He will save him as He saved Dhu’n-Nun; that promise is { And thus do We save the believers }.""(Al-Jami‘ li Ahkam al-Qur’an\xa0 11/334).\nThat is because his supplication combines all types of Tawhid:\n\nAffirmation of the oneness of Allah, may He be blessed and exalted.\nDeclaring Him to be far above any injustice, because His justice and wisdom are perfect.\nAcknowledging his sin.\nObserving proper etiquette when asking, as he [Dhu’n-Nun] did not ask of Allah, may He be exalted, by means of a clear statement; rather he only hinted at his situation. End quote.\n\nSee: Sharh ad-Du‘a’ min al-Kitab wa’s-Sunnah (p. 81).\nFor more information, please see the answer\xa0to question\xa0no. 318430 .\nThis idea is also confirmed by what al-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) mentioned when he said: This verse and the verse in Surat Hud indicate that prayer for forgiveness is a means by which provision and rain may come down.\nAsh-Sha‘bi said: ‘Umar went out to pray for rain, and he did no more than pray for forgiveness before he came back, then it rained. They said: We did not see you pray for rain. He said: I have indeed prayed for rain by words which are the stirrers-up of rain. Then he recited the words (interpretation of the meaning):\n{ And said, ‘Ask forgiveness of your Lord. Indeed, He is ever a Perpetual Forgiver.\nHe will send [rain from] the sky upon you in [continuing] showers}\xa0[Nuh 71:10-11].\nAl-Awza‘i said: The people went out to pray for rain, and Bilal ibn Sa‘d stood up to address them. He praised and glorified Allah, then he said: O Allah, we have heard Your words (interpretation of the meaning) {There is not upon the doers of good any cause [for blame]} [at-Tawbah 9:91]. We admit our wrongdoing, and Your forgiveness is not for anyone except people like us. O Allah, forgive us, have mercy on us, and grant us rain. He raised his hands and the people raised their hands, then it rained.\nIbn Subayh said: A man complained to al-Hasan of drought, and he said to him: Ask Allah for forgiveness. Another man complained to him of poverty, and he said to him: Ask Allah for forgiveness. Another man said to him: Pray to Allah to bless me with a child. He said to him: Ask Allah for forgiveness. Another man complained to him that his garden was dry, and he said to him: Ask Allah for forgiveness. We asked him about that, and he said: I was not speaking of my own accord. Allah, may He be exalted, says in Surat Nuh (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Ask forgiveness of your Lord. Indeed, He is ever a Perpetual Forgiver.\nHe will send [rain from] the sky upon you in [continuing] showers\nAnd give you increase in wealth and children and provide for you gardens and provide for you rivers}\xa0[Nuh 71:10-12].\nAnd we have already seen in Surat Al ‘Imran how to seek forgiveness, and that that should be done with sincerity and giving up sins. This is the most important means of receiving a response.""(Tafsir al-Qurtubi\xa0 18/302-303).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/405707/impact-of-prayer-for-forgiveness-istighfar-on-receiving-a-response-to-supplication-dua
21662,Is it permissible for a worshipper to put his shoes in front of him as a Sutrah?,"['Praise be to Allah.What can be used as Sutrah?\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (May Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“It is permissible for a worshipper to use anything as a Sutrah [an object placed in front of him to “screen” him whilst he is praying], even if it is an arrow. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When any one of you prays, let him place a Sutrah for his prayer, even if it is an arrow.” (Narrated by Ahmad, 14916; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in As-Silsilah As-Sahihah, 2783)\xa0\nThe scholars even said:\xa0 “He can screen himself with a thread or the edge of the rug. Indeed it says in the Hadith that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said whoever cannot find a stick, let him draw a line, as it says in the Hadith of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When any one of you prays, let him face towards something, and if he cannot find anything, let him use a stick, and if he does not have a stick, let him draw a line, then it will not matter whatever passes in front of him .” (Narrated by Imam Ahmad. Ibn Hajar said in Bulugh Al-Maram: Those who said that this Hadith is inauthentic are incorrect; rather it is sound.”\xa0\nAll of this indicates that the Sutrah does not have to be big, rather it is sufficient for it to be something that indicates that it is serving as a screen.\xa0\nIs it permissible to put shoes as Sutrah?\nThere is no doubt that shoes are big and three dimensional, but I think that they should not be used as a Sutrah , because shoes are customarily regarded as dirty, and you should not have them in front of you, when you are standing before Allah . Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade worshippers to spit in front of them so that the sputum would be in front of them, and he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “For Allah is in front of him [the worshipper].” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 406) (Fatawa Ibn `Uthaymin, 13/326)\xa0\nFor more details, please refer to the following answers: 118153 , 13700 , 117758 , and 126664 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21662/can-you-pray-with-shoes-in-front-of-you-as-sutrah
216894,"I would like to ask you about something that is confusing to many women. Many women are wondering how a woman can be certain that she has become pure (that is, her menses has ended) by seeing dryness or the white discharge? The problem with that is that the woman may become pure, with dryness or the white discharge, without realising. That is because she may not be able to keep checking every little while to find out if her menses has ended, because she may be in a meeting or the like. It may be that nothing has happened, but perhaps her being pure because of dryness or the white discharge only lasted for a few minutes, then when she checks to find out whether her menses has ended or not, she sees yellowish or brownish discharge, so she does not know whether this brownish or yellowish discharge came after her menses had ended, as signalled by dryness or the white discharge, or it is part of her menses and she is still menstruating and did not become pure yet.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nA woman may work out whether she has become pure [that is, her menses has ended] by one of two signs: either emission of the white discharge, or complete dryness of that place.\nSecondly:\nA woman has a menstrual cycle that she is familiar with, and she can recognise menstrual blood, and when the period starts and ends.\nSo when the time for her period ends and the time for her becoming pure is close, she should check to see whether she has become pure before she goes to sleep, and at the times of the daily prayers. So she should check before she goes to sleep and at the time of each prayer, to see whether she has become pure or not. If she sees the signs of becoming pure that she recognises in her own case, then she has become pure, and if she does not see that, then she is still menstruating.\nIt says in Mawahib al-Jalil by al-Hattab al-Maliki (1/372):\nMalik said: A woman does not have to keep checking to see whether she has become pure at night and at dawn; rather she should check when she wants to sleep and when she wakes up for the dawn prayer. She should also check at the times of prayer… End quote.\nThe woman should not hasten until she sees the sign that she has become pure [and her menses has ended]. When she sees that, she should do ghusl and pray and fast.\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nBecoming pure from menses happens when there is no trace of blood. So if the woman cleans herself with a piece of cotton or the like, and sees no trace of blood on it, then she must do ghusl, even if she does not see the white discharge. As for the white discharge, it is a white fluid that happens to some women at the end of menses; some women see a white discharge, which is a sign that menses has ended, and some women do not see that. What matters is that it should be clean, so that if a woman wipes herself with a piece of cotton and the like and sees that it is clean, with no yellowish or brownish discharge, then she should do ghusl, \xa0even if she does not see the white discharge.""(Fatawa Nur ‘ala ad-Darb\xa0 5/411).\nIbn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe basic principle is that menses is ongoing until the woman is certain that she has become pure [and menses has ended]. The same applies to anything that already exists; the basic principle is that it still exists until there is certainty that it is no longer there.""(Jalasat Ramadaniyyah\xa0 5/17).\nThirdly:\nAllah has not imposed any hardship on people in religion and the rulings of Islam are easy, with no difficulty or hardship in them; rather they are all easy.\nSo at the time when her period is due to end, a woman only has to check herself before going to sleep and at the times of prayer. She does not have to check constantly whether she has become pure or not.\nUsually, if she is in a meeting or is busy with something, at the time of each prayer she goes to pray. So at those times she can check herself as described above.\nIf a woman makes a mistake in determining the time her period ended, based on what she thinks, she is not sinning, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {And there is no blame upon you for that in which you have erred but [only for] what your hearts intended} [al-Ahzab 33:5]. \xa0But if she thinks that she has become pure [and her period has ended], and she prays and fasts, then she realises that she is still menstruating, she must stop praying and fasting until her period ends, and she must make up any obligatory fasts that she did during those days, because it has become clear that they were not valid.\nIf she does not pray because she thinks that she has not become pure, then she realises that she was pure [not menstruating], then she must make up those prayers, to be on the safe side, but if she does not make them up, then there is no blame on her, in sha Allah.\nSee also the answer to question no. 45885 .\nDoubts and speculation carry no weight, so thinking that perhaps she became pure without realising is of no significance, because Allah does not burden any soul with more than it can bear.\nRegarding the questioner’s words, “perhaps her being pure only lasted for a few minutes, then when she checks to find out whether her menses has ended or not, she sees yellowish or brownish discharge, so she does not know whether this brownish or yellowish discharge was part of her menses or came after her menses had ended,”\nshe is being too hard on herself and there is no need for that. If we were to decide that there is the possibility of the woman becoming pure for five minutes only, then that would mean that she would have to check herself every five minutes to see whether her period had ended or not.\nFor more information, see the answer to question no. 201425 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/216894/how-can-she-know-that-her-menses-has-ended-as-that-may-happen-and-then-be-followed-by-yellowish-or-brownish-discharge-without-her-realising
11731,"In my dreams i have people chasing me, sometimes its members of my family, sometimes people i dont know.it may sound wierd but its true. in such dreams i tend to fly up into the sky 2 escape from them and have been successful in doing so.does this mean Allah takes my soul and makes it actually fly.and also recently i had a dream in which an unknown man was having intercourse with me.i was shocked 2 have such a dream, did Allah take my soul then or was it another trick by shatan.","['Praise be to Allah.What to do if you see unpleasant dreams?\nThese and similar unpleasant dreams come from the Shaytan. What is prescribed for the Muslim, if he sees a dream that he dislikes, is to spit drily to his left three times and to seek refuge with Allah from the Shaytan and from the evil of what he has seen, three times, and he should turn over onto his other side. Then it (his dream) will not harm him. And he should not tell anyone about it , because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The good dream comes from Allah and the bad dream comes from the Shaytan. So if any one of you sees a bad dream which frightens him, let him spit drily to his left and seek refuge with Allah from its evil , then it will not harm him.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, Bad’ Al-Khalq, 3049)\xa0\nDreaming of having sex in Islam\nIf a woman sees in a dream that someone is having intercourse with her, this is something natural, for women may experience erotic dreams just as men do. An erotic dream (or “wet dream ”) is when one imagines doing sexual acts in one’s dream.\xa0\nIt was narrated in a Hadith that Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “Umm Sulaym came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, Allah is not too shy to tell us the truth. Does a woman have to do Ghusl if she experiences an erotic dream ?’ The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘(Yes), if she sees some wetness.’” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, Al-`Ilm, 127).\xa0\nShaykh Al-Bassam (may Allah have mercy on him) said that the word ihtamalat (translated here as “she sees an erotic dream”) refers to whatever a sleeper may see in his dreams, and what it means here is if a woman sees in her dream what men see of images of intercourse and the like.\nIf a woman sees such things in her dream, then if something comes out of her as a result of that dream, she has to do Ghusl.\xa0 But if she simply sees a dream and nothing comes out of her, then she does not have to do Ghusl , because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “If she sees some wetness.” (See Tawdih Al-Ahkam, 1/297)\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11731/ruling-on-dreaming-of-having-sex-in-islam
