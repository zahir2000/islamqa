308208,"I wiped over see-through socks that had holes, thinking that it was permissible, because a long time ago I read a fatwa which said that it was permissible, and I prayed for a whole day like that. Then I researched the matter to make sure, and I read that what is most likely the case is that it is not permissible. Are my prayers valid?","['Praise be to Allah.Most of the scholars are of the view that it is not permissible to wipe over the socks unless they are thick and the foot or part of it cannot be seen through them.\nOthers are of the view that it is permissible to wipe over the socks even if they are thin. That was narrated from ‘Umar and ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with them), and was regarded as more correct by Shaykh al-Albani and Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on them).\nPlease see the answer to question no. 228222 .\nThere is no hadith from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to clarify this issue; rather it is a matter that is subject to ijtihad, and with regard to such matters, if the Muslim follows one of the two views based on a fatwa that he heard, then he finds out that the other view is more likely to be correct, then he should follow the other view, but the acts of worship that he did based on the first view are valid and he does not have to repeat them.\nAl-Hajawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said regarding one who realises that the qiblah is in a different direction from what he thought based on his own efforts to work it out:\nHe should pray facing the second direction, but he does not have to make up the prayers that he offered facing the first direction, which he thought was correct. End quote.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his commentary:\nThe words: “and he should pray facing the second direction and does not have to make up the prayers that he offered facing the first direction” mean: when he realises that he was mistaken, because he thought the first direction was correct, based on doing what was expected of him of trying to work it out, and whoever makes the effort that is expected of him does not have to repeat acts of worship that he did on that basis if he realizes that it was wrong, because if we say that he has to repeat those acts of worship, it would mean having to do each act of worship twice.\nSo if he prayed Zuhr facing towards the north, believing it to be the qiblah on the basis of his best efforts to work it out, then at ‘Asr time it became clear to him that the qiblah is towards the south, then he does not have to repeat Zuhr, because he offered that prayer based on what he thought was correct after doing what is enjoined of seeking to reach a conclusion (ijtihad), and the second ihtihad does not nullify acts of worship that were done on the basis of the first ijtihad.\nSimilarly, in issues of research, if a man develops a view on the grounds that this is what the texts indicate, then after further research and discussion he comes up with a view that is different from his first view, he does not have to undo a judgement, if he judged between people on the basis of his first view, and he does not have to undo his fatwa. So he does not have to go to the one to whom he gave a fatwa based on his first view and say: I gave you a fatwa, then I realised that that fatwa was wrong. That is because the first fatwa was based on ijtihad, so it cannot be rendered invalid by the second ijtihad.\nThe reason why we say that the first fatwa should not be undone is: as he thinks that he was mistaken in his first ijtihad, on the basis of which that fatwa was given, it is also possible that he could be mistaken in his second ijtihad. Perhaps the first one is the one that was correct, when he thought that the second one was correct. Hence the scholars said: ijtihad cannot be undone by further ijtihad.\nIt was narrated from ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) regarding the issue of al-himariyyah [a famous issue having to do with shares of inheritance, which is when the deceased leaves behind a husband, a mother, brothers through the mother and full brothers], that he ruled that the full brothers do not receive any share of inheritance. Then later on the same scenario happened again, and he ruled that they could be included. He was asked about that, and he said: That [the first ruling] was based on our ijtihad at the time, and this [the second ruling] is based on our ijtihad now. And he did not undo the first ruling.""(Al-Sharh al-Mumti‘\xa0 2/288).\nBased on that, your previous prayer is valid, because it was based on a fatwa issued by a scholar who thinks that is permissible.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/308208/he-wiped-over-see-through-socks-then-he-realised-that-that-is-not-permissible-what-should-he-do
197537,"I was wondering whether you could enlighten me further on the books of Allah (Subhana Wa Ta'ala). Were the books of Allah (Injil, Torah, Zabur) the exact words of Allah when they came down originally? I do not mean the books which Christians and Jews read now which have been altered. My question is again: were the books of Allah originally the exact words of God like the Quran is?","['Praise be to Allah.Articles of faith in Islam\nAllah, may He be ُxalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“The Messenger (Muhammad blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) believes in what has been sent down to him from his Lord, and (so do) the believers. Each one believes in Allah, His Angels, His Books , and His Messengers. They say, ‘We make no distinction between one another of His Messengers’” [Al-Baqarah 2:285].\xa0\nAl-Bukhari (50) and Muslim (9) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: One day the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) appeared before the people and Jibril came to him and said: O Messenger of Allah, what is faith? He said: “To believe in Allah, His angels, His Books, the meeting with Him, and His Messengers, and to believe in the resurrection hereafter.”\xa0\nThe Quran, the Torah, the Gospel and the Zabur are all among the Books of Allah that He sent down to His Messengers (blessings and peace of Allah be upon them), and it is obligatory to believe in them. Whoever disbelieves in any of them has disbelieved in Allah.\xa0\nAre the words of Allah created?\nNothing of the words of Allah is created. He, may He be Glorified, spoke the Torah, the Gospel , the Quran and the Zabur in a real sense.\xa0\nSimilarly, not a single letter of the Quran is created. It is all the words of Allah in a real sense. The same is also true of the Torah, the Gospel and the Zabur. We do not differentiate between the Messengers of Allah, and we do not differentiate between the revealed Books; all of them are the words of Allah.\xa0\nAllah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Do you (faithful believers) covet that they will believe in your religion in spite of the fact that a party of them (Jewish rabbis) used to hear the Word of Allah (Torah), then they used to change it knowingly after they understood it?”\xa0[Al-Baqarah 2:75]\nWhat they used to distort is the Torah , but here Allah, may He be Exalted, calls it the “Word of Allah”.\xa0\nMuslim (2652) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Adam and Musa debated. Musa said: O Adam, you are our father but you caused our doom and caused us to be expelled from Paradise. Adam said to him: You are Musa, Allah chose you to speak to and wrote (the Torah) for you with His own hand. Are you blaming me for something that Allah decreed for me forty years before He created me?” The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Adam got the better of Musa, Adam got the better of Musa.”\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“The view of the early generations, the Companions and those who followed them in truth, and all the leading scholars of the Muslims, such as the four Imams and others, is that which is indicated by the Quran and Sunnah, which is what is in accordance with the clear rational evidence: that the Quran is the word of Allah that was revealed and not created; it comes from Him and will return to Him. He is the One Who spoke the Quran, the Torah and the Gospel, and other words; they are not created and separate from Him. He, may He be Glorified, speaks by His will and power, and His word is within His Essence, and is not a creation separate from Him […] The words of Allah have no end, as Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “Say (O Muhammad blessings and peace of Allah be upon him to mankind): ‘If the sea were ink for (writing) the Words of my Lord, surely, the sea would be exhausted before the Words of my Lord would be finished, even if we brought (another sea) like it for its aid’” [Al-Kahf 18:109].\xa0\nAllah, may He be Glorified, spoke the Quran in Arabic and the Torah in Hebrew […]\xa0Whoever regards His words as created must say: Is that which is created the One Who spoke to Musa: “Verily! I am Allah! La ilaha illa Ana (none has the right to be worshipped but I), so worship Me, and perform As-Salat (Iqamat As-Salat) for My Remembrance” [Ta-Ha 20:14]. This is impossible; these cannot be anything other than the words of the Lord of the Worlds. As Allah spoke the Quran, the Torah, and other Scriptures, with their meanings and words which consist of letters, none of that is created; rather that is the words of the Lord of the Worlds.” (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 12/37-41) (See also: Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 12/355-356)\xa0\nShaykh Mustafa Ar-Ruhaybani (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Swearing by the words of Allah, may He be Exalted, or the Quran, or a surah or verse thereof, is a (valid) oath, because it is one of His attributes. So whoever swears by it or by any part of it has sworn an oath by one of the attributes of Allah, may He be Exalted.\xa0\nThe same applies to swearing by the Torah or any of the other Books of Allah, may He be exalted, such as the Gospel and the Zabur. This is an oath for which expiation is required (if it is broken), because an oath sworn by the Torah or Gospel in general terms is swearing by that which was sent down from Allah, may He be Exalted, not that which has been changed or altered, and the sanctity thereof is not waived by the fact that it has been abrogated by the rulings of the Quran, as is similar to the case of some verses in the Quran the rulings of which were abrogated. That does not alter the fact that it is the words of Allah, may He be Exalted, and as it is His words, it is one of His attributes, as is the Quran.""

324533,"What is the ruling on wearing socks that are somewhat short if they were put on after doing wudu’, then when doing wudu’ again, I pull them up so that they cover the ankles and wipe over them?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nWhat is stipulated in order for it to be permissible to wipe over the socks\nIt is permissible to wipe over the khuffs and socks subject to certain conditions, one of which is that the socks must cover the place that must be washed when doing wudu. In other words, the socks must cover the feet and ankles, and it is not permissible to wipe over socks which come below the ankles.\nThe majority of scholars disallowed wiping over socks, but the Hanbalis permitted it if the conditions regarding the khuffs are met, one of which is that they must cover the ankles.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Mughni (1/214): It is not permissible to wipe over anything except the khuffs and anything that takes their place that is cut down, and the like, that comes above the ankles.\nWhat this means – and Allah knows best – is that the ruling on the khuffs also applies to that which takes the place of the khuffs and covers what must be washed when doing wudu, if it is possible to walk in it and it stays put by itself. That which has been cut down is the short khuff; it is only permissible to wipe over it if it covers the place that must be washed and the ankles cannot be seen, because it is tight or wrapped. This is the view of al-Shafa‘i and Abu Thawr.\nBut if it is cut so short that it comes below the ankles, it is not permissible to wipe over it. This is the correct view, narrated from Malik. It was narrated from him and from al-Awza‘i that it is permissible to wipe over it. End quote.\nIt says in Kashshaf al-Qina‘ (1/115): It is not valid to wipe over anything except that which covers the area that must be washed, which is the entire foot, otherwise it would mean that what is covered is to be wiped and what is not covered is to be washed, and there is no way to do both; therefore the entire foot [including the ankles] must be washed, because that is the basic principle. End quote.\nIbn Hazm disagreed, and said that it is permissible to wipe over [the khuff] that comes below the ankles.\nPlease see the answer to question no. 176866 .\nSecondly:\nThe ruling on socks that slip below the ankles after being wiped over\nIf you wiped over the socks when they were covering the ankles, it is valid to wipe over them. But if they slipped down below the ankles after that, doing wudu by wiping over them is not valid and your current wudu is invalidated according to the Hanbalis, who say that it is permissible to wipe over the socks.\nWhat is meant by it not being valid to do wudu by wiping over them is that it is not permissible for you to wipe over them again, until after you have done wudu in full, which includes washing your feet.\nSome of the scholars are of the view that you cannot do wudu again by wiping over the socks, but the current wudu that you did before the socks slipped down below the ankles is still valid.\nIt says in Zad al-Ma‘ad: If any part of the place that must be washed becomes exposed after wudu was invalidated or the period during which wiping over the socks is allowed expires, then the individual must do wudu all over again [which includes washing the feet].\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) favoured the view that wudu is not invalidated [if the khuffs or socks slip below the ankle), and this was regarded as more likely to be correct by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin. See: ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘ (1/264).\nIf you can no longer wipe over your socks when you do wudu because the socks have slipped below the ankles, then you will not be able to avail yourself of this concession which allows wiping over the socks. Based on that, if you want to avail yourself of this concession, then you should choose long socks that cover the ankles and will stay up, and will not drop down to the part that must be washed when doing wudu.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/324533/ruling-on-wiping-over-short-socks-if-he-pulled-them-up-above-the-ankles-and-wiped-over-them-then-they-slipped-below-the-ankles
240518,"I want to know how I can distinguish between makeup that prevents water from reaching the skin when doing Wudu and that which does not have that effect. I know that anything which forms a layer, such as nail polish for example, prevents water from reaching the skin, but there are cosmetic preparations that do not form a layer; rather they are oily to a large extent, such as lipstick and foundation cream. Do these prevent water from reaching the skin? Does everything that is waterproof – and these types cannot be removed by water only except with difficulty – prevent water reaching the skin when doing Wudu, as I have read in some chat rooms? Do powders not prevent water from reaching the skin, such as powders used on the cheeks and eyeshadow? Is there a practical way to distinguish between the two types?","['Praise be to Allah.Water must reach the skin in Wudu\nIt is essential that the water reaches all the parts of the body that are to be washed when doing Wudu . The evidence for that from the Sunnah includes the following:\nIt was narrated from Khalid ibn Ma`dan (may Allah have mercy on him), from one of the Companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) saw a man praying, and on the back of his foot there was a spot the size of a Dirham that the water had not reached, so the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed him to repeat his Wudu and his prayer. (Narrated by Abu Dawud (175); classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Irwa’ Al-Ghalil (1/127)\nThe four Schools of Fiqh agreed that in order for Wudu to be valid , it is essential to remove anything that may prevent the water from reaching the parts of the body that must be washed. (See: Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah, 43/329)\nWhat are the substances that prevent water from reaching the skin?\xa0\nThe definition of the substances that prevent water from reaching the skin is based on real-life observation. The scholars pondered this matter, and concluded that substances are of two types:\n\nSubstances that have “mass”, i.e., they remain in the form of a layer, so when they are placed on the body they remain as they are, forming an integral mass, and can be removed by peeling or wiping.\n\nExamples of that include waxy substances and paint. With regard to substances that have mass:\n\nEither they are not waterproof, such as some types of makeup and powder . In this case, when doing Wudu, it is sufficient to rub the skin well, until it is thought most likely that the water has reached the skin.\n\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“With regard to rubbing the body when doing Ghusl or rubbing the parts of the body that must be washed when doing Wudu, that is obligatory if it is not known for certain whether the water will reach where it should without rubbing it, as in the case of inner layers of thick hair. But if water may reach where it should without rubbing it, rubbing it is encouraged […] By means of rubbing, proper cleansing is achieved, and one may be certain of having made the water reach everywhere it should, which is obligatory. Hence it is prescribed, as in the case of rubbing between the fingers when doing Wudu."" (Sharh `Umdat Al-Fiqh\xa0 1/367-368)\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“What is required when doing Wudu and Ghusl is to make sure water reaches every part of the body that must be purified. As for rubbing it, that is not obligatory, but it may be essential when there is a need for it, such as if the water is very cold, or if there are traces of oil, paint and the like on that part of the body. In that case, it is essential to rub it, so as to be certain that the water has reached all the parts of the body that are to be purified."" (Fatawa Nur `Ala Ad-Darb\xa0 3/94)\n\nOr that substance may be waterproof, as in the case of some kinds of makeup. In that case it must be removed before doing Wudu, so as to ensure that the water will reach the skin when doing Wudu.\n\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Our companions said: If he puts fat or wax or dough on the cracks of his feet, or puts henna on them, and the “mass” or substance of that remains there, he must remove it, because it prevents the water from reaching the skin."" (Al-Majmu`\xa0 1/426)\n2. Substances that have no “mass”, i.e., they do not form a layer; rather when they are placed on the body, they are\xa0absorbed by the skin. Nothing is left of them; rather they may leave a trace such as colour, for example.\nExamples include most creams and oils, traces of kohl and henna, and so on. The presence of the substance does not invalidate Wudu, but if the substance is fatty or oily, then the one who is purifying himself must rub the skin well, until he thinks it most likely that the water has reached it.\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“But if the oil does not have any “mass”, and only leaves a trace on the parts of the body that are to be washed, then that does not matter. But in this case, it is essential for the individual to pass his hand over that area, because usually the oil repels water, so perhaps it may not reach all of the part that he is washing.""

247586,I have a health social worker who helps with the family's health and other needs.,"['Praise be to Allah.Is it forbidden to help others in sin?\xa0\nIt is forbidden to help others in sin, because Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Help you one another in virtue, righteousness and piety; but do not help one another in sin and transgression. And fear Allah. Verily, Allah is Severe in punishment”\xa0[Al-Ma’idah 5:2]\nAdditionally, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever calls people to guidance will have a reward like that of those who follow him, without that detracting from their reward in the slightest, and whoever calls people to misguidance will have a burden of sin like that of those who follow him, without that detracting from their burden of sin in the slightest.” (Narrated by Muslim, 4831)\nThere are other texts which prove that the one who helps someone else in sin is also sinning , such as the text which curses the one who records Riba and the two who witness it, and the curse on the one who carries alcohol (to someone who will drink it) and on the one who presses (the grapes etc with which it is made), and so on.\nNonetheless, not every kind of help is prohibited; rather what is prohibited is deliberate help in which the one who offers it intends to help the person in his sin, or direct help such as carrying alcohol or writing down contracts involving Riba.\nWith regard to indirect help, when one does not deliberately intend to help in sin, this is not prohibited; if it were to be prohibited, it would cause a great deal of hardship to people.\nFor example, it is confirmed that it is permissible to interact with the disbelievers in terms of buying, selling, lending, borrowing, and holding items in pledge, as is indicated by the authentic Sunnah, even though this involves indirectly helping them (in sin), because it is benefitting the disbeliever in financial terms, and enabling him to use that wealth in prohibited things such as Riba and the like, yet despite that Islamic teaching overlooks this kind of helping.\nCategories of helping in sin and transgression\nDr Walid Al-Minisi, a member of the Council of Islamic Jurists in America, said:\n“The issue of guidelines on helping in sin and transgression was the subject of a lengthy discussion and debate among the members of the Council of Islamic Jurists in America, in its fifth session held in Bahrain in 1428 AH.\nTo sum up the conclusion they reached: helping in sin and transgression falls into four categories:\n\nDirect and intentional help, such as someone who gives alcohol to another person with the intention of helping him to drink it.\nUnintentional, such as selling prohibited things that have a permissible use, if there is no intention to help them in using them in prohibited ways.\nIntentional but indirect, such as someone who gives another person money with which to buy alcohol. Indirect manslaughter is also included in this category .\nIndirect and unintentional, such as someone who sells things that may be used for lawful or unlawful purposes, and does not intend to help those who use them for unlawful purposes, such as someone who gives another person money not for the purpose of buying alcohol. If he buys alcohol with it and drinks it, there is no sin on the one who gave him the money, so long as he did not intend to help him with something unlawful.\n\nThis fourth category also includes buying and selling and renting from polytheists and Muslims who are evildoers, and giving money to them in charity.\nThe decision of the council was that the first three types are prohibited and the fourth type is permissible, which is the one that is not direct and not intentional.”\nAn exception is made from the fourth category in cases where it is known or thought most likely that the person who is helped will use it for sinful purposes. For this reason many of the jurists prohibited the sale of grapes to someone who will press them for wine, and the sale of weapons during times of turmoil, even though grapes and weapons may be used for both lawful and unlawful purposes.\nTherefore Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Every garment that he thinks will most likely be used for sinful purposes, it is not permissible to sell it to or sew it for one who will use it for sinful and wrong purposes. … The same applies to everything that is basically permissible, when it is known that it will be used for sinful purposes.” (Sharh Al-‘Umdah, 4/386)\nGoing back to your question, it seems that offering direct help to this employee would mean someone taking him there in his car, or buying him a ticket of admittance, and the like.\nAs for simply allowing him to park his car, this is indirect help, and there is not necessarily any connection between that and the sin; he may not go to the match, or he may go but not commit any unlawful action, such as looking at ‘Awrahs or mixing (with women) in a prohibited way. In principle, it is essential to differentiate between going to commit sin and going to do something permissible that may be accompanied by something sinful, as the jurists differentiated between someone who rents out his house to be used for sinful purposes, such as making it into a tavern, and someone who rents out his house for permissible accommodation, but alcohol is drunk in it. The former kind of renting is prohibited but not the latter.\nUndoubtedly, differentiating between direct and indirect help will vary from one issue to another. So the scholar should try to examine the case, with reference to what the jurists have mentioned about similar cases.\nTo sum up: letting this employee park his car in your driveway is not directly helping him in sinful actions such as looking at ‘Awrahs or listening to music, and other evils that are present in the stadium; rather it is helping him and comes under the same heading as helping him by selling food, drink and clothing to him. That is not prohibited on the grounds that it may help him to remain strong and healthy and enable him to commit unlawful actions, because that is indirect and unintentional help, therefore Islamic teaching overlooks it and permits us to buy and sell and engage in commercial transactions with the disbelievers, as mentioned above.\nAssisting someone take an admission exam using your laptop for loan-financed studies\nThere is nothing wrong with allowing your relative to take the acceptance test for admission to his studies using your laptop, even if he is going to pay for his studies with an interest-based loan . That is because studying is permissible, and you are only helping him with that, not with the loan.\nRather it is forbidden for him to use your computer to get this unlawful loan , because that comes under the heading of helping him with that sin.\nYou should understand that whoever takes out an interest-based loan, despite the fact that it is sinful, takes possession of the money that he borrows and it is permissible for him to make use of it with regard to his food, drink, accommodation, studies and other things, and he does not have to get rid of any of these things. So there is nothing wrong with you helping this relative and others with regard to permissible studies.\nCan you stipulate late payment fees in case of interest-free loans?\nInterest-free loans are prohibited if it is stipulated that a penalty be paid in the event of late repayment , because this comes under the heading of approving of Riba, along with the possibility of actually falling into Riba.\nIt says in a statement of the Islamic Fiqh Council belonging to the Muslim World League in Makkah, issued during its eleventh session, statement no 8:\n“If the lender stipulates that the borrower has to pay a sum of money as a financial penalty of a fixed amount or a specific percentage, if there is any delay in repayment beyond the time agreed upon by both, then this is an invalid condition, and he is not required to fulfil it; indeed it is not permissible, regardless of whether the one who stipulated it was the bank or anyone else, because this in and of itself is the Riba of the pre-Islamic era that the Quran forbids.”\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/247586/is-assisting-in-sin-a-sin
