475245,"If a worker takes a loan from the boss or the company, is it permissible to agree to cancel the debt and give the employee a lower wage for a while?","['Praise be to Allah.If the employee takes a loan from his work, and there is an agreement that it will be paid back through deductions from his salary, then there are two forms of this agreement, one of which is permissible and the other is not allowed.\nThe first form:\nThis is when the deduction from the salary is equal to what you owe or less than that, then the salary will go back to normal [after the debt has been paid off]. This is permissible, and it may be worked out on the basis of the remaining time of the contract, or by agreeing on the time period within which deductions will be made from the salary. This is one way of paying off the loan if it is done with the consent of both parties.\nIt is as if you are giving permission to the company to deduct something from your salary that you earn as instalments towards paying off the debt. There is nothing wrong with this.\nThe second form:\nThis is when the deduction that is taken from your salary will add up to more than the amount of the debt. This is not permissible, because it becomes a loan that brings a benefit. So it is as if the company loaned you ten thousand, for example, then takes back more than that through deductions from your salary.\nIt is not permissible for the lender to ask for or accept any material or intangible privileges or benefits, or to accept any such thing from the borrower, either before giving the loan or during the period of the loan (before the debt is paid off).\nIt was narrated that Abu Burdah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I came to Madinah and met ‘Abdullah ibn Salaam (may Allah be pleased with him), who said to me: You live in a land where dealing with riba is widespread. If someone owes you something and he gives you a load of hay, or a load of barley, or a load of fodder for free, do not accept it, for it is riba. Narrated by al-Bukhari (3603).\nIbn al-Mundhir said: The scholars were unanimously agreed that in the case of giving a loan, if the lender stipulates that he wants a gift worth one tenth of the loan or more, and he gives the loan on that basis, his taking of the extra amount is riba. End quote from al-Ijma‘ by Ibn al-Mundhir (p. 99).\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It was narrated from more than one of the prominent Sahabah – such as Ubayy, Ibn Mas‘ud, ‘Abdullah ibn Salaam, Ibn ‘Umar and Ibn ‘Abbas – that they forbade the lender to accept any gifts from the borrower, and they regarded accepting it as riba.""(I‘lam al-Muwaqqi‘in\xa04/66).\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said, regarding giving a gift to the lender: If the borrower does that without prior stipulation before paying off the debt, the lender should not accept it, and it is not permissible to accept it unless he gives him a gift in return, or counts it as part of payment for the loan, unless they had the habit of exchanging gifts before the loan. That is because of the report narrated by al-Athram, according to which a man was owed twenty dirhams by a fisherman, who started to give him fish and estimate their value, then when the total reached thirteen dirhams, he asked Ibn ‘Abbas about that, and he said [to the fisherman]: Give him seven dirhams.""(Al-Mughni\xa0\xa06/437).\nAnother issue to pay attention to is if the period for reduction of the salary is unknown, or that reduction is permanent; in that case, this is not permissible, because it is a kind of gambling, which is haram. That is because he may have taken the loan in return for a reduction in his salary, or for giving up his salary for an unknown period, or permanently, and his salary during that period may add up to more than the loan that he took, in which case he will have lost more than what he owed, or it may add up to less than that, in which case he will have gained by not paying the full amount of the debt he owed. This is what gambling is, and it is haram.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/475245/is-it-permissible-to-deduct-something-from-an-employees-salary-towards-paying-off-a-debt-that-he-owes
12368,"How can we reconcile between the fact that doctors can find out whether the foetus is male or female, and the verse (interpretation of the meaning): “and [He] knows that which is in the wombs” [Luqman 31:24], and what was narrated in Tafsir Ibn Jareer from Mujahid, that a man asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) what his wife would give birth to, and Allah revealed this verse, and what was narrated from Qatadah (may Allah have mercy on him)? Is there any verse or hadith to make the general meaning of this verse (“what is in the wombs”) more specific?","['Praise be to Allah.Is there any contradiction between an unambiguous statement of the Quran and reality?\nBefore I discuss this matter, I would like to explain that there can never be any contradiction between an unambiguous statement of the Quran and reality. If there appears to be a contradiction with reality, it is either because what we think is reality is a baseless claim, or the (text of) the Quran is not opposed to this reality in a clear and definite manner. The unambiguous statements of the Quran and the facts of reality are both definitive, and two definitive things can never contradict one another.\xa0\nIs gender reveal allowed in Islam?\nBased on the above, it may be said that now they (doctors) are able, through the use of precise machines, to discover what is in the wombs and to find out whether it is male or female . If what is said is false, then there is no point in discussing it. If it is true, then it does not contradict the verse, because the verse is referring to a matter of the unseen, which has to do with the knowledge of Allah about these five matters .\xa0\nThe matters of the unseen as far as the foetus are concerned are: how long he will remain in his mother’s womb, his life, his deeds, his provision, whether he is doomed (destined for Hell) or blessed (destined for Paradise), and – before it is fully formed – whether it will be male or female. But after it has been fully formed, knowledge of whether it is male or female is no longer the matter of the unseen , because once it has been fully formed it becomes the matter of the visible world, but it remains within the three layers of darkness which, if they were removed, it would be known what it is. It is not far-fetched to think that among the things that Allah has created are powerful rays which can penetrate these layers of darkness so that it may become clear whether the foetus is male or female. The verse does not clearly refer to knowledge of whether the foetus is male or female, and the Sunnah does not refer to that either.\xa0\nIs Gender Reveal Part of the Unseen?\nWith regard to what the questioner refers to, that Ibn Jarir (may Allah have mercy on him) quoted from Mujahid (may Allah have mercy on him) that a man asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) what his wife would give birth to, and Allah revealed this verse, this narration is interrupted, because Mujahid (may Allah have mercy on him) was one of the Tabi`in [the generation after the Companions].\xa0\nThe Tafsir of Qatadah (may Allah have mercy on him) may be interpreted as meaning that Allah Alone has knowledge of that so long as it has not yet been fully formed. But once the foetus is fully formed, then others may have knowledge of it.\xa0\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his Tafsir of the verse from Surah Luqman (interpretation of the meaning): “No one knows what Allah wants to create in the wombs apart from Him, but once He decrees that it should be male or female, doomed or blessed, the angels who are appointed in charge of it know that, and whoever else He wills among His creation.”\xa0\nWith regard to your question about what may make the general meaning of this verse (“what is in the wombs”) more specific, we say that if the verse was speaking about being male or female after the foetus is fully formed, then that which would make it more specific would be tangible facts. The scholars have mentioned the principles of making the general meanings of the Quran and Sunnah more specific, which are a text, Ijma` (scholarly consensus), Qiyas (analogy), tangible facts or reason. Their comments on this matter are well known.\xa0\nBut since the verse does not refer to after the foetus is fully formed, but rather it refers to before that time, there is nothing in it that would contradict the idea of knowing whether the foetus is male or female.\xa0\nHow to interpret things that happen which outwardly appear to contradict the Quran\nPraise be to Allah, there is not, and never will be, anything in reality that contradicts the unambiguous statements of the Quran . The accusations made by the enemies of the Muslims against the Quran, that things happen which outwardly appear to contradict the Quran , arise from their misunderstanding of the Book of Allah which stems from their bad intentions. But the committed Muslims and scholars have enough knowledge to discover the truth which will refute the specious arguments of these people. Praise and blessings be to Allah.\xa0\nWith regard to this matter, people may be one of two extremes, or a middle group.\xa0\n\nOne extreme is to adhere to the apparent meaning of Quranic verses which are not unambiguous, and to reject any certain facts that go against it. Such people either expose themselves to criticism, or they expose the Quran to criticism, because their view contradicts the certain realities of everyday life.\xa0\nThe other extreme is to turn away from that which is indicated by the Quran and to adopt a purely materialistic approach. Thus one becomes a heretic.\xa0\nThe middle path is to accept both the indications of the Quran and the facts of reality. These people know that both of them are true, and that the unambiguous statements of the Quran cannot contradict something that is well known and visible. They combine acceptance of the transmitted texts with reason, thus keeping their religious commitment and their intellect safe and sound. Allah guides those who believe to the truth of that wherein they differ, and Allah guides whom He wills to a Straight Path (cf. Al-Baqarah 2:213).\xa0\n\nMay Allah help our believing brothers to achieve that, and may He cause us to be guided and to guide others, and make us righteous leaders. My strength is only in Allah, in Him I put my trust and to Him I turn in repentance.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12368/is-gender-reveal-part-of-the-unseen
131473,"My grandfather died before his father [my great-grandfather], and my grandfather’s sons, including my father and my paternal uncles, did not inherit anything from their grandfather. The sons of my great-grandfather inherited, and when we asked them to give us some of the inheritance, or we asked why we did not receive anything of the estate, they said: Your grandfather died before his father, therefore you do not inherit. Furthermore, they said that for us to inherit, all the sons of my great-grandfather must have died, but in fact they are still alive. My question is: is their argument sound? Is it true that we cannot inherit according to Islamic shari‘ah?","['Praise be to Allah.One of the conditions of inheritance is that the designated heir must be alive after the death of the testator [the one who leaves an estate behind], hence your father and paternal uncles would have inherited from their father if he died during their lifetime and left wealth to be inherited.\nBut as the great-grandfather has died, his living heirs – who are his children – inherit from him, and the children of his deceased son cannot inherit, because they are prevented from doing so in this case.\nThe guideline is that in the case of inheritance, if there is a son or sons, and also grandsons, the grandsons are prevented from inheriting by the presence of their paternal uncles, and they do not inherit anything.\nBased on that, what you were told is true, so there is no share of inheritance for your father and paternal uncles from your great-grandfather, so long as he has sons who are still alive.\nShaykh ‘Abdullah ibn Jibreen (may Allah preserve him) was asked: Can grandsons inherit from their grandfather, if their father died before their grandfather? If the answer is no, why is that?\nHe replied: In this context, grandsons refers to sons of sons, not sons of daughters. If their father dies before his father [their grandfather], they do not inherit from their grandfather if he leaves behind a son or sons, because the son is closer [to the deceased] then the son’s son. If the grandfather leaves behind no sons, not even one, and he only leaves behind daughters, then the grandsons receive what is left after the daughters are given their shares of inheritance. Similarly, the grandchildren may inherit from their grandfather, if he left behind no sons and no daughters, because they take the place of his own children, so each male will receive the share of two females.""(Majallat al-Haras al-Watani (issue no. 264, 1/6/2004).\nBut these grandchildren may still receive something from their grandfather’s estate in two ways:\nThe first way is if the grandfather made a bequest to them before he died, bequeathing one third or less of his estate. He may do this if he has a great deal of wealth, and this bequest is obligatory to some of the scholars and recommended (mustahabb) according to many of them.\nThe evidence for that is the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Prescribed for you when death approaches [any] one of you if he leaves wealth [is that he should make] a bequest for the parents and near relatives according to what is acceptable - a duty upon the righteous}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:180].\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: What we learn from this verse is that it is obligatory to make a bequest for parents and near relatives, for one who is leaving behind a lot of wealth, because Allah, may He be exalted, says: {Prescribed for you}. The scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) differed as to whether this was abrogated by the verses on inheritance or it is still applicable, as the verses on inheritance are more specific. There are two views, and most of the scholars are of the view that it is abrogated, but the more correct view is it has not been abrogated, because it may be understood as specifying. Hence it may be said that the words {for the parents and near relatives} apply specifically to cases where they have an allocated share, meaning that if they have an allocated share, no bequest can be made to them, because what Allah has allocated to them of inheritance is sufficient. Thus the verse remains general in meaning and refers to those other than the heirs who have been given allocated shares.\nWe also learn that it is permissible for the individual to make a bequest of whatever he wants, but this is restricted by the hadith of Sa‘d ibn Abi Waqqas (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which he said to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): Can I give two thirds of my wealth [as a bequest]? He said: “No.” He said: One half? He said: “No.” He said: One third? He said: “One third, and one third is still a lot.” Agreed upon. Based on this, the bequest should not be greater than one third of the wealth, so the verse is restricted by the hadith.\nWe also learn that the obligation to make a bequest only applies in the case of one who is leaving behind a great deal of wealth, because Allah, may He be exalted, says: {if he leaves wealth}. As for one who is leaving behind a small amount of wealth, it is best for him not to make bequests if he has heirs, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to Sa‘d ibn Abi Waqqaas (may Allah be pleased with him): “If you leave your heirs independent of means, that is better than leaving them dependent and asking of people.” Agreed upon.""(Tafsir Surat al-Baqarah\xa02/306).\nThe second way is for the paternal uncles to give them something of their shares of inheritance as a gift, to be distributed to them.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/131473/grandchildren-do-not-inherit-from-their-grandfather-if-he-has-a-son-or-sons-still-living

My question is, what things can I do that will make me a good and virtuous wife to him? What manners should I have and what practices should I follow? What rules are there about women in the mosque? Also, how should I read the Holy Book?","['Praise be to Allah.Welcome to Islam message\nWe praise Allah Who has lighted the path of truth for you and enabled you to become convinced of Islam which is the true religion. All you have to do now is to utter the Two Testimonies of Faith (the Shahadatayn) in order to set your affairs straight, and you will be granted divine support in this world and in the Hereafter. So hasten to take this step and I ask Allah to make you steadfast in adhering to His religion. Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.\xa0\nHow to be a righteous wife in Islam\nIn order to be a righteous wife with whom Allah is pleased, we advise you, after obeying Allah, to obey your husband so long as he does not tell you to do anything wrong or sinful, for a wife’s obedience towards her husband is one of the most important principles of marriage propagated in Islam.\xa0\nMu`adh ibn Jabal (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If I were to command anyone to prostrate to anyone else, I would have commanded women to prostrate to their husbands, because of the husband’s great rights. No woman can find the sweetness of faith until she fulfils her husband’s rights , even if he calls her to him when she is atop her camel.” \xa0\nAl-Haythami (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0“This was narrated in full by Al-Bazzar and in part by Ahmad, and the men of its Isnad [chain of narration] are the men of sahih.” (Majma` Az-Zawa’id, 4/309)\xa0\nGive up the bad customs that you used to engage in before Islam\xa0\nAfter that you have to give up the bad customs that you used to engage in before your Islam, that go against Islam and its commandments.\xa0\n\nThat includes Tabarruj (wanton display) , being unveiled and not wearing proper Islamic Hijab – if you are one of those who do not wear Islamic dress. You also have to give up such customs of the disbelievers as mixing with men, and making friends with men who are not your Mahrams.\xa0\nYou have to get used to Muslim customs and the commands of their religion which teaches that the Muslim woman is to be protected and not to wander about half naked in the marketplaces and places where there is free mixing with men, because that offends her husband’s honour. \xa0\n\nLifestyle after conversion to Islam\nWith regard to the way of life that you have to follow, that is by adhering to the commands enjoined by Allah and by avoiding the things that Allah has forbidden; that includes praying and fasting regularly and remembering Allah in all situations. In all of that it will help if you read the Quran and useful books which describe Islam and its teachings.\xa0\nEtiquettes of entering the mosque\nWith regard to the guidelines on women entering the mosque , they are as follows:\xa0\n\nShe should not go out wearing perfume , adornment or make-up. This does not apply only to going out to the mosque, rather whenever she goes out of her house, it is prohibited for her to go out wearing makeup. Her purpose in going out of the house should be to pray to Allah or to attend a lesson from which she can learn the rulings of her religion.\xa0\n\nAbu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not prevent the female slaves of Allah from going to the mosques of Allah , but let them go out not wearing perfume.”\xa0(Narrated by Abu Dawud, 565; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud, 529)\xa0\n\nIt is Sunnah for the Muslim, when he leaves his house and heads towards the mosque, to recite the Du`a for walking to the mosque:\xa0\n\n`Abdullah ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “… Then the Mu’adhdhin gave the call to prayer, and he (the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)) came out, saying, ‘Allahumma aj`al fi qalbi nuran wa fi lisani nuran waj’al fi sam’i nuran waj’al fi basari nuran waj`al min khalfi nuran wa min amami nuran waj`al min fawqi nuran wa min tahti nuran, Allahummah a`tini nuran (O Allah, place with my heart light, and upon my tongue light, and within my ears light and within my eyes light, and place behind me light and in front of me light and above me light and beneath me light, O Allah, bestow upon me light).”\xa0(Narrated by Muslim, 763)\xa0\n\nWhen one enters the mosque, one should enter with his right foot first, and say the words that were narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him):\xa0\n\nAbu Humayd or Abu Usayd (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When any one of you enters the mosque, let him say: Allahumma iftah li abwab rahmatika (O Allah, open to me the gates of Your mercy), and when he leaves let him say, Allahumma inni as’aluka min fadlika (O Allah, I ask You of Your bounty).”\xa0(Narrated by Muslim, 713)\xa0\nAccording to some reports, the words Bismillah, Allahumma salli ‘ala Muhammad (In the name of Allah, O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad) are added at the beginning of each.\xa0(See At-Tirmidhi, 314; Ibn Majah, 771. Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah, 625)\xa0\nHaywah ibn Shurayh (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “I met ‘Uqbah ibn Muslim and said to him, ‘I heard that you narrated from ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr ibn Al-‘As that when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) entered the mosque, he would say, “A’udhu Billah il-‘Athim wa bi wajhihi’l-karim wa sultanihi’l-qadim min Ash-shaytan ir-rajim (O Allah, I seek refuge in Your noble countenance and Your eternal authority from the accursed satan).”’ He said, ‘Is that all?’ I said, ‘Yes.’ He said, ‘And when he said that, the devil said, “He is protected from me for the whole day.”’”\xa0(Narrated by Abu Dawud, 466; classed as authentic by Shaykh Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud, 441)\xa0\n\nWhen the Muslim enters the mosque, he should not sit down until he has prayed two Rak`ahs to “greet the mosque ”.\xa0\n\nAbu Qutadah As-Sulami (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When any one of you enters the mosque, let him pray two Rak’ahs before he sits down.”\xa0(Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 443; Muslim, 714)\xa0\nAbu Dawud (455) narrated that `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded that mosques should be built in every neighbourhood, and that they should be cleaned and perfumed.\xa0(Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud, 437.)\xa0\n\nThe mosque should be cleaned and perfumed by those who are able to do it:\n\nAbu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The deeds of my Ummah, both good and bad, were shown to me, and I found that among the best of its deeds was removing a harmful thing from the road, and I found among the worst of its deeds leaving phlegm in the mosque and not burying it.” (Narrated by Muslim, 555)\xa0\n\nNot raising one’s voice in the mosque , even in reciting the Quran, because that may disturb one of the worshippers.\xa0\n\nAbu Sa’id (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) went into I’tikaf (seclusion or retreat for worship) in the mosque, and he heard them reciting Quran in loud voices. He pulled back the curtain and said: “Each one of you is conversing with his Lord, so do not disturb one another and do not raise your voices above one another in reciting the Quran” – or he said, “in prayer”.\xa0(Narrated by Abu Dawud, 1332; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud, 1183)\xa0\n\nHe should exit the mosque with the left foot first, and saying the Du`a narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).\xa0\n\nAbu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When any one of you enters the mosque, let him send blessings upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and say, Allahumma iftah li abwab rahmatika (O Allah, open to me the gates of Your mercy). And when he leaves let him send blessings upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and say, Allahumma i’simni min Ash-Shaytan ir-rajim (O Allah, protect me from the accursed satan).\xa0(Narrated by Ibn Majah, 773. This Hadith was classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Al-Jami’, 515)\xa0\nBenefits of reading the Quran\nWith regard to reading the Quran, you should read it a lot, because for every letter that you read you will have ten Hasanat (good deeds). It is permissible to recite the Quran with or without Wudu’, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to remember Allah in all situations. (Narrated by Muslim, 373) But it is better to do Wudu’ before reciting the Quran.\xa0\nMuhajir ibn Qunfudh (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that he came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) whilst he was urinating and greeted him with Salam, but he did not return the greeting until he had done wudu’. Then he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) apologised to him and said, “I did not want to mention Allah when I was not in a state of purity.”\xa0(Narrated by Abu Dawud, 17 – this version was narrated by him; Ibn Majah, 350. Classed as authentic by Shaykh Al-Albani in Sahih Al-Jami’, 2472)\xa0\nBut it is prohibited for one who is Junub (in a state of impurity following sexual activity) to recite the Quran. With regard to a menstruating woman, the correct view is that it is permissible for her to recite the Quran. Please see question no.\xa02564 .\xa0\nAll of that has to do with reciting the Quran without touching the Mus-haf. With regard to touching the Mus-haf , that is only permissible for one who has Wudu’, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “No one should touch the Quran except one who is pure.”\xa0(Narrated by Malik in Al-Muwatta’, 419; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Irwa’ Al-Ghalil, 122)\xa0\nIf the Muslim wants to read from the Mus-haf and he does not have Wudu’, he should hold the book with something in between, such as wearing gloves on his hands.\xa0\nIt is Sunnah for him to be humble and think of the meaning of the verses that he is reading. He should ask about the meaning if he finds the words difficult to understand, so that he will increase in knowledge whilst reading. After that he should strive to act in accordance with what he has learned and apply the rulings of the Quran.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9232/etiquettes-of-entering-the-mosque
