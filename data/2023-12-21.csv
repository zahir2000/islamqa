305881,Is garnishing or decorating food one of the objectives of sharia? Or does it come under the heading of excess which is haram?,"['Praise be to Allah.The objectives of sharia are things which Islam prescribes in order to preserve faith, life, reason, wealth and honour. The food that comes under the heading of the objectives of sharia is that which is necessary to sustain life and provide strength and nourishment to the body so that the individual may take care of what he needs for his spiritual and physical well-being.\nGarnishing and decorating food is not one of the objectives of sharia in this sense.\nAl-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said, commenting on the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning), {and eat and drink, but be not excessive} [al-A‘raf 7:31]: As for what is necessary, which is what will ward off hunger and quench thirst, that is recommended on the basis of reason and according to Islamic teachings, because it is necessary to preserve life and faculties. End quote from Tafsir al-Qurtubi (7/191).\nThere is nothing of that which could include garnishing and decorating food.\nIf garnishing and decorating food is not extravagant or excessive, then it is one of the things that are permissible in principle.\nBut if what the questioner means by saying “one of the objectives of sharia” is that it comes under the heading of things that people regard as desirable and is permissible, then yes, it is prescribed and permissible in that sense. In the hadith it says that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Eat and drink, give charity and wear clothes, without showing off or being extravagant.”\nNarrated by Ahmad in al-Musnad (6695); classed as hasan by al-Albani in Sahih al-Targhib wa’l-Tarhib (2145).\nIt was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Eat whatever you wish, wear whatever you wish, so long as you avoid two things: extravagance and showing off.\nNarrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah in al-Musannaf (26492).\nWhat could serve as an indication that garnishing or decorating food is permissible, and that it is regarded as something good, is what was narrated by the Mother of the Believers ‘A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), who said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to like sweets and honey. Narrated by al-Bukhari (5277).\nIbn Battal (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The meaning of this hadith includes everything that is similar to sweets and honey of all kinds of delicious food that are sweet in taste.""(Sharh Sahih al-Bukhari – Ibn Battal\xa0 9/494).\nAl-Khattabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The word sweets (al-halwa’) only applies to sweets that are made by humans.""(A‘lam al-Hadith\xa0 3/2053). This is a type of garnishing or decorating food.\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: al-Nawawi said, when discussing the permissibility of eating two types of fruits and other things together, and the permissibility of eating two types of food together: From this it may be understood that it is permissible to have various types of food when eating, and there is no difference of opinion among the scholars regarding the permissibility of that.""(Fath al-Bari by Ibn Hajar\xa0 9/573).\nBased on that, it is permissible to garnish and decorate food with food of different shapes and types, so long as it does not reach the level of extravagance and showing off.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/305881/does-garnishing-or-decorating-food-come-under-the-heading-of-excess-which-is-haram
225943,"I want to do some kind of exercise to increase my physical strength, but I want to do that in an Islamic manner. Did the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) do this kind of exercise? What is the style of swimming that the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) used to do?","['Praise be to Allah.The strong believer is better and more beloved to Allah\xa0\nMuslim (2664) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The strong believer is better and more beloved to Allah than the weak believer, although both are good.”\nThis strength includes both physical strength and strength of faith, as we have explained in the answer to question no.\xa010238 .\nAllah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And their prophet said to them, `Indeed, Allah has sent to you Saul as a king.’ They said, `How can he have kingship over us while we are more worthy of kingship than him and he has not been given any measure of wealth?’ He said, `Indeed, Allah has chosen him over you and has increased him abundantly in knowledge and stature. And Allah gives His sovereignty to whom He wills. And Allah is all-Encompassing [in favour] and Knowing.’”\xa0[Al-Baqarah 2:247]\n“and has increased him abundantly in knowledge and stature” means: He has favoured him over you and given him more in terms of knowledge and stature; in other words, He has given him deep insight and physical strength by means of which he is qualified for his post as king, for if he has deep insight and the ability to implement the right decision, he will be able to fulfil this role in the best manner, but if he were lacking in either of these two qualities, he would not be able to do his job properly. If he were physically strong but lacked deep insight, then the king would be unsuccessful in running the kingdom’s affairs, because his strength would not be used in a wise manner. If he had deep insight but did not have the strength to implement any decisions he made, his insight would not benefit him because he would not be able to achieve anything."" (Tafsir As-Sa`di, p. 107)\nHaving physical strength, health and soundness helps a person to worship Allah by praying, fasting, performing Hajj, striving in Jihad, and so on. Being physically weak and sick is an impediment in doing many acts of worship.\nWhat are the guidelines of practising sport in Islam?\nThere are matters of Islamic etiquette that one should pay attention to when playing sports and doing exercises to strengthen the body:\n\nSeeking reward with Allah, and doing these things to help one worship Him and support those who have been wronged.\nThese activities should not involve anything that is contrary to Islamic teachings, such as participants bowing to one another , striking the face, uncovering the `awrah, gambling, and so on.\nIt should not distract one from obeying and worshipping Allah, honouring one’s parents and other important priorities.\nOne should not spend great amounts of wealth on it, to the point of extravagance; rather one’s involvement in such activities should be based on moderation and within the framework of Islamic teachings.\n\nDid Prophet Muhammad Exercise?\nWe do not know of anything in the Sunnah to indicate that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to do this kind of exercise or play sports as known nowadays. For Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, perfected His blessings upon him in all his affairs, and granted him perfect physical strength and strength of faith.\nWhat we know of such matters that is proven in the Sunnah is the following:\n\nFirstly: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) wrestled with Rukanah (may Allah be pleased with him) before he became Muslim.\n\nAbu Dawud (4078) narrated that Rukanah (may Allah be pleased with him) wrestled with the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) threw him to the ground. (Classed as sound by Al-Albani in Al-Irwaa’ (5/329)\n\nSecondly: he raced with his wife `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her).\n\nAbu Dawud (2578) and Ahmad (26277) narrated that `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: I went out with the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on one of his journeys when I was still young and had not put on weight. He said to the people: “Go on ahead.” So they went on ahead, then he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to me, “Come, let me race with you.” So I raced with him, and I beat him, and he said nothing. Later, when I had put on some weight, and I had forgotten about it, I went out with him on one of his journeys, and he said to the people: “Go on ahead.” So they went on ahead, then he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to me, “Come, let me race with you.” So I raced with him, and he beat me, then he smiled and said: “This is in return for that.” (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Saheeh Abu Dawud)\n\nThirdly: archery. Al-Bukhari narrated (3373) that Salamah ibn Al-Akwa` (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) passed by a group of Aslam who were competing in shooting arrows. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Shoot, O sons of Isma`il, for your father was an archer. Shoot, and I am with the tribe of So-and-so.” One of the two groups stopped shooting, so the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “What is the matter with you, why are you not shooting?” They said: O Messenger of Allah, how could we shoot when you are with them? He said: “Shoot, for I am with all of you.”\n\nDid the Companions exercise?\nUndoubtedly the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) used to train in horsemanship and the skills of fighting and running, and they were extremely strong and tough.\nSuch matters vary from one time to another, and from one situation to another.\nWith regard to swimming , it is soundly narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that he said: “Everything in which there is no remembrance of Allah is idle play, except four things: a man playing with his wife; a man training his horse; a man running between two lines (as in a race); and a man learning how to swim .” (Narrated by An-Nasa’i in As-Sunan Al-Kubra (8889); classed as authentic by Al-Albani in As-Sahihah (315)\nWe do not know of any report from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) about swimming which suggests that he did it himself.\nWith regard to the words, “Teach your children to swim, shoot arrows and ride horses,” we do not know of any report with this wording from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nA similar phrase was narrated from him, “Teach your sons to swim and shoot arrows, and teach girls to spin.” But this is a very inauthentic Hadith.

335145,"I read on a website the words “Let Allah work through you and trust Him, for the whole universe is running in the most beautiful way, so why would He be unable to take care of you? Why should you worry or fear for yourself? Roses do not worry and neither do stars.” Is it permissible to speak in this way?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly: trusting in Allah and relying on Him is something that is required according to Islamic teachings\nTrusting in Allah, depending on Him and relying on Him is something that is required according to Islamic teachings, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{To Allah belongs all that is unseen in the heavens and on earth, and to Him all things will return. So worship Him [alone] and put your trust in Him, for your Lord is not unaware of what you do}\xa0[Hud 11:123]\n{Put your trust in the Ever-Living Who never dies, and glorify and praise Him. Your Lord is sufficiently aware of the sins of His slaves}\xa0[Al-Furqan 25:58]\n{Put your trust in Allah, for sufficient is Allah as a disposer of affairs}\xa0[Al-Ahzab 33:3].\nAllah, may He be exalted, is the Disposer of affairs Who is taking care of His slaves; He is the Provider who provides for them; He is the Most Merciful and no one is more merciful to them than Him; He is the Sustainer by Whom everything is sustained. Whoever puts his trust in Allah, He will suffice him; whoever turns to Him, He will guide him; whoever believes in Him, He will provide for him; whoever relies on Him, He will not let him down.\nAllah, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Whoever fears Allah, He will grant him a way out [from difficulty],\nand will provide for him from where he does not expect. Whoever puts his trust in Allah, He will suffice him. Allah will surely attain His purpose. Allah has set a measure [and appointed term] for all things}\xa0[Al-Talaq 65:2-3].\nAhmad (205) narrated from ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab that he heard the Prophet of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “If you were to put your trust in Allah as you should, you would be given provision like the birds: they go out hungry in the morning and come back with full bellies in the evening.”\nAs the entire universe is running by the might of Allah and is under His control, how could Allah not be able to look after His slaves’ affairs? As Allah has guaranteed to provide and care for His slaves, then why worry?\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{There is no creature that lives on the earth but its sustenance is guaranteed by Allah. He knows its dwelling place and its resting place; all is [inscribed] in a clear record}\xa0[Hud 11:6].\nWhatever befalls a person of exhaustion, fatigue or worry, Allah will expiate his sins thereby, and whatever happens was already decreed before the individual was created, so what is the benefit of feeling depressed or troubled?\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{No calamity befalls the earth or your own selves but it is already written in a Book before We make it happen. Verily, that is easy for Allah.\n[Know this] so that you do not grieve for what passes you by, nor exult over what He gives you, for Allah does not love anyone who is conceited and boastful}\xa0[al-Hadid 57:22-23].\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “No fatigue, constant pain, worry, grief, harm or distress befalls a believer, not even a thorn that pricks him, but Allah will expiate some of his sins thereby.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (5642) and Muslim (2573).\nSecondly: what is required of the individual is to observe proper etiquette when addressing the Lord of the Worlds\nThe words mentioned are correct, as they invite people to trust and rely on Allah, and not be worried or distressed. But the way the phrase “Let Allah work through you” is worded is not correct and is not appropriate to the majesty of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. For Allah does not need permission from anyone and He does not act through anyone – exalted and sanctified be Allah. For no one could ward off His bounty or prevent it from reaching anyone. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Whatever Allah opens up for people of His mercy, none can withhold it, and whatever He withholds, none can grant it thereafter. And He is the Almighty, the Most Wise}\xa0[Fatir 35:2]\n{If Allah afflicts you with harm, none can remove it but He; if He wills some good for you, none can avert His bounty, which He bestows upon whomever He will among His slaves. And He is the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful}\xa0[Yunus 10:107].\nOne of the supplications and adhkar of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), when he had finished the obligatory prayer, was to say: “La ilaha illa Allah wahdahu laa sharika lah, lahu al-mulk wa lahu’l-hamd wa huwa ‘ala kulli shay’in qadir. Allahumma la mani‘a lima a‘tayta wa la mu‘tiya lima mana‘ta wa la yanfa‘u dha’l-jaddi minka al-jadd (There is no god worthy of worship except Allah alone, with no partner or associate; His is the Dominion, to Him be praise, and He has power over all things. O Allah, none can withhold what You give and none can give what You withhold, and the good fortune of any fortunate person is to no avail against You.)”\nNarrated by al-Bukhari (6615) and Muslim (593) from al-Mughirah ibn Shu‘bah.\nImam al-Bukhari included this hadith in a chapter in his Sahih entitled Chapter: None can withhold what Allah gives.\nIn Sahih Muslim (477) it is narrated that Abu Sa‘id al-Khudri said: When the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) raised his head after bowing, he would say: “Our Lord, to You be praise, filling the heavens and the earth, and filling whatever You will besides that. You are worthy of praise and glorification; this is the truest thing that a slave can say, and all of us are Your slaves. O Allah, none can withhold what You give and none can give what You withhold, and the good fortune of any fortunate person is to no avail against You.”\nEven though the one who spoke these words meant nothing but good, what is required is to adhere to proper etiquette when addressing the Lord of the Worlds and speaking of Him, and we must be careful to speak of Allah in words that are appropriate to His greatness, majesty and affection.\nThe individual is the doer of his deeds, by his choice and will, but Allah is the Creator of him and his will. He knows what he will do, and He, may He be glorified, helps and guides whomever He wills of His slaves; if they are deprived of His help and guidance, they will go astray. Hence the people of Paradise will say (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Praise be to Allah Who has guided us to this, for we would never have been guided if Allah had not guided us}\xa0[Al-A‘raf 7:43].\nWe ask Allah to guide us and help us to do that which He loves and which pleases Him.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/335145/is-it-permissible-to-say-let-allah-work-through-you-and-trust-him
121759,"Here in Kuwait, discount coupons are distributed to university students, for a discount between 5-25% for many places, such as restaurants, clothing stores and bookstores, et cetera. These discounts are obtained by buying coupons for the discounts, the cost of which is five dinars. There are some people who say that this price covers advertising costs or other expenses of the company that distributes these coupons. Is it permissible to buy these coupons and use them?","['Praise be to Allah.Types of coupons\nDiscount coupons that are issued by advertising and marketing companies, or by travel companies, or some shopping centres, which give a certain discount on the prices of goods and services offered by a group of companies or other organisations, may be divided into two categories:\n\nCoupons that are obtained in return for payment through an annual subscription.\nFree coupons which are obtained as gifts to purchasers to encourage them to buy from companies. They may be given for free to anyone whose purchases reach a certain limit.\n\nPaid for coupons\nAs for the coupons which are obtained in return for payment, they are prohibited, because they involve several infractions of Islamic teachings, including the following:\n\nAmbiguity, because the purchaser pays a certain amount of money for the coupons, with the aim of obtaining a discount, but it is not known how much this discount really is. He may not use the coupon, or he may use it and get a discount that is less or more than what he paid.\xa0\n\nThe Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade transactions involving ambiguity. Narrated by Muslim (1513). This includes every transaction in which there is an unknown element.\n\nThis transaction is based on risk, because there may be gain or loss. The purchaser risks the amount he paid in return for the coupons, then he will either gain if he gets a discount that is greater than what he paid, or he will lose, if the discount is less than what he paid. This is the essence of gambling which is prohibited according to Islamic teachings:\n\n{O you who have believed, indeed, intoxicants, gambling, [sacrificing on] stone alters [to other than Allah ], and divining arrows are but defilement from the work of Satan, so avoid it that you may be successful}\xa0[Al-Ma’idah 5:90].\n\nThese coupons deceive people, cheat them and take their wealth unlawfully, because most of these promised discounts are illusionary and are not real.\n\nMany shopkeepers raise their prices, then give the impression to the coupon holder that they are giving him a discount, when in fact the discount is on the increase they made when they raised the price above the price in other stores.\n\nThese coupons often cause disputes, because the company that issues the coupons has no power to compel shopping centres, companies and stores to give the percentage of discount that was agreed upon, and that leads to disputes and conflicts.\n\nWhatever is a cause of dispute, conflict and rancour must be disallowed, as Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Satan only wants to cause between you animosity and hatred through intoxicants and gambling and to avert you from the remembrance of Allah and from prayer. So will you not desist}\xa0[Al-Ma’idah 5:91].\n\nThese types of coupons are detrimental to the shopkeepers who do not participate in the discount program.\n\n“Dealing with the coupons mentioned leads to the stirring up of enmity and rancour among shopkeepers, between those who participate in the discount program and those who do not participate, as products sell out in the stores that give the discount, whereas those who do not participate in the discount program get stuck with products that do not sell.” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah,\xa014/10)\n\nThe subscription fees paid for these coupons are not in return for any real gain. If the purchaser asks the shopkeeper to give him the discount, he may get the discount that was promised by those who sold the coupons, or a similar discount, or he may not get any discount at all, in which case he will have paid for the coupon without getting anything in return. This comes under the heading of consuming people’s wealth unlawfully, which is prohibited according to the Quranic text (interpretation of the meaning):{O you who have believed, do not consume one another’s wealth unjustly }\xa0[An-Nisa’ 4:29].\n\nThe Fiqh Council of the Muslim World League issued a statement in its eighteenth session stating that it is prohibited to deal in these coupons. Among other things, they stated:\n“After listening to the research presented on this topic and a great deal of discussion, it was determined that it is not permissible to issue or purchase the discount coupons mentioned, if that is in return for payment of a specific price or an annual subscription, because it involves ambiguity. That is because the one who purchases the coupon pays money but does not know what he will get in return for it, thus loss is certain in return for possible gain.”\nSimilarly, the Permanent Committee for Ifta’ stated that it is prohibited to deal in this type of discount coupons. This was also stated in Fatwas issued by Shaykh Ibn Baz and Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on them). (See:\xa0Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah\xa0(14/6) and\xa0Fatawa Ibn Baaz,\xa019/58)\nFree coupons\nWith regard to free coupons that are offered to purchasers without them having to pay anything in return, there is nothing wrong with using them and benefitting from them, because giving coupons for free comes under the heading of a gift , and ambiguity with regard to gifts is overlooked.\nMoreover, if the one who receives a free coupon does not use it to get a discount, he does not lose anything.\nThis was mentioned in a statement of the Fiqh Council in which it said: “If the discount coupons are issued for free, without having to pay anything, then issuing them and accepting them is permissible according to Islamic teachings, because it comes under the heading of a promise of a gift.”\nFor more information, please see:\n\nBitaqat At-Takhfid: Haqiqatuha At-Tijariyyah wa Ahkamuha Ash-Shar‘iyyah, by Shaykh Bakr Abu Zayd.\nAl-Hawafiz At-Tijariyyah At-Taswiqiyyah wa Ahkamuha fi’l-Fiqh Al-Islami\xa0by Dr, Khalid Al-Muslih.\n\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 3223 and 8938 .\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/121759/are-discount-coupons-permissible-in-islam
