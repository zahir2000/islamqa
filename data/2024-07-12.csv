261224,"Did the Messenger of Allah Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) die or was he martyred by the poison of the Jewish woman? If he was martyred by the poison of the Jewish woman, then how can we refute the specious argument about the way to reconcile between his hadith when he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) told the Mother of the Believers ‘Aa’ishah about his feeling that his aorta had been severed, and the passage in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe impact of the poison on the death of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)\nA number of scholars have stated clearly that Allah, may He be exalted, honoured His Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) with martyrdom; thus He granted him the combined honours of prophethood, messengership and martyrdom, because his death resulted from the poison that he ate on the day of Khaybar.\nIt was narrated from Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) that a Jewish woman brought some poisoned mutton to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and he ate some of it. She was brought to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and he asked her about that. She said: I wanted to kill you. He said: “Allah could never have enabled you to do that.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (2474) and Muslim (2190).\nIt was narrated from ‘A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to say, during the illness of which he died: “O ‘Aa’ishah, I still feel the pain of the food that I ate in Khaybar, and now I feel that my aorta is being severed from that poison.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (4165).\nIbn al-Qayyim said in Zad al-Ma‘ad (4/111): He survived for three years after that, until his final sickness, when he said: “I still feel the pain of the mutton that I ate on the day of Khaybar, but now is the time for my aorta to be severed.” Thus the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) died as a martyr. End quote.\nIt says in Sharh az-Zarqani ‘ala al-Mawahib al-Laduniyyah bi’l-Minah al-Muhammadiyyah (12/94): It was a miracle that the poison did not affect him immediately, because they said: If he is a prophet, it will not harm him, and if he is just a king, we will be rid of him. When it did not affect him, they became certain that he was a prophet, and it was even said that the Jewish woman became Muslim. Then its effect came back three years later, so that he would be honoured with martyrdom. End quote.\nSecondly:\nWhat is meant by the verses in which Allah, may He be exalted, says: \n{We would surely have seized him by the right hand,\nthen We would surely have severed his aorta}\nWith regard to the verses in Surat al-Haqqah, Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Verily, I swear by all that you can see\nand by all that you cannot see\nthat verily it [the Quran] is a word conveyed by a noble Messenger,\nNor is it the words of a soothsayer. Little is it that you pay heed!\nIt is a revelation from the Lord of the worlds.\nIf he [Muhammad] had falsely attributed something to Us,\nWe would surely have seized him by the right hand,\nthen We would surely have severed his aorta,\nand not one of you could have protected him.\nVerily, it [the Quran] is a reminder for the righteous.\nIndeed, We know full well that among you are some who reject it,\nand indeed it will be a cause of regret for the disbelievers [in the hereafter, because of their rejection of it].\nIndeed, it is certain truth.\nSo glorify the name of your Lord, the Most Great}\xa0[al-Haqqah 69:38-52].\nIn this passage, Allah, may He be exalted, tells us that the Quran is a revelation from Him which His noble Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) conveyed to the people; and that it is not poetry or soothsaying, for Muhammad is neither a poet nor a soothsayer, and he does not falsely attribute anything to Allah, for if he were to attribute anything falsely to Allah – and he is far above doing such a thing, then Allah would hasten to punish him and wreak vengeance upon him with force, then He would cause him to die, and no one would be able to ward that off from him.\nThen Allah tells us that the Quran is true, and that it would be a cause of regret for the disbelievers who reject it.\nThese verses contain praise of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and proof of his honesty. So how could the ignorant and misguided regard it as a criticism of him?\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) spent twenty-three years conveying the word of Allah to the people. If he had fabricated it or falsely attributed it to Allah, Allah would have destroyed him, but that never happened and could never have happened.\nThis means that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) conveyed the surahs of the Quran to the people with all sincerity and truthfulness; he attributed dozens of hadiths qudsi to Allah and spoke thousands of hadiths, which he told the people were revelation from Allah. And Allah honoured him, gave him strength, helped him, supported him, increased the number of his companions, enabled him to conquer many lands, softened the people’s hearts towards him and supported him with clear miracles. He did not cause him to die until after He had perfected His religion for him and completed His blessing upon him.\nWould any rational person believe that Allah would not have hastened to punish him and wreak vengeance upon him, when He had issued a warning that He would do that if he were to attribute anything falsely to Him?\nCan this mean anything except one thing: that he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was faithful and sincere in conveying the words of his Lord throughout those twenty-three years, and he did not attribute even one word falsely to Allah during this lengthy period? Hence Allah did not cause him to be doomed as He had warned if he were to attribute anything falsely to Him. So does it make sense to suggest that after he had conveyed the religion in its entirety, and had conveyed the Quran in its entirety, faithfully and with honesty and sincerity, that he would then attribute something falsely to Allah?\nThis is nothing but the words of crazy and foolish people!\nIbn ‘Ashur (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his commentary on this passage: What we may conclude from this passage is another proof that the Quran was sent down from Allah, as the scholars of ‘ilm al-kalam would say, after the first proof, which is based on the oath and affirmation, on the basis of what the religious texts indicate. This is an indication based on what is established in people’s minds, that Allah is immense in power and that He is all-knowing. Therefore He could not allow anyone to attribute to Him words that He did not say. In other words, if the Quran was not sent down from Us, and Muhammad claimed that it was sent down from Us, We would not have let him continue like that, and We would have hastened his doom.\nThe fact that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was not doomed indicates that he did not attribute the Quran falsely to Allah. The word {If [law]} implies that the matter mentioned in the conditional sentence did not happen …\nWhat is meant by {We would surely have seized him by the right hand} is: We would have seized him forcefully, that is, without delay.\nIn other words: We would have seized him immediately and severed his aorta. The mentioning of this detail indicates that this seizing would be very frightening; this is why Allah did not merely state something like “We would have destroyed him.”\nThe aorta is the blood vessel to which the heart is attached. It is the major artery that supplies the body with blood; hence it is called the “river of the body.” If it is severed, the individual will die.\nSevering the aorta is one of the ways of slaughtering animals; thus the punishment of the one who falsely attributes anything to Allah is likened to the slaughter of a camel.\nThis verse indicates that Allah, may He be exalted, will not leave alone anyone who claims that Allah is revealing to him words to be conveyed to the people, and that He will hasten to destroy him.\nAs for the one who claims to be a prophet without claiming to receive revelation, Allah may destroy him after a while, as happened to al-Aswad al-‘Ansi and Musaylimah al-Hanafi, the false prophets who appeared in Yemen and al- Yamamah respectively. They did not produce words that they attributed to Allah, may He be exalted, so their destruction came after a while. Similar to them are others who made false claims of prophethood after Islam came, such as Babak and Mazyar.""(At-Tahrir wa’t-Tanwir\xa0 29/144-148).\nThe brief response to this flimsy specious argument is as follows:\nThis verse is a warning of immediate punishment and doom, if the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) were to falsely attribute some words to Allah. But what is well-known and well-established is that Allah protected the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and encompassed him with His care throughout his mission and prophethood when he was conveying the message to the people from his Lord and saying: “My Lord said; my Lord instructed me; my Lord forbade me…” And Allah never once proved him to be lying; He never let him down and He never broke a promise to him, let alone sending down a punishment upon him or bringing about his death.\nThis is definitive proof that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) never falsely attributed anything to Allah or lied about Him, for he was far above doing such a thing.\nMoreover, if he had wanted to falsely attribute something to Allah or lie about Him –and he was far above doing such a thing – , the easiest, and most likely, thing for him to do would be to omit this verse, or conceal it and not convey it, if it was from Allah.\nOr at least he would not have said anything that would prove him guilty or show him to be a liar. What need would there be for one who falsely claims to be a prophet, brings such a scripture and claims that it is from Allah to come up with such a verse, in which he threatens himself and proves himself to be guilty? Then how are they deluded?\nGlory be to the One Who turns the lies of the liars and the disbelief of the disbelievers into proof of the truthfulness of the final Prophet and the leader of the Messengers.\nIf he had been fabricating lies, he would not have said when he was dying: “Now is the time for my aorta to be severed”; he would not have referred to that at all.\nFurthermore, regarding this flimsy specious argument, we say: it is a grievous criticism of Allah, may He be exalted, to suggest that a man came and claimed to be a prophet, and he falsely attributed words and lies to Him, then for twenty-three years he spread that message, and his Lord supported him, helped him, protected him, strengthened him and granted him victory during that time by means of clear miracles that no human could ever do. This is impossible, and it is the most grievous criticism of Allah.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAllah’s way of dealing with His sincere prophets and the believers who follow them, and His way of dealing with those who lie about Allah is:\nHe supports the former and grants them an honourable renown among the later nations [26:84];\nand He wreaks vengeance upon the latter, and subjects them to His curse.\nFrom this we know that Allah would not support a liar with miracles that no one could challenge, because that would lead to a great deal of mischief and harm to people, which His mercy cannot allow, and it would lead to grave consequences, which His wisdom cannot allow and are contrary to the consistent way in which He deals with such matters, which reflects His will. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{If he [Muhammad] had falsely attributed something to Us,\nWe would surely have seized him by the right hand,\nthen We would surely have severed his aorta,\nand not one of you could have protected him }[al-Haqqah 69:44-47].\nAnd He says:\n{Had We not kept you steadfast, you would nearly have inclined towards them a little.\nIn that case, We would have made you taste a double punishment in this life, and a double punishment after death. Then you would have found none to help you against Us}\xa0[al-Isra’ 17:74-75].\nEnd quote from Sharh al-Isfahaniyyah (214-216).\nHe also said:\nThe Quran indicates that Allah, may He be glorified, does not support anyone who tells lies about Him; rather He will inevitably expose his lies and wreak vengeance upon him. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{If he [Muhammad] had falsely attributed something to Us,\nWe would surely have seized him by the right hand,\nthen We would surely have severed his aorta,\nand not one of you could have protected him}\xa0[al-Haqqah 69:44-47].\nHe says this after saying:\n{Verily, I swear by all that you can see\nand by all that you cannot see\nthat verily it [the Quran] is a word conveyed by a noble Messenger,\nNor is it the words of a soothsayer. Little is it that you pay heed!\nIt is a revelation from the Lord of the worlds}\xa0[al-Haqqah 69:38-42].\nThen He says:\n{If he [Muhammad] had falsely attributed something to Us,\nWe would surely have seized him by the right hand,\nthen We would surely have severed his aorta,\nand not one of you could have protected him}\xa0[al-Haqqah 69:44-47].\nThis verse refers to one who falsely attributes a few things to Allah, so how about one who falsely attributes the entire message to Him?!\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Or do they say: He has fabricated lies against Allah?} Then He says: {Allah eliminates falsehood and establishes the truth by His words}\xa0[ash-Shura 42:24].\nThe words {And Allah eliminates falsehood} are a continuation of the sentence, and are not connected to the conditional phrase {But if Allah so willed, He could seal up your heart } [which appears between these two phrases], because He then says: {and establishes the truth}. The grammatical structure of this phrase indicates that it is connected to and follows on from the phrase {And Allah eliminates falsehood}.\nThus His elimination of falsehood and establishing of truth is a statement informing us that He will inevitably do that. He tells us that He will inevitably eliminate falsehood and establish the truth by His words. As He sent down His words, this indicates that Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is a true prophet, because these words are a sign to support him, by means of which Allah made truth distinct from falsehood…\nMoreover, Allah vindicates the truth by His words, even though the evildoers hate it.\nFurthermore, Allah shows the truth to be true and shows falsehood to be false by His words, by means of which He creates things. Thus He makes truth manifest by virtue of signs and by virtue of the support He gives to the people of truth, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Our word has already been given to Our slaves, the Messengers,\nthat it is surely they who will be helped [against their enemies]\nAnd it is surely Our troops who will be the victors}\xa0[as-Saffat 37:171-173]\n{The word of your Lord is perfect in truth and justice}\xa0[al-An‘am 6:115]…\nBy His justice, Allah honours the one who says true things about Him and conveys His message, as He honours him and supports him, and He dishonours the one who attributes things falsely to Him, by humiliating him in a manner that is appropriate. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{As for those who took the calf for worship, wrath from their Lord and disgrace will indeed overtake them in this world; thus do We requite those who invent falsehood}\xa0[al-A‘raf 7:152].\nAbu Qilabah said: This applies to everyone who fabricates lies until the Day of Jusgement…\nIn order to use divine wisdom as evidence, we must first know what divine wisdom is.\nThen we may learn that part of His wisdom is that Allah does not regard as equal the truthful one, whom He supports with signs to confirm his truthfulness, and by granting him victory, raising him in status and causing him to prevail, and granting him an honourable renown among the later nations,\nand the one who tells lies against Him, whose lies He exposes, causing him to fail and humiliating him, and causing his end to be a bad end, and making him infamous and causing him to have a bad reputation, as indeed happened.\nThis is how things are in reality, but our aim here is to explain that what Allah caused to happen was bound to happen, according to His wisdom, for it is not possible that He would cause the opposite of that to happen. Hence this is proof that is based on the idea that what Allah causes to happen was bound to happen, and the opposite of that could not have happened. This is based on the fact that He is most wise and that His wisdom dictates that He should show signs to prove the truthfulness of His prophets and support them, and He should show signs of the liars and humiliate them.\nSee: an-Nubuwwat by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (2/897 ff).\nThe conclusion of all that is:\nThere is no one who claims to be a prophet and tells lies against Allah, then Allah gives him respite for such a long time and supports him and causes him to prevail over people to such a great extent, then causes him to die happy and content.\nMoreover, the miracle of Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is still extant… Where are the liars and fabricators?\nIf this Quran was the words of Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), the eloquent Arabs would not fail to produce something like it, either in the past or in modern times, so let these stubborn people rise to the challenge once more and produce a surah like the surahs of the Quran!\nThe one who has the slightest knowledge of the Arabic language will notice great differences between the thousands of hadiths uttered by the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and this miraculous Quran, the like of which neither Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) nor anyone else could have produced.\nIf Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was lying or making false claims, he would have claimed this Quran for himself, and thus would have attained high status among the Arabs that no one else would attain, for they all acknowledged that its words were superior to anything that humans could produce. But he is the noble and truthful Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and he would not refrain from lying to the people, then tell lies about Allah.\nSo we repeat: the ignorant failed to notice the miracle in the story of the sheep. Who told the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that it was poisoned? Who protected him from dying immediately, as his companion al-Bara’ ibn Ma‘rur (may Allah be pleased with him) died [after eating some of that meat]?\nWe may conclude with the following useful debate in the context of affirming the prophethood of our Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), which is relevant to what we have mentioned above.\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his book Hidayat al-Hayara fi Ajwibah al-Yahud wa’n-Nasara (p. 201):\nI had a debate with one whom the Jews refer to as the greatest scholar and leader. During the course of our conversation, I said to him: By rejecting Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), you are effectively speaking ill of Allah in the worst manner!\nHe was surprised by that, and said: Would someone like you say such a thing?\nI said to him: Listen, and let me explain: If you say that Muhammad was an unjust ruler who subjugated people by the sword, and he was not a messenger from Allah – at the time when he spent twenty-three years claiming that he was the Messenger of Allah Who had sent him to all people, and he said: Allah commanded me to do such and such, and He forbade me to do such and such, and He revealed to me such and such, and none of that is true [according to your claim];\nand he said: Allah has permitted me to take the women and children of those who oppose me [when captured in war], and to take their wealth as war booty, and to kill their men, but none of that is true [according to your claim];\nand he kept changing the religion of the prophets, opposing their followers and abrogating their systems of law [according to your claim] –\nthen your answer can only be either that Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, was watching that, and He witnessed it and knew about it, or that it was hidden from Him and He did not know about it.\nIf you say that He did not know about it, then you are attributing the worst type of ignorance to Him, and one who was aware of that knows more than Him.\nIf you say that He knew all of that, and He witnessed it and was watching it, then either He was able to change it and stop him and prevent him from doing that, or He was not.\nIf He was not able to stop it, then you have attributed to Him the worst type of weakness, which is contrary to His being the Lord (ar-Rabb).\nIf you say that He was able to stop it, yet He kept increasing him in honour, supporting him, helping him, raising his status, causing his message to prevail, answering his supplications, supporting him against his enemies, causing all kinds of miracles – more than a thousand – to happen at his hands; and that no one intended ill towards him but he prevailed against him, and he never offered supplication but Allah answered it, then this is a matter of the gravest injustice and foolishness that is not appropriate to be attributed to any man of reason, let alone the Lord of earth and heaven. So how about when Allah testified to his truthfulness by approving of his call and supporting him with His word? For you, this is a false testimony and a lie.\nWhen [the Jewish leader] heard that, he said: Allah forbid that He would treat a liar and a fabricator in such a manner; rather he is a true prophet and whoever follows him will succeed and prosper.\nI said: Then why do you not enter his religion?\nHe said: He was only sent to the unlettered Gentiles who have no book; as for us: we have a book which we follow.\nI said to him: Your argument is utterly flawed, for all people – scholars and ordinary people alike – know that he said that he was the Messenger of Allah to all people, and that whoever does not follow him is a disbeliever who is doomed to hell. The Jews and the Christians fought him even though they were people of the Book. If he is truly a messenger of Allah, then he must be believed in everything that he said.\nThe man fell silent, and could not answer. End quote.\nPraise be to Allah for the blessing of Islam.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/261224/a-specious-argument-about-the-death-of-the-messenger-of-allah-caused-by-poison-and-the-severing-of-his-aorta-and-the-verse-then-we-would-surely-have-severed-his-aorta
142234,"There is a person I got to know in Makkah Al-Mukarramah who I delegate from time to time to perform the obligation of `umrah on behalf of my mother and grandmother who are deceased. I also ask friends and family if they want to delegate this man to do `Umrah on behalf of their deceased loved ones. 
I pay 300 dirhams to this deputy for each deceased person on whose behalf he performs `Umrah. My role is that of a middleman between this deputy and my family and friends. I take it upon myself to pay the money transfer fee from my own money, i.e., approximately 20 dirhams for each transaction, more or less. 
My question is: 
Is what we are doing Makrooh (disliked) or Mustahab (recommended)? 
Will I have any reward for making things easy for my family and friends and for my efforts in going to the bank to do the transfer and paying the transfer fee from my own money without them knowing about this? 
I know that it would be better for me to do `Umrah myself on behalf of my mother and grandmother, but to make things easier and to increase the number of times `Umrah is done, we are doing it in this way. 
Please note that what I am doing is sincerely for the sake of Allah and without seeking any financial or material gains. May Allah reward you with all good.","[""Praise be to Allah.Can we perform `Umrah on behalf of someone else?\nThere is nothing wrong with doing `Umrah on behalf of the deceased or on behalf of one who is alive but is unable to do `Umrah himself because he is too old or is sick with a chronic disease from which there is no hope of recovery. The one who does that is doing a good deed and will be rewarded , in sha Allah.\xa0\nCan you delegate someone to perform `Umrah on behalf of a dead person?\nThere is nothing wrong with giving money to someone who will do that, but you should look for one who you think is good, righteous and has knowledge of the rulings, provided that the deputy will do what he has been appointed to do himself or will tell the one who appointed him that he is going to appoint another person to do it, because the one who appointed him may accept him delegating it to another person because he trusts him, but he may not agree to delegating it to someone else.\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about a person who appointed someone to do Hajj on behalf of his mother , then after that he found out that this person had taken on a number of such appointments. What is the ruling in that case? Please advise us, may you be forgiven.\xa0\nHe replied:\xa0\n“What a person should do is be firm in his dealings with people and should not delegate things except to a person whose religious commitment he feels at ease with in the sense that he is trustworthy and knowledgeable of what needs to be done for the task for which he has been appointed. If you want to appoint someone to do Hajj on behalf of your deceased father or mother, then you have to choose someone whose knowledge and religious commitment you trust, because many people are very ignorant about the rulings on Hajj and they do not do Hajj in the proper manner, even though they may be trustworthy in and of themselves, but they think that this is what is required of them and they make many mistakes. Such people should not be appointed to do Hajj on behalf of others, because of their lack of knowledge. And some people may have knowledge but they are not trustworthy, so you see them not caring about what they do or say during rituals of Hajj, because they are not trustworthy and are lacking in religious commitment. Such people should not be appointed either to do Hajj on behalf of others.\xa0\nThe one who wants to appoint a person to do Hajj on his behalf should choose the best in knowledge and trustworthiness of those whom he can find, so that he will do what is required of him in the best manner.\xa0\nWith regard to this man whom the questioner says he appointed to do Hajj on behalf of his mother and heard later on that he had taken on a similar task for others, it depends. Perhaps this man who took on the task of doing pilgrimage for others appointed other people to do them and he performed Hajj on behalf of the one who appointed him. But is it permissible for a person to do that, i.e., is it permissible for a person to take on the task of performing Hajj or `Umrah on behalf of a number of people, then not do it himself, rather he delegates it to other people?\xa0\nIn response to that we say that it is not permissible and is not allowed, and it comes under the heading of consuming people's wealth unlawfully, because a lot of people do business in this manner, so you see them taking on a number of pilgrimages, whether Hajj or `Umrah, on the basis that they are the ones who will do it, but then they delegate it to other people for less than the money they received for that, so they earn money in a prohibited way and they give the job of doing these pilgrimages to people who may not be approved by the people who appointed him to do this task. People should fear Allah with regard to their brothers and their own selves, because if they take this money they have taken it unlawfully, and because if a person is entrusted with something by his brothers on the basis that he is the one who is going to perform Hajj or `Umrah, it is not permissible for him to delegate that to someone else, when the one who gave him the task of doing this Hajj or `Umrah may not approve of this other person.” (Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin, 21/154)\xa0\nWhat you are doing by acting as an intermediary between the person who is delegating the action and the one who is doing `Umrah on his behalf, and spending from your own money on the transfer fees -- all of that is righteous deeds for which there is the hope that you will be rewarded, in sha Allah, because the one who guides others to do good is like the one who does it.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/142234/can-you-delegate-someone-to-perform-umrah-on-behalf-of-a-dead-person
292782,"I read that hydrogenated oils are detrimental to human health, and they are found in many foods. What is the ruling on eating these foods, if it is proven that they are detrimental to health?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nHydrogenation is a chemical process in which hydrogen is added to another substance.\nThis refers to a substance the molecules of which contain particles of hydrogen, but it can absorb more particles thereof, so it is called unsaturated.""(Al-Mawsu‘ah al-‘Arabiyyah al-‘Alamiyyah).\nHydrogenation of oils refers to a process by means of which liquid oils that are found in plants and various foods are transformed into solid fats by the addition of hydrogen.\nFresh, natural plant oils are heated in large containers until they reach a temperature of 400°C, then hydrogen gas is pumped into them under high pressure, until the unsaturated oils become saturated with particles of hydrogen gas. Other metal elements, such as aluminum and nickel, are added to speed up the process (catalysts).\nCompanies like to produce hydrogenated oils for a number of reasons, which are all aimed at increasing profits:\n1. Extending the shelf life of goods, as\xa0hydrogenation is a process that preserves food.\n2. Making food more palatable.\n3. Increasing profits by selling more goods and reducing waste.\nGlobal health agencies have warned against excessive consumption of this type of oil, because it has long-term impacts on health if it is consumed excessively.\nThe harm that it leads to includes:\n\nObesity\nRaising levels of bad cholesterol (low-density lipoprotein (LDL))\nHardening of the arteries (arteriosclerosis) and heart disease\nDigestive problems\nDegenerative diseases\n\nHydrogenated oils are found in many processed foods, including the following:\n\nFats and margarines\nFrozen vegetables\nCanned foods\nBaked goods and starchy foods\nReady-made pastries\nFried foods\nSynthetic milk or nondairy coffee creamer\n\nSecondly:\nThe basic principle is that life is to be protected and it is haram to consume anything that is clearly harmful or most likely to cause harm, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And do not kill yourselves [or one another]}\xa0[An-Nisa’ 4:29].\nAnd the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There should be neither harm nor reciprocating harm.” Narrated by Ahmad, Ibn Majah (2341); classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah.\nSo if it is proven that some food will clearly or most likely cause immediate harm, it is haram to consume the amount that will lead to such harm.\nBut these oils are used in a certain ratio that varies from one type of food to another, and the harm does not appear immediately. Perhaps many people consume them but are not harmed, because they exercise or burn it off by means of physical activity. Hence we have not come across anyone who forbids consuming foods that contain these oils. But they should be avoided as much as possible, and there are sufficient beneficial and permissible foods so that we have no need of those foods.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/292782/is-it-haram-to-eat-foods-containing-hydrogenated-oils
42574,One of my neighbours told me that the Qiblah towards which I was praying was wrong and was not in accordance with the Qiblah of the neighbouring mosque.,"['Praise be to Allah.Facing the Qiblah in prayer: Essential?\nFacing the Qiblah is one of the conditions of prayer being valid . Every worshipper has to make sure he faces the Qiblah in his prayer, and strive to make sure he is facing in the right direction, whether by means of natural signs or using a compass , if he is able to do that, or by asking trustworthy people in that place who know in which direction the Qiblah is.\xa0\nWhat happens if you pray in the wrong direction?\nIt seems most likely in the case that you describe that the deviation from the Qiblah was very slight. This slight deviation is something that can happen when a person who lives in that area is a little confused and people do not pay attention to this slight difference in direction .\xa0\nIf that is the case, i.e., if the deviation from the Qiblah was slight, then it does not matter and it does not invalidate the prayer, because those who are far away from the Ka`bah have to face in its general direction; they do not have to face precisely in that direction.\xa0\nAt-Tirmidhi (342) and Ibn Majah (1011) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whatever is between the east and the west is the Qiblah.” (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Al-Irwa’)\xa0\nAs-San`ani (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Subul As-Salam (1/260). This hadith indicates that what is required is to face in that direction, and not towards the precise location of the Ka`bah when one cannot see it.\xa0\nFurther evidence to this effect is to be seen in the report narrated by Al-Bukhari (144) and Muslim (264) from Abu Ayyub (may Allah be pleased with him) who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If you need to relieve yourself, then do not face the Qiblah or turn your back towards it, whether you are urinating or defecating, rather face to the east or to the west.”\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Sharh Al-`Umdah:\xa0\n“This is stating that facing any direction other than the east or the west means that one is either facing the Qiblah or turning one’s back towards it. This was addressed to the people of Madinah and everyone who was in the same direction (in relation to Makkah), because this was the consensus of the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them). `\nUmar said: Whatever is between the east and the west is the Qiblah except at the House.\xa0 And it was narrated that `Uthman (may Allah be pleased with him) said: How can a man make a mistake in his prayer when whatever is between the east and the west is the Qiblah, so long he does not turn towards the east deliberately.\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Thus we know that the matter is broad in scope. So if we see a person praying in a direction that is slightly off from the Qiblah, that does not matter, because he is facing in its general direction, and this is what he is obliged to do.” (Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti`, 2/273)\nBut if the deviation from the direction of the Qiblah was very great , so that you were not praying in the direction of the Qiblah at all, such as if you were praying towards the east when the Qiblah is towards the west or the north, for example, so long as you based your action on the words of someone who you know attaches great importance to the prayer and you thought that they knew better about the direction of the Qiblah, then you do not have to do anything, and the prayers which you offered are still valid, even if you faced the wrong direction when you prayed, because if a person tries his best to get it right, he has done what is required of him, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“So keep your duty to Allah and fear Him as much as you can.”\xa0[At-Taghabun 64:16]\nIt says in Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah (6/314): “If a worshipper does his best to figure out the direction of the Qiblah and prays, then he finds out that he was mistaken, his prayer is still valid.”\xa0\nIn Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) (10/421) it says:\xa0\n“If a believer does his best to figure out the direction of the Qiblah, when he is in the desert or is in a city in which he is not sure where the Qiblah is, and he prays on that basis, then he finds out that he prayed in a direction other than the Qiblah, then he should continue to pray according to his latest estimate, if he believes that it is more correct than his first estimate. His first prayer is still valid because he did his best to work out the Qiblah.”\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/42574/accidentally-prayed-in-the-wrong-direction
