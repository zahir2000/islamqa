112162,"If someone gets married with a dowry, some of which is to be paid immediately and some of which – according to local custom – is deferred until the time of death or separation, is that valid?","['Praise be to Allah.This deferral is valid, whether they state it explicitly or that is in accordance with\xa0 their established custom.\nBased on that, neither the woman nor her\xa0 family has any right to demand the deferred portion when she is still married to him, and she has no right to refuse to go back to him until she receives the deferred portion, because they agreed at the time of the marriage contract to delay it in the manner mentioned above. If she goes to her family and they say: We will not let her return until the husband pays what remains of the dowry, they have no right to do that, and their refusal to let her go back is wrong and has no justification. If she persists in refusing to go back to him on these grounds only, she has no right to maintenance from the husband, because she is showing defiant disobedience, and the woman who shows defiant disobedience has no right to maintenance.

112520,"I work in a car showroom, and they sell new cars by instalments. Sometimes I have my own customer and I do not have cash money to cover the value of the car, so I buy it from the dealer who owns it, with payment to be made in two months’ time, and I give him two thousand extra. For example, if the cash value of the car is forty thousand, he sells it to me for forty-two thousand, and after that I sell it to my own customer by instalments. Is this permissible?","['Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with increasing the price when selling by instalments and charging more than the cash price. This has been explained previously in the answers to questions no. 13722 and 1847 .\nThe transaction that you have asked about is permissible, if it meets two conditions:\n\nThat you buy the car from the dealer before you sell it. It is not permissible for you to sell the car before you buy it, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade a man to sell that which is not in his possession\nYou should buy the car and move it from the showroom before you sell it. So it is not permissible for you to sell it when it is still in the showroom from which you bought it, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade selling goods where they were bought until the merchants bring them to their own places. Narrated by Abu Dawud (3499); classed as hasan by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud.\n\nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 36408 .']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/112520/he-buys-by-instalments-and-sells-by-instalments-for-a-higher-price
