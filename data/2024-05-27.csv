170174,"All the Abrahamic religions believe in one God and are awaiting their Messiah who is mentioned in their scriptures. So the Christians are awaiting the second coming of Jesus Christ, and the Jews are awaiting the Messiah son of David. As for you Muslims, you are awaiting two people at the same time, the Messiah Jesus son of Mary and the Awaited Mahdi. How can that be? Is it possible that these two figures refer to one man who is unique, meaning that the Mahdi is nothing more than another title for the Messiah son of Mary? If that is not so, then how do you explain that you are waiting for two messiahs at the same time?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe religion that Allah, may He be exalted, sent down is one religion, namely Islam. It is the religion of Noah (Nuh), Abraham (Ibrahim), Moses (Musa) and Jesus (‘Isa), a religion that is based on worshipping God alone with no partner or associate, and believing in all of His Messengers. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Indeed, the religion in the sight of Allah is Islam}\xa0[Al ‘Imran 3:19]\n{And whoever desires other than Islam as religion - never will it be accepted from him, and he, in the Hereafter, will be among the losers}\xa0[Aal ‘Imraan 3:85].\nAnd He tells us that Noah (Nuh – peace be upon him) said:\n{and I have been commanded to be of the Muslims}\xa0[Yoonus 10:72].\nAnd he tells us regarding Abraham (Ibrahim):\n{\xa0Abraham was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but he was one inclining toward truth, a Muslim [submitting to Allah ]. And he was not of the polytheists}\xa0[Al ‘Imran 3:67].\n{[It is] the religion of your father, Abraham. Allah named you “Muslims” before [in former scriptures]\xa0}\xa0[al-Hajj 22:78].\nAnd He says concerning Moses (Musa):\n{And Moses said, “O my people, if you have believed in Allah, then rely upon Him, if you should be Muslims.”}\xa0[Yoonus 10:84].\nAnd He says tells us that Joseph (Yusuf) said:\n{Cause me to die a Muslim and join me with the righteous}\xa0[Yoosuf 12:101].\nBut the deviant Christians drifted away from monotheism and fell into polytheism; they worshipped Jesus and his mother and disbelieved in the final Messenger who was foretold by Jesus (peace be upon him) in the Gospel (Injil).\nSecondly:\nThe Muslims believe that at the end of time, there will be a righteous man whose name is al-Mahdi. He will unite them and lead them, and he will be a precursor to the descent of Jesus son of Mary (peace be upon him). What is so strange about the fact that the Muslims are waiting for two people and not one person? One of them is a righteous man, one of the leaders of the Muslims, namely the Mahdi, and the other is a Prophet, one of the Messengers of strong will, namely Jesus (peace be upon him).\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The three nations are all expecting an awaited one who will emerge at the end of time, for he is promised in each religion. The Muslims are awaiting the descent of the Messiah Jesus son of Mary from heaven, to break the cross, kill the pigs and kill his enemies among the Jews and those among the Christians who worship him. And they are awaiting the emergence of the Mahdi, who will be one of the descendants of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him); he will fill the earth with justice as it was filled with injustice.""(Ighathat al-Lahfan\xa0 2/338).\nAl-Bukhari (2222) and Muslim (155) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “By the One in Whose hand is my soul, soon the Son of Maryam will descend among you as a just ruler, he will break the cross, kill the pigs and abolish the jizyah, and wealth will become so abundant that no one will accept it.”\nIn the hadith of Jaabir ibn ‘Abdillah (may Allah be pleased with him), it says: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: Jesus son of Mary will come down, and their leader the Mahdi will say: ‘Come and lead us in prayer.’ But he will say: ‘No; their leader should be from among them,’ by way of Allah honouring this ummah.”\nNarrated by al-Harith ibn Abi Usamah in his Musnad. Ibn al-Qayyim said in al-Manar al-Munif (1/147): Its isnad is jayyid (good).\nThe origin of this hadith appears in Sahih Muslim without naming the leader, as it says: “… Then ‘Isa ibn Maryam (peace be upon him) will descend and their leader will say: ‘Come and lead us in prayer.’ But he will say: ‘No; their leader should be from among them,’ by way of Allah honouring this ummah.” Narrated by Muslim (225).\nThis indicates that the Mahdi will come before Jesus, and that Jesus (peace be upon him) will pray behind him. Then Jesus (peace be upon him) will become the ruler after he kills the Dajjal, who is the false messiah whom the Jews are awaiting.\nThus the Muslims are awaiting the true Messiah, who was not killed or crucified; the Christians are awaiting the imaginary messiah who was killed, crucified and buried; and the Jews are awaiting the false messiah, the Dajjal, whom Allah will cause to be killed at the hand of Jesus son of Mary (peace be upon him).\nThe Sunnah also indicates that that the people of Gog and Magog (Ya’juj and Ma’juj) will be destroyed in answer to the prayer of Jesus (peace be upon him); thus the earth will be cleansed of the polytheists and disbelievers, and there will be no one left except the monotheists and believers.\nIn Sahih Muslim (2937), after mention of the tribulation of the Dajjal, it says: “Then whilst he is like that, Allah will send the Messiah son of Maryam, who will descend to the white minaret in the east of Damascus, wearing two garments lightly perfumed with saffron, placing his hands on the wings of two angels. When he lowers his head drops of water will come quickly from it and when he raises it, slow drops like pearls will fall. Every disbeliever whom his breath reaches will die, and his breath will reach as far as he can see. He will pursue him [the Dajjal] until he catches up with him at the gate of Ludd (Lod), and kills him. Then some people whom Allah has protected will come to ‘Isa ibn Maryam, and he will wipe their faces and inform them of their ranks in Paradise. Whilst they are like that, Allah will reveal to ‘Isa: I have brought forth some slaves of Mine against whom no one will be able to fight; take My slaves to safety in at-Toor [Sinai]. And Allah will send Ya’juj and Ma’juj, who will swarm down from every slope. The first of them will pass by the Lake of Tiberias and will drink what is in it, and the last of them will pass it and say: There was once water here. Then the Prophet of Allah ‘Isa and his companions will be besieged until the head of the bull of one of them will be better than one hundred dinars for one of you today. The Prophet of Allah ‘Isa and his companions will beseech [Allah], and Allah will send worms in their necks, and they will all perish as one in the morning. Then the Prophet of Allah ‘Isa and his companions will come down to the earth and they will not find a spot the size of a handspan on earth that is not filled with their putrefaction and stench. The Prophet of Allah ‘Isa (A) and his companions will beseech Allah, and Allah will send birds like the necks of Bactrian camels which will carry them and throw them wherever Allah wills. Then Allah will send rain which will not be kept out by any house of clay or hair; it will wash the earth and leave it like a mirror. Then it will be said to the earth: Bring forth your fruits and restore your blessing. On that day a group of people will eat from a pomegranate and shelter beneath its skin. Milk will be blessed until a milch-camel will be sufficient for a multitude of people, and a milch-cow will be sufficient for a tribe of people, and a milch-sheep will be sufficient for a clan of people. Then whilst they are like that, Allah will send a pleasant wind which will cause them pain beneath their armpits and will take the soul of every believer and every Muslim. The most evil of people will be left and they will fornicate like donkeys, and upon them the Hour will come.”\nFor a description of the Mahdi please see the answer to question no. 2937.\nThirdly:\nWhat is more important than finding out about the future is rectifying the present, by learning about the true religion and following it.\nWe believe that the true religion is Islam; it is a religion that does not differentiate between the Messengers or exaggerate about any one of them. If you become Muslim, you will believe in Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad. It is a religion that is based on sound human nature. Three cannot be one, and the true religion of Islam cannot attribute bad things to God the Creator or to the best of His Prophets, as the Jews do.\nThe evidence for the soundness of Islam is uncountable. In the Bible – despite its distortion – there is a great deal of evidence for that. For more information, please see the answers to questions no. 44018 and 101572 .\nWe advise you to do two things:\nFirstly: turn to your Creator and ask Him to guide you to the true religion, open your heart to guidance and show you the path of salvation.\nSecondly: read the Holy Quran and try to learn about Islam and what it calls people to. Try to be unbiased, like one who is seeking the truth and striving for it.\nFor our part, we ask Allah, may He be exalted, to open your heart, illuminate your path, guide you to Him, show you the path that leads to Him, choose for you His religion and make you one of the pious who are blessed in this world and the hereafter.\nWe would be happy to correspond with you and answer your questions.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/170174/are-the-muslims-awaiting-the-mahdi-or-the-messiah
25803,"If my pet cat walks in front of me or sits in front of me while I'm praying, what must I do? Should I carry on or cut off and keep it away?","['Praise be to Allah.What invalidates prayer if it passes in front of you?\nPrayer is invalidated if one of three things mentioned by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) walks in front of the worshipper . He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Prayer is invalidated by a woman, a donkey or a dog ; that may be prevented by something equal in height to the back of a saddle [placed in front of the worshipper as a sutrah or screen].” (Narrated by Muslim, 511)\xa0\nAccording to one report, “a black dog.” The narrator said: “I said, ‘O Abu Dharr, what is the difference between a black dog and a red or yellow dog?’ He said, ‘O son of my brother, I asked the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) the same question, and he said, “The black dog is a devil.”’” (Narrated by Muslim, 510)\xa0\nThis ruling applies if one of the things mentioned passes in front of the worshipper and he does not have a Sutrah or object to serve as a screen in front of him. But if he has a screen in front of him and the person or animal passes beyond that Sutrah, then his prayer is not affected, because of the Hadith of Abu Juhayfah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: “I heard my father narrating that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) led them in prayer in Al-Bat-ha’, and in front of them was an ‘Anzah (a short spear, iron-tipped at its lower end). He prayed two Rak`ahs for Dhuhr followed by two Rak`ahs for `Asr, and a woman and a donkey passed in front of him.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 495)\nThis ruling applies to the Imam and to one who is praying alone; with regard to the members of a congregation praying behind an Imam, the Sutrah of the Imam is also a Sutrah for them. Please refer to question no.\xa03404 .\xa0\nDo cats invalidate prayer if they pass in front of you?\nAs for cats , they do not invalidate the prayer even if they pass in front of you, because the basic guideline is that the prayer is valid, and there is no evidence to suggest that cats can invalidate the prayer.\xa0\nBut the worshipper should try hard to ensure that nothing passes in front of him. `Amr ibn Shu’ayb narrated from his father that his grandfather said: “We stopped with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in Thaniyyat Adhakhir and the time for prayer came, so he prayed facing a wall which lay in the direction of the Qiblah, and we were behind him. A lamb came and tried to pass in front of him and he kept pushing it back until its belly was pushed up against the wall, then it passed behind him.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 708; Al-Albani classed it as sound in Sahih Abu Dawud, 652)\xa0\nAre cats pure?\nCats are pure , and based on that, if a cat drinks from a vessel of water, the vessel does not become impure, because of the Hadith of Kabshah bint Ka’b ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with her), who was the wife of Abu Qatadah’s son, she said: “Abu Qatadah came in and I poured water for him to do Wudu. A cat came and drank some of the water so he tilted the vessel to let it drink. He saw me looking at him and said, ‘Do you find it strange, O daughter of my brother?’ I said, ‘Yes.’ He said, ‘The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said that they are not impure, rather they are among those who go around amongst you.’” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 92; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Tirmidhi)\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/25803/do-cats-invalidate-the-prayer-if-they-pass-in-front-of-you
487991,"Some time ago, I felt that I did not believe in God, and that Orthodox Christianity does not exist as a religion as far as I am concerned. But after that, I began to examine some other religions and sects, such as Babism, Buddhism and Islam. I would like someone to educate me about Islam, because I do not know where to start before accepting Islam. Can I, as an Orthodox Christian, go to the mosque and speak to the imam after the prayer ends? I am worried in case my relatives become suspicious of me, because my father criticised Islam and he is an atheist, and my father’s relatives are Korean Orthodox, but they respect Buddhist traditions. It will be very embarrassing for me to say that I am going to move to South Korea and at the same time tell them that I have embraced Islam.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nWe praise Allah, may He be exalted, for having enabled you to take an interest in Islam, and we ask Him to complete the blessing He has bestowed upon you by enabling you to accept Islam, feel at ease with it and enter the faith. This is an immense blessing from Allah, may He be exalted, to a person; in fact it is the greatest of His blessings, because it leads to happiness in this world and the hereafter.\nWe ask Allah, may He be exalted, to guide you to the straight path, increase you in guidance and steadfastness, and complete the blessing that He has bestowed upon you. We Muslims would welcome you as an honoured guest in any of our mosques, anywhere in the world, and you can sit with the imam, ask him whatever you want to ask him and listen to him. You will see how you will be welcomed and honoured in a way that you never expected, because we Muslims love goodness and guidance for all people, and we would love all people to believe in Allah and have sound faith in Him so that they may attain His pleasure, and Allah will reward them with paradise in the hereafter.\nSecondly:\nTo sum up Islam in a few words, it means obeying Allah, may He be exalted, and worshipping Him alone, with no partner or associate.\nAllah, may He be exalted, is the only Creator and Provider and He alone is in control of all things.\nAllah, may He be exalted, is the only one Whom people should worship, so no one is to be worshipped except Allah; no prophet, no angel, no jinni, no human, no rock, no tree, nothing is to be worshipped except Him.\nJust as Allah alone is the Creator Who is in control of all things, He alone is to be worshipped.\nIf you would like us to quote a brief verse which sums up all of Islam for you, it is the verse in which the Lord of the Worlds says in His holy Book (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Say, “Indeed, my prayer, my rites of sacrifice, my living and my dying are for Allah, Lord of the worlds\nNo partner has He. And this I have been commanded, and I am the first [among you] of the Muslims.”}\xa0[al-An‘am 6:162-163].\nIt was narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Islam is built on five (pillars): testimony that there is no god worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger, establishing regular prayer, paying zakah, pilgrimage to the House and fasting Ramadan.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (8) and Muslim (16).\nAccording to another report narrated by Muslim: “Islam is built on five (pillars): affirming the Oneness of Allah (Tawhid)…” What is meant by affirming the oneness of Allah is testifying that there is no god worthy of worship except Allah alone, with no partner or associate, and that Muhammad is His slave and His Messenger.\nAccording to another report also narrated by Muslim: “Islam is built on five (pillars): worshipping Allah and rejecting all false gods…” Affirming the oneness of Allah also means that we worship Him alone, with no partner or associate. That requires disbelieving in and rejecting all false gods that worshipped besides Allah, otherwise we are not affirming His oneness.\nThirdly:\nPeople cannot know the laws and rulings in accordance with which Allah wants them to worship Him, because they do not receive them from Him directly. Therefore Allah chose the best of humanity, namely the prophets and messengers, and made them intermediaries between Him and His creation in conveying His laws and rulings.\nThe prophets began with the father of humanity, Adam (peace be upon him) and ended with our Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). In between there came a large number of prophets, such as Noah (Nuh), Abraham (Ibrahim), Moses (Moosa), Jesus (‘Isa) and others, blessings and peace of Allah be upon them all.\nAll of them were human, and they only came to call people to worship Allah alone. None of them said that he was divine or the son of God, for such notions are associating others with Allah, and that is contrary to the message with which Allah sent them.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{ It is not for a human [prophet] that Allah should give him the Scripture and authority and prophethood and then he would say to the people, “Be servants to me rather than Allah,” but [instead, he would say], “Be pious scholars of the Lord because of what you have taught of the Scripture and because of what you have studied.”\nNor could he order you to take the angels and prophets as lords. Would he order you to disbelief after you had been Muslims? }\xa0[Al ‘Imran 3:79-80].\nAs affirming the oneness of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, and worshipping Him alone, with no partner or associate, is the essential message of all the prophets, Allah, may He be exalted, explained that to His slaves in their scriptures, and He drew their attention to sound evidence which confirms that in what they see around them. There are also significant verses in the Book of Allah which draw people’s attention to what they see in the universe around them; these verses remind them that Allah is the only Bestower of these blessings, the only Creator thereof, therefore they must believe that He alone is God of this universe. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{ Say, [O Muhammad], “To whom belongs the earth and whoever is in it, if you should know?”\nThey will say, “To Allah.” Say, “Then will you not remember?”\nSay, “Who is Lord of the seven heavens and Lord of the Great Throne?”\n\xa0They will say, “[They belong] to Allah.” Say, “Then will you not fear Him?”\nSay, “In whose hand is the realm of all things - and He protects while none can protect against Him - if you should know?”\nThey will say, “[All belongs] to Allah.” Say, “Then how are you deluded?”""\nRather, We have brought them the truth, and indeed they are liars.\nAllah has not taken any son, nor has there ever been with Him any deity. [If there had been], then each deity would have taken what it created, and some of them would have sought to overcome others. Exalted is Allah above what they describe [concerning Him].\n\xa0[He is] Knower of the unseen and the seen, so exalted be He above what they associate [with Him] }\xa0[al-Mu’minun 23:84-92].\nThere are other marvellous verses in the Book of the Lord of the Worlds which say that worshipping Allah alone, with no partner or associate, is the essential message of all the prophets, then after that, Allah mentions the misguidance of the polytheist Arabs and others who ascribe partners in divinity to Allah, such as the angels, the messengers or other created beings. These verses proved that to be false, and told them that the angels are honourable slaves who obey and submit to the Lord of the Worlds, and that the prophets (blessings and peace of Allah be upon them) were all human, created beings who die, and they are not divine at all. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{ And We sent not before you any messenger except that We revealed to him that, “There is no deity except Me, so worship Me.”\nAnd they say, “The Most Merciful has taken a son.” Exalted is He! Rather, they are [but] honored servants.\nThey do not speak until He has spoken, and they act by His command.\nHe knows what is [presently] before them and what will be after them, and they cannot intercede except on behalf of one whom He approves. And they, from fear of Him, are apprehensive.\nAnd whoever of them should say, “Indeed, I am a god besides Him”- that one We would recompense with Hell. Thus do We recompense the wrongdoers.\nHave those who disbelieved not considered that the heavens and the earth were a joined entity, and We separated them and made from water every living thing? Then will they not believe?\nAnd We placed within the earth firmly set mountains, lest it should shift with them, and We made therein [mountain] passes [as] roads that they might be guided.\nAnd We made the sky a protected ceiling, but they, from its signs, are turning away.\nAnd it is He who created the night and the day and the sun and the moon; all [heavenly bodies] in an orbit are swimming.\nAnd We did not grant to any man before you eternity [on earth]; so if you die - would they be eternal?\nEvery soul will taste death. And We test you with evil and with good as trial; and to Us you will be returned}\xa0[al-Anbiya’ 21:25-25].\nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 12628 .\nFourthly:\nAs for what the Orthodox Christians and others say, that Jesus is the son of God or that Jesus is God, this is one of the most grievous fabrications against Allah. Allah, may He be exalted, says in His holy Book (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And they say, “The Most Merciful has taken [for Himself] a son.”\nIndeed, you have uttered something atrocious.\nThe heavens almost rupture therefrom and the earth splits open and the mountains collapse in devastation,\nThat they attribute to the Most Merciful a son.\nAnd it is not appropriate for the Most Merciful that He should take a son.\nThere is no one in the heavens and earth but he comes to the Most Merciful as a servant\nHe has enumerated them and counted them a [full] counting,\nAnd all of them will come to Him on the Day of Resurrection alone}[Maryam 19:88-95].\nIt is invalid according to rational thinking, just as it is invalid because Allah, may He be exalted, has told us that He is one. How can Jesus be a son of God, when God has no wife? Exalted be Allah far above such a thing.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{[He is] Originator of the heavens and the earth. How could He have a son when He does not have a companion and He created all things? And He has full knowledge of all things}[al-An‘am 6:101].\nMoreover, how could Jesus be God or the son of God when he and his mother ate food as all people eat; they needed that and then they would have to deal with the consequences thereof, like any other people? Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{The Messiah, son of Mary, was not but a messenger; [other] messengers have passed on before him. And his mother was a supporter of truth. They both used to eat food. Look how We make clear to them the signs; then look how they are deluded}[al-Ma’idah 5:75].\nLook at what Allah, may He be exalted, says: {They both used to eat food}. These words rule out any notion of divinity for the Messiah and his mother.\nTo explain further:\nThe one who eats food needs that food, and if he did not eat he would feel the pain of hunger, and if his hunger intensified, he could die.\nDoes it make sense that God could need to eat, and if He did not eat, He would feel pain or die?\nMoreover, there is another meaning to this verse, which is that the one who eats food will be carrying impurity and the waste matter from that food in his body, and he will need to go to the bathroom and excrete it. Does it make sense to think that God, Who is Most Holy – meaning that He is far above all defects and shortcomings – could be carrying impurity and need to go to the bathroom?!\nFurthermore, the Christians believe that the Messiah came down and his enemies were able to capture him, beat him, spit in his face, torture him, crucify him and kill him. Can any rational mind accept that God would be helpless before His enemies and that they would be able to mistreat Him in such a way?\nFor more information, please see the answers to questions no. 82361 and 224199 .\nWe cannot discuss everything that has to do with Islam and Christianity in this brief answer – you can read what is available on this website about these topics – but it is sufficient that we have opened the way for you, and we encourage you to go to the mosque or Islamic centre that is closest to your house, where you will find answers to all your questions, if Allah wills.\nYou should note that entering Islam is not difficult. All that is needed is for you to say, “Ashhadu an la ilaha illa Allah wa ashhadu anna Muhammadan rasool Allah (I bear witness that there is no god worthy of worship except Allah and I bear witness that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah).” By doing so, you will be cleansed of all your previous sins, and you will start a new, blank page in your record of deeds, with no bad deeds; it will be as if you were born today.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Say to those who disbelieve that if they desist, what is past will be forgiven; but if they persist, then the precedent of the earlier peoples is already established}\xa0[al-Anfal 8:38].\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Islam erases that which came before it.”\nIn other words, it waives the punishment and removes the traces of previous sins.\nSo hasten to become Muslim, for this life may end suddenly; no one knows when death will come upon him.\nFifthly:\nAs for your fears regarding your relatives, you do not have to announce your Islam to them; rather you may conceal from them the fact that you have become Muslim. The companions of our Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in Makkah concealed their Islam from the polytheists of Makkah for fear that they might harm them and mistreat them.\nThen when you have the opportunity to tell them about your being Muslim later on, you can tell them and call your family to Islam, and strive to save them from the fire of hell.\nThis is a great favour that you can do for them. We ask Allah, may He be exalted, to guide you, support you and make you steadfast in faith.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/487991/an-orthodox-christian-wants-to-become-muslim-but-he-does-not-know-where-to-start
65731,"I know that it's not allowed to pray if you have ""Janabet"" Now if someone have prayed with ""Janabet"" then what is the ruling of Islam on him. Let me make the situation a little more clear.

Now in this situation the guy was not able to tell his dad that he is in ""Janabet"" and needs Ghusl, so he did the ""Wudu"" and conducted the jamat. Now from inside, he is totally broken, and worried about his SIN, he read in one book that if you conduct ""Salat"" without Wudu, then you are OUT OF ISLAM !!! .... Now in this situation what does he have to do ? Is he Out of ISLAM or NOT ? How he can overcome of his this SIM ... and do TOWBA ? Do he need to do his EMAN's TAJDEED ? I will be looking forward to hearing from your side, a detailed answer. I know that you have said that you ask only related to Ramadan questions, but I have discovered your site now. So I hope that when u will have time then u will reply to this IMPORTANT question. My friend is really in Mental Trouble due to what happened.","['Praise be to Allah.What happens if you deliberately pray without Wudu?\nIt is well known and no Muslim has any excuse for not knowing that purification from impurity, whether minor or major, is obligatory and is a condition of prayer being valid. Whoever prays without purifying himself , whether deliberately or by mistake, his prayer is invalid and he has to repeat it; if it is done deliberately then he has committed a major sin.\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“The Muslim should not pray facing any direction other than the Qiblah, or without doing Wudu , bowing and prostrating. Whoever does that deserves to be rebuked and punished.” (Minhaj As-Sunnah An-Nabawiyyah, 5/204\xa0)\nThere is a stern warning issued to one who does that. It was narrated from `Abdullah ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “It was ordered that one of the slaves of Allah be flogged in his grave with one hundred lashes, but he kept asking until it was reduced to a single blow. So he was given a single blow, then his grave was filled with fire. When he came round, he said: `Why did you flog me?` It was said to him: `You offered one prayer without being in a state of purity , and you passed by one who was being wronged and did not help him.`” (Narrated by At-Tahawi in Mushkil Al-Athar, 4/231; classed as sound by Al-Albani in As-Silsilah As-Sahihah, 2774)\xa0\nDoes praying without Wudu take one out of Islam?\nThe scholars agreed that whoever prays without being in a state of purity because he believes that it is permissible or out of disrespect is a disbeliever. He should be asked to repent, and if he repents, all well and good, otherwise he should be executed.\xa0\nBut if he prays without Wudu out of negligence, not because he thinks it is permissible or out of disrespect, Imam Abu Hanifah (may Allah have mercy on him) is of the view that this is also disbelief. However, the majority of scholars are of the view that he is not a disbeliever, rather he has committed a major sin.\xa0\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \xa0\n“If he knows that he is impure and that it is prohibited to pray when one is impure , then he has committed a grave sin, but he does not become a disbeliever thereby in our view, unless he regards that as permissible. But Abu Hanifah said: He has committed disbelief because of his disrespect.\xa0\nOur evidence is that it is a sin so it is akin to zina and the like.” (Al-Majmu` (2/84); Rawdat At-Talibin, 10/67)\n(See the Hanafi view in Al-Bahr Ar-Ra`iq, 1/302, 151; 5/132; Hashiyat Ibn `Abidin, 3/719)\nThe one who has prayed without purifying himself has to repent and seek forgiveness, and resolve not to do such a thing again, then he should repeat the prayer that he offered without purifying himself. Allah accepts the repentance of those who repent to Him. And he does not have to enter Islam anew.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/65731/what-happens-if-you-deliberately-pray-without-wudu
