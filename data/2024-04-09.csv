468827,"We live in a very rundown house that belongs to the state, and at any moment or any day now it will be demolished, because it belongs to the state. My father is stingy and does not want to rent or buy a house. Please note that his salary is high and he could afford that. My mother has been taking money from him without his knowledge, and she collected a sum of money and bought a piece of agricultural land for us to live on. Is this land haram? Please note that our house is very run down and belongs to the state.","[""Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nA house is something essential for humans, and if the father has provided accommodation for his wife and children to live in like that of their peers, then he is not obliged to do anything further from an Islamic point of view, unless he wants to buy a bigger house for them, if he can afford that. This is something that is recommended and encouraged according to Islamic teachings. It was narrated that Nafi‘ ibn ‘Abd al-Harith (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Part of a man’s happiness is a good neighbour, a comfortable means of transportation and a spacious house.” Narrated by Ahmad (15409); classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami‘ (3029).\nSo long as he is providing them with accommodation that is appropriate for them, even if that is by renting, or it is something granted by the government for them to live in, then the requirement is met, and owning the house one lives in is not a necessity or urgent need, so long as accommodation is available to him by renting or as a gift or loan.\nSecondly:\nIf the husband is spending on obligatory maintenance such as accommodation, clothing, food and drink, within reasonable limits, then it is not permissible for his wife to take anything from his money, because it is haram to take a person’s wealth without his willing consent, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{O you who have believed, do not consume one another's wealth unjustly but only [in lawful] business by mutual consent}\xa0[an-Nisa’ 4:29].\nAnd the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Indeed your blood, your wealth and your honour are sacred to you, as sacred as this day of yours, in this month of yours, in this land of yours. Let the one who is present convey it to the one who is absent.” Al-Bukhari (67).\nAnd he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “It is not permissible to take a man’s wealth except with his willing consent.” Ahmad (20172); classed as sahih by al-Albani in Irwa’ al-Ghalil (1495).\nBased on the above:\nWhat your mother collected from your father’s money and bought land with it does not come under the heading of wealth that it is permissible to take without the husband’s knowledge, because the wealth that it is permissible for a wife to take without the knowledge of her husband is limited to when he is failing to provide basic necessities.\nBut as this has already happened, it is essential to tell the father and put this land in his name and under his possession, if the father is still alive.\nIf it was bought in your mother’s name or in the name of one of you, then that must be changed, even if that is by means of a sale to the father.\nIf your father has passed on, then the house becomes part of his estate which is to be divided among the heirs, unless you all agree on something specific with the consent of all the heirs.\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/468827/what-is-the-ruling-on-taking-from-the-husbands-wealth-without-his-knowledge-to-buy-a-house-for-the-family
8868,What is the ruling on sisters making Salah in public?,"[""Praise be to Allah.Is it better for a woman to pray at home?\nِA woman should be protected and concealed from men as much as her guardian can do that. The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) preferred for women to pray in their houses and said that their reward for doing so is greater than their reward for praying in the mosque .\xa0\nIt was narrated from `Abdullah ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “A woman's prayer in her room is better than her prayer in her courtyard, and her prayer in her cabinet is better than her prayer in her room.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 570; At-Tirmidhi, 1173. This Hadith was classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Targhib wat Tarhib, 1/136).\xa0\n“Her room” refers to a woman`s own room in the house, and “her courtyard” refers to the central area (in a traditional Arabic house), off which all the rooms of the house open.\xa0\nA cabinet is like a small room inside the large room, in which personal items are stored. (Commentary from `Awn Al-Ma`bud).\xa0\nIt was narrated that Umm Humayd (may Allah be pleased with her) the wife of Abu Humayd As-Sa`idi (may Allah be pleased with him) came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said, “O Messenger of Allah, I like to pray with you.” He said, “I know that you like to pray with me, but your prayer in your room is better for you than your prayer in your courtyard and your prayer in your courtyard is better for you than your praying in your house, and your prayer in your house is better for you than your prayer in the mosque of your people, and your prayer in the mosque of your people is better for you than your prayer in my mosque.” So she issued orders that a prayer-place be prepared for her in the furthest and darkest part of her house, and she used to pray there until she met Allah (i.e., died).”\xa0(Narrated by Ahmad, 26550)\nThis Hadith was classed as authentic by Ibn Khuzaymah in his Sahih, 3/95; Ibn Majah, 5/595; Al-Albani in Sahih At-Targhib wat Tarhib, 1/135\xa0\nIt was narrated that `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “If the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had lived to see how women have started to behave, he would have prevented them [from going to the mosque] as the women of the Children of Israel were prevented.” I said, to `Umrah, “Were they prevented?” He said, “Yes.”\xa0 (Al-Bukhari, 831; Muslim, 445)\xa0\n`Abd Al-`Adhim Abadi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“The reason why their praying in their homes is better is because it is safer from temptation. This was later borne out by the way in which women began to make a wanton display of their adornments, hence `A`ishah said what she said.” (`Awn Al-Ma`bud, 2/193)\xa0\nCan women pray in public places?\nHence women should be careful when praying in public places, or go far away from where men can see them , and should not pray in a public place when the time of prayer comes, unless she has no other place in which to pray. \xa0\nShaykh `Abullah Al-Jibrin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“With regard to women, their houses are better for them. If they need to pray in the marketplace and there is a place that is screened off , there is nothing wrong with them praying there, in sha Allah.” (Fatawa Al-Mar`ah Al-Muslimah, 1/333)\xa0\nBut what some of the common people say, that a woman`s prayer is invalidated just because a man happens to see her, has no basis in Shari`ah at all. Women used to pray at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in one mosque and he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not rule their prayer to be invalid.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/8868/is-it-better-for-a-woman-to-pray-at-home
480298,,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nTakbir for the prostration of recitation in the prayer is a matter concerning which scholarly views differ, and there is no proven hadith text which speaks specifically about it. The majority of scholars are of the view that the worshipper should say takbir for the prostration of recitation when going down into prostration and when rising from it.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf someone does the prostration of recitation, he should say takbir for prostrating and for rising from it, whether in prayer or otherwise. This is the view of Ibn Sirin, al-Hasan, Abu Qilabah, an-Nakha‘i, Muslim ibn Yasar, Abu ‘Abd ar-Rahman as-Sulami, ash-Shafa‘i, Ishaq, and ashab ar-ra’y.\nMalik said: That is if he is praying; it is different if he is not praying.\nWhat supports our view is the report narrated by Ibn ‘Umar, who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to recite Qur’an for us, and if he came to a sajdah, he would say takbir and prostrate, and we would prostrate with him…\nMoreover, because it is an isolated prostration, it is prescribed to say takbir at the beginning of it and when rising from it, as is the case with the prostration of forgetfulness (sujud al-sahw) after the salaam.\nIt is proven that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said takbir in that case when prostrating and when rising from prostration.\nAl-Khiraqi did not mention saying takbir for rising from prostration, but it was mentioned by others among our companions, and it is an analogy, as we mentioned above.""(Al-Mughni\xa0 2/359).\nThe hadith of Ibn ‘Umar mentioned above was narrated by Abu Dawud, no. 1413, via ‘Abd ar-Razzaq, who said: ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar [al-‘Umari] told us, from Nafi‘, from Ibn ‘Umar, who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to recite Qur’an to us, and if he came to a sajdah, he would say takbir and prostrate, and we would prostrate with him.\nThis hadith was deemed to be da‘if (weak) by a number of scholars, because its isnad includes ‘Abdullah al-‘Umari, who is regarded as da‘if. His brother ‘Ubaydullah – who is trustworthy and reliable, and one of the most reliable and trustworthy narrators from Nafi‘ – disagreed with him. He narrated this hadith without any mention of takbir, as was narrated by al-Bukhari (1075) and Muslim (575), from ‘Ubaydillah ibn ‘Umar, who said: Nafi‘ told me, that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to recite Qur’an for us, and if he came to a sajdah, he would prostrate, and we would prostrate with him, until one of us could not find a space for his forehead.\nShaykh al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) said, regarding the isnad of the hadith narrated by Abu Dawud:\nThis is a layyin (“soft”) isnad – as al-Hafiz said in Bulugh al-Maram – and the problem with it is that ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar [al-‘Umari] is da‘if. Al-Bayhaqi did not comment on it, and Ibn al-Turkmani commented on that lack of comment in al-Jawhar an-Naqi where he said: Its isnad includes ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar, the brother of ‘Ubaydillah, about whom there is some criticism. Ibn al-Madini classed him as da‘if and Yahya ibn Sa‘id did not narrate from him. Ibn Hanbal said: He used to add to isnads. Salih ibn Muhammad said: He is layyin and is confused in his narration of hadith.\nI say: His brother ‘Ubaydullah, who was trustworthy, differed from him. He narrated something similar from Nafi‘ but did not mention takbir, as noted above in the hadith before it. This indicates that the mention of takbir in this report is something odd (munkar), according to the principles of ‘ilm al-hadith. And Allah knows best.""(Irwa’ al-Ghalil\xa02/224).\nRather the proof for it being prescribed to say takbir when doing the prostration of recitation in the prayer is to be found in the Prophet’s Sunnah, as the general meaning of some hadiths indicates that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to say takbir with every movement up or down in the prayer.\nFor example, it is narrated by al-Bukhari (785) and Muslim (392) from Abu Salamah ibn ‘Abd ar-Rahman, from Abu Hurayrah, that he used to lead them in prayer. He said takbir every time he moved up or down, and when he finished he said: I am the one among you whose prayer most closely resembles that of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nAnd it was narrated by at-Tirmidhi (253) and others that ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to say takbir every time he moved up or down, to stand or sit, and so did Abu Bakr and ‘Umar.\nAt-Tirmidhi said: Regarding this issue, there are reports from Abu Hurayrah, Anas, Ibn ‘Umar, Abu Malik al-Ash‘ari, Abu Musa, ‘Imran ibn Husayn, Wa’il ibn Hujr and Ibn ‘Abbas. The hadith of ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud is a hasan sahih hadith, and the action of the Companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was based on that, including the action of Abu Bakr, ‘Umar, ‘Uthman, ‘Ali and others, and the action of the Tabi‘in who came after them. This is the practice of the majority of jurists and scholars. End quote.\nSecondly:\nShaykh al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) was of the view that the fact that there is no proven text that refers to saying takbir in this case indicates that it is not prescribed, and he regarded as\xa0 da‘if the report about takbir in the hadith of Ibn ‘Umar. Based on that, [in his view] there should be no takbir for the prostration of recitation, either when going down into prostration or when rising from it.\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) said, commenting on that in Fiqh as-Sunnah:\nWith regard to the prostration of recitation:\nThe words: “It was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to recite Qur’an for us, and if he came to a sajdah, he would say takbir and prostrate, and we would prostrate.” Narrated by Abu Dawud and al-Bayhaqi, and by al-Hakam, who said: It is sahih according to the conditions of al-Bukhari and Muslim.\nI [al-Albani] say: There are two points to be noted regarding it:\nThe first point is that this hadith is da‘if, because its isnad in Abu Dawud –\xa0 from whom al-Bayhaqi narrated it – includes ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar al-‘Umari, who is da‘if, as al-Hafiz said in at-Talkhis. Hence he said in Bulugh al-Maram: Its isnad has some softness in it. An-Nawawi said in al-Majmu‘:\nIts isnad is da‘if.\nIt was narrated from a number of the Sahabah that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) prostrated for recitation in many verses, on different occasions, and none of them mentioned that he said takbir for this prostration. Hence we are inclined to say that it is not prescribed to say this takbir. This is one of the views narrated from Imam Abu Hanifah (may Allah have mercy on him).""(Tamam al-Minnah fi’t-Ta‘liq ‘ala Fiqh as-Sunnah\xa0 p. 267).\nThus Shaykh al-Albani did not think that this takbir is Sunnah, either when going down into prostration or rising from it, because there is no text which specifically mentions it.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/480298/takbir-for-the-prostration-of-recitation-in-the-prayer
20009,It is the practice of my fellow Muslim women friends to wash their feminine pads used during menses before they would throw them away. Is it true that it is obligatory to do so even though we are using disposable feminine pads which we are not going to use again? A lot of cases of hysteria and other disturbances are being said to be caused by not washing the pads properly before throwing them away by those afflicted. They say that the devil of the jinn likes to eat menses blood left on unwashed pads and would then harm the one who didn’t wash it.,"['Praise be to Allah.None of the trustworthy scholars have stated that a woman has to wash her feminine rags or pads which may have traces of menstrual blood, if she is going to throw them away and not use them again. Rather it seems that the female Companions did not wash these pads; the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) knew about that and it is not narrated that he told them off for that.\xa0\nAt-Tirmidhi (61) and other authors of Sunan narrated that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “It was said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, should I do Wudu’ from the well of Buda`ah?’ – which was a well into which were thrown menstrual rags, the flesh of dogs and other putrid things. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Water is pure and nothing makes it impure.” This is an authentic Hadith which was classed as such by Ahmad, Yahya ibn Ma`in, Ibn Khuzaymah, Ibn Taymiyah and others (may Allah have mercy on them).\xa0\nWhat is referred to here by “menstrual rags” is the rags which were used for menstrual blood, as Al-Mubarakfuri (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his commentary on this Hadith. So it seems that they used to throw them away when they were contaminated with blood, otherwise the Companions would not have raised the issue of whether the water into which these rags were thrown was pure or not.\xa0\nThere is no sound basis for what your friends have said; rather it is a myth which has no basis. Such notions are widespread among the common folk, so you have to ask for proof and evidence, and refer to the scholars and books of knowledge. You have to reject these myths and warn people against them. Each person must protect himself against the evils of the devils among mankind and the jinn by remembering Allah a great deal (Dhikr), reciting Quran and adhering steadfastly to the commands of Shari`ah, and keeping away from myths and stories that have no proof.\nFor more details, please refer to the following\xa0 answers:\xa07776 ,\xa013948 , 1326 , and 44980 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20009/is-it-mandatory-in-islam-to-wash-used-sanitary-pads-before-throwing-them
