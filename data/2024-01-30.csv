149942,What is the ruling on men praying behind woman or in rows alongside their rows?,"['Praise be to Allah.What is prescribed is for the men to be in front of the woman, and for the woman to be behind the men in the mosque. Wherever the women pray behind the men, this is what is prescribed and is what is obligatory. But in cases of necessity, such as during the days of Hajj and during Hajj season, in al-Masjid an-Nabawi and in al-Masjid al-Haram, where women may be standing to the right or left of men, or in front of them, that does not affect the prayer of the men, so the men’s prayer is valid, even if the women are in front of them or on the left or on the right. As for what is Sunnah and what is prescribed and obligatory, the woman should be behind the men.\nShaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him).\nFatawa Nur ‘ala ad-Darb (2/919).']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/149942/ruling-on-men-praying-behind-woman-when-there-is-a-need-to-do-that
153894,What is the ruling on keeping a dog outside the house as a pet? What is meant by the loss of two qirats of one’s good deeds – does it mean that it is forbidden (haram) or disliked (makruh)?,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt is not permissible to keep a dog as a pet only, and it makes no difference whether the dog is kept inside the house or in a separate place outside the house.\nThis is indicated by the report which was narrated by al-Bukhari (5060) and Muslim (2941) from Ibn ‘Umar, according to which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever keeps a dog, except a dog for hunting or herding livestock, two qirats will be deducted from his reward every day.” According to another version: “Whoever keeps a dog, two qirats will be deducted from his good deeds every day…” al-Bukhari (2154) and Muslim (2949).\nAn-Nawawi said:\nOur companions and others are agreed that it is haram to keep a dog unnecessarily, such as if someone keeps it because he likes the way it looks, or to show off. This is prohibited, and there is no difference of opinion concerning that.""(Sharh Sahih Muslim\xa0 1/448).\nThat is because dogs are lowly and dirty animals, and because of the harm and negative consequences involved in keeping them; for example, they keep the angels away from the place where the dog is; they scare and frighten others; they are impure; and are dirty.\nIf there is a need for that, because of some benefits and interests that are served, such as guarding sheep from the danger of wolves and thieves, or keeping them for farming purposes, or using them for hunting, then these benefits justify keeping a dog, and there is no blame on the one who does that.""(Taysir al-‘Allam Sharh ‘Umdat al-Hukkam\xa0 2/209).\nPlease see also the answers to questions no. 33668 and 69777 .\nSecondly:\nMost of those who commented on this hadith are of the view that the Prophet’s words “two qirats will be deducted from his reward every day” indicate that it is haram.\nNone of the scholars disagreed with that, as far as we know, except Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr among the leading scholars of hadith, and the Maliki scholars. He was of the view that the hadith indicates that keeping dogs is disliked (makruh), but not haram.\nIbn ‘Abd al-Barr said:\nThis hadith indicates that keeping dogs is not haram, even if they are kept for purposes other than farming, herding and hunting, because the words “two qirats will be deducted from his reward every day” indicate that it is permissible, not prohibited, because it cannot be said of prohibited things that whoever does this thing, such and such will be detracted from his good deeds or from his reward. Rather, if it was prohibited, the Lawgiver would have prohibited it in clear terms, so that the Muslim would not do any such thing. Rather this wording indicates that it is disliked (makruh), not prohibited (haram).""(Al-Istidhkar al-Jami‘ li Madhahib Fuqaha’ al-Ansar\xa0 9/450).\nThis a view of Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr is a weak view, which more than one of the scholars have commented on.\nAl-Hafiz al-‘Iraqi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: His view is strange, because our conclusion that it is haram is based on that detraction from the reward, for that indicates that he has done something that is prohibited, which nullifies the reward of some of his good deeds, just as the non-acceptance of prayers from one who drinks alcohol, a runaway slave and one who goes to a fortune teller or soothsayer (as mentioned in other hadiths) indicates that these actions are prohibited. The fact that they are prohibited is the reason why the reward for prayer is nullified in these cases.\nAnd he said: The reason why the wording of the hadith indicates that it is prohibited is very clear, because detraction from reward can only come about because of the sin that one has committed.""(Tarh al-Tathrib\xa0 6/173).\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar said: What is claimed, that it is not haram based on the argument that he stated, is not sound. Rather it is possible that the punishment could come in the form of no longer being enabled to do a qirat’s worth of righteous deeds that he used to do, when he did not keep a dog.\nAnd it is possible that keeping a dog is haram, and what is meant by detracting from the reward is that the sin that results from keeping the dog is equivalent to one or two qirats of reward, so what is detracted from the reward of the dog owner’s righteous deeds is equivalent to the sin incurred by keeping the dog, which is one or two qirats.""(Fath al-Bari\xa0 5/7).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/153894/ruling-on-keeping-a-dog-outside-the-house-as-a-pet
178639,We know the Hadith of the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) about the rights of one Muslim over another.,"['Praise be to Allah.Will you be sinning if you fail to fulfil one of the rights of another Muslim?\nThe rights that one Muslim has over another are many; some of which are individual obligations that are required of each person, and if he fails to do them he is sinning. Others are communal obligations; if some people do them, the burden of sin is waived for the rest. And some are encouraged but not obligatory, so the Muslim is not sinning if he does not do them.\xa0\nHow many rights does a Muslim have over another Muslim?\nAl-Bukhari (1240) and Muslim (2162) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “The rights of one Muslim over another are five: returning the greeting of Salam, visiting the sick, attending funerals, accepting invitations, and saying Yarhamuk Allah (may Allah have mercy on you) to one who sneezes.”\xa0\nAnd Muslim (2162) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The rights of one Muslim over another are six.” It was said: What are they, O Messenger of Allah? He said: “If you meet him, greet him with Salam; if he invites you, accept the invitation; if he asks for advice, give him sincere advice; if he sneezes and praises Allah, say Yarhamuk Allah (may Allah have mercy on you); if he falls sick, visit him; and if he dies, attend his funeral.”\xa0\nAsh-Shawkani (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “What is meant by the words “The rights of the Muslim” is that they should not be omitted and doing them is either obligatory, or encouraged to such an extent that it is very similar to being obligatory and should not be omitted. The word “right” (Haqq) may be used in the sense of obligatory, as was mentioned by Ibn Al-`Arabi.” (Nayl Al-Awtar, 4/21)\xa0\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Returning the greeting of Salam is obligatory if the greeting is given to one person. If it is given to a group, then it is obligatory upon the group (Fard Kifayah or communal obligation; if one of the group returns the greeting, the obligation has been met). With regard to initiating the greeting, the basic principle is that it is encouraged.\xa0\nIt says in Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah (11/314):\xa0\n“Initiating the greeting is Sunnah Mu’akkadah (a confirmed Sunnah) because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Spread the greeting of Salam amongst yourselves.” It is obligatory to return the greeting if it is given to one person. If the greeting is given to a group, then in their case responding is a Fard Kifayah (communal obligation); if one of them responds the sin is waived from the others, but if they all respond, they have all done what is required, Whether they respond all together or one after another. If they all refrain from responding, then they are all sinning because of the report which says: “The rights of one Muslim over another are five: returning (the greeting) of Salam…”\xa0\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Visiting the sick it is a communal obligation .\xa0\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0“Visiting the sick is a Fard Kifayah (communal obligation).” (Majmu` Fatawa wa Rasa’il Ibn `Uthaymin, 13/1085)\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Attending funerals is also a Fard Kifayah (communal obligation).\xa0\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 With regard to accepting invitations , if the invitation is to a wedding feast, then the majority of scholars are of the view that it is obligatory to accept unless there is a legitimate Shar‘i reason not to do so. If it is for something other than a wedding feast, the majority are of the view that it is encouraged. But there are conditions for accepting invitations in general terms.\xa0\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 With regard to saying Yarhamuk Allah (May Allah have mercy on you) to one who sneezes, there is a difference of opinion concerning the ruling.\xa0\nIt says in Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah, 4/22:\xa0\n“This saying Yarhamuk Allah (May Allah have mercy on you) is encouraged according to the Shafa`is.\xa0\nAccording to the Hanbalis and the Hanafis, it is obligatory.\xa0\nThe Malikis said – and it is also an opinion among the Hanbalis – that it is a communal obligation. It was narrated from Al-Bayan that the stronger view is that it is an individual obligation (Fard ‘Ayn), because of the Hadith: “It is the duty of every Muslim who hears him (the one who sneezes) to say: Yarhamuk Allah (may Allah have mercy on you).\nThe more correct opinion is that it is obligatory on the one who hears the sneezer praise Allah (by saying “Al-hamdu Lillah”), because of the report narrated by Al-Bukhari (6223) from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) who said: “Allah likes the act of sneezing and dislikes the act of yawning, so if any one of you sneezes and praises Allah (says ‘Al-hamdu Lillah’), it is a duty on every Muslim who hears him to say to him, ‘Yarhamuk Allah (may Allah have mercy on you).’”\xa0\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“We have quoted above the Hadith of Abu Hurayrah, in which it says: “if any one of you sneezes and praises Allah (says ‘Al-hamdu Lillah’), it is a duty (Haqq) on every Muslim who hears him to say to him, ‘Yarhamuk Allah (may Allah have mercy on you).”. At-Tirmidhi included the Hadith of Anas under the heading: Chapter on what was narrated about it being obligatory to say Yarhamuk Allah (may Allah have mercy on you) when one who sneezes says Al-hamdu Lillah (Praise be to Allah). This indicates that it is obligatory in his view, and this is the correct view, because of the Hadiths that clearly indicate that it is obligatory and there was nothing to contradict that, and Allah knows best.\xa0\nOne of them is the Hadith of Abu Hurayrah mentioned above, and another is his other Hadith, “There are five (rights) that the Muslim has over his brother,” which is also mentioned above. Another is the Hadith of Salim ibn ‘Ubayd, in which it says: “Let those who are with him say to him: Yarhamuk Allah (may Allah have mercy on you).” And another is the report narrated by At-Tirmidhi from ‘Ali who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The Muslim has six (rights) over his fellow-Muslim: he should greet him with Salam when he meets him; he should respond when he invites him; he should say Yarhamuk Allah (may Allah have mercy on you) if he sneezes; he should visit him if he falls sick; he should attend his funeral if he dies; and he should love for him what he loves for himself.” He (At-Tirmidhi) said: This is a sound Hadith. It was also narrated via another Isnad (chain of narration) from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Some of the scholars spoke negatively about Al-Harith Al-A‘war (one of the narrators). In the same chapter it is also narrated from Abu Hurayrah, Abu Ayyub, Al-Bara’ and Abu Mas‘ud. And another of these Hadiths is that which was narrated by At-Tirmidhi from Abu Ayyub, according to which the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If one of you sneezes, let him say Al-hamdu Lillah (praise be to Allah); and let him say ‘ala kulli hal (in all circumstances). And let the one who responds to him say: Yarhamuk Allah (may Allah have mercy on you). And let him say: Yahdikum Allahu wa yuslih balakum (May Allah guide you and set your affairs straight).\xa0\nThere are four kinds of proof in the Hadith quoted above (“if any one of you sneezes and praises Allah (says ‘Al-hamdu Lillah’), it is a duty (Haqq) on every Muslim who hears him to say to him, ‘Yarhamuk Allah (may Allah have mercy on you)”):\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 there is a clear statement that it is obligatory to say Yarhamuk Allah (may Allah have mercy on you), which cannot be interpreted in any other way;\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 it is made obligatory by use of the word Haqq (translated above as duty);\n3.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 it is made obligatory by use of the word ‘Ala (on). This word clearly means that it is obligatory\n4.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 it is enjoined. There can be no doubt that there are many duties that are proven to be obligatory on the basis of less evidence than this. And Allah knows best.” (Hashiyat Ibn Al-Qayyim ‘ala Sunan Abu Dawud, 13/259)\xa0\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) also said:\xa0\n“The apparent meaning of the Hadith mentioned above is that saying Yarhamuk Allah is an individual obligation upon everyone who hears the one who sneezed say Al-hamdu Lillah; it is not acceptable for just one of them to say it. This is one of the two scholarly opinions, which was favoured by the Malikis Ibn Abu Zayd and Abu Bakr ibn Al-‘Arabi, and it cannot be otherwise.” (Zad Al-Ma`ad, 2/437)\xa0\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 With regard to giving him advice if he asks for it, it is most likely that offering advice is a communal obligation.\xa0\nIbn Muflih (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“The apparent meaning of the words of Ahmad and our companions is that it is obligatory to offer advice to the Muslim , even if he does not ask for it, as is the apparent meaning of the reports.” (Al-Adab Ash-Shar‘iyyah by Ibn Muflih, 1/307)\xa0\nAl-Mullah `Ali Al-Qari (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“If he asks you for advice” means if he asks you for advice, then give it to him; it is obligatory. It is also obligatory to give advice even if he did not ask for it.” (Mirqat Al-Mafatih, 5/213)\xa0\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“It is clear that what is meant by “duty” (Haqq) here is that it is obligatory. This is different from the words of Ibn Battal who said that what is meant is the duty of respect and companionship. It seems that what is meant here is that it is a communal obligation.” (Fath Al-Bari, 3/113)\xa0\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 21878 and 65649\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/178639/is-failing-to-fulfil-one-right-of-a-muslim-a-sin
