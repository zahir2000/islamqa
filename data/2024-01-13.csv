218702,"What should I do, as I have a problem? Please advise me. I always offer all the prayers in the mosque, and I keep away from sins. I used to say tasbih (“Subhan Allah (Glory be to Allah”)) a great deal, and I tried to draw close to Him and prayed that He would make me one of His righteous slaves and bless me with a heart that trembles with fear of Him. I repeated this supplication approximately three times yesterday, and I spent the night in prayer (qiyam) and offered the same supplication. I thought positively of Allah and was certain of a response. But after spending the night in prayer, then sleeping on the following day, I felt distressed and could not recite tasbih, and I felt no sense of reassurance when remembering Allah. I became very sad and wept with sorrow. I think positively of Allah, but I said to myself: Why is it happening to me that I do not feel any sense of reassurance when remembering Allah? I began to weep and I said to myself: Why? What have I done? I tried to check myself, but I could not remember committing any sin. On the contrary, I remember Allah a great deal, but now I am unable to offer any supplication or recite any dhikr, and I am only praying regularly in the mosque. I have stopped spending the night in prayer (qiyam al-layl). What should I do now?","['Praise be to Allah.It should be understood that the more a person tries to draw close to Allah, the more the Shaytan will try to block his path in order to undermine his efforts and make his life difficult, and divert him from worshipping and obeying Allah, may He be exalted.\nSo the Muslim must strive to be patient and strive against his nafs and evil inclinations and against the Shaytan. He should offer a lot of supplication and beseech Allah, may He be exalted, to help him to remain steadfast.\nUpholding regular prayer, keeping away from haram things, remembering Allah a great deal, and seeking to draw close to Him by doing supererogatory (nafil) acts of worship – all of this is the straight path, which you must strive hard to adhere to and be patient in bearing its hardships.\nRemember the words of the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “A person will still be answered so long as his supplication does not involve sin or severing ties of kinship, and so long as he does not become impatient.” It was said: O Messenger of Allah, what does being impatient mean? He said: “Saying, I offered supplication, and I offered supplication, and I did not receive any response, then he becomes frustrated and stops offering supplication.” Narrated by Muslim (2735).\nSo do not say, “I remembered Allah a great deal, and I prayed and I spent the night in prayer, but my heart was not softened.” Rather you should strive hard in remembering Allah (dhikr), praying and spending the night in prayer (qiyam), until you attain what you are seeking.\nAs it is said: Whoever keeps knocking on the door, it will be opened to him; as for the one who knocks only once and goes away…\nYou should understand that what befalls you sometimes of grief, sadness, distress and lack of motivation is part of the Shaytan’s scheme that he uses against the believers to make them despondent. Once a person realizes that, and he becomes certain that it is the scheme of the Shaytan, then he will be on the alert and will seek refuge with Allah from that.\nAnd you should understand that the sweetness of faith and finding pleasure in the remembrance of Allah, may He be exalted, is something that the believer will never attain except after striving against his nafs and evil inclinations, and against the Shaytan. Hence one of the early generations said: I struggled to make myself read the Quran for twenty years, then I found pleasure in it for twenty years. Similarly, finding pleasure in the remembrance of Allah and obeying Him can only come after persisting in doing righteous deeds and striving hard for a long time, until the believer starts to taste the sweetness of faith.\nMay Allah help you to do that which He loves and is pleased with, and may He suffice you against the evil of your own self (nafs) and the evil of the Shaytan.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/218702/he-is-complaining-that-he-does-not-feel-reassurance-in-his-heart-when-remembering-allah-may-he-be-exalted
197199,"How did the Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) spend his day – an example of his daily life? Basically I want to understand the daily routine in the life of the Prophet. What did he do after Fajr prayer? How did he have his breakfast and when? What was his etiquette when eating? What did he do from noon until he went to sleep, and after Tahajjud? To sum up, I want to know the daily routine of Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).","[""Praise be to Allah.What did the Prophet do after Fajr?\nWhen the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) woke up, he would pray Fajr with his Companions in the mosque. Then he would sit in the place where he had prayed , remembering Allah until the sun rose, and his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) would sit with him. Sometimes they would talk and remember things that happened before Islam; they would laugh and he would smile.\xa0\nHow did Prophet Muhammad offer Duha prayer?\nThe Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) regularly offered Duha prayer with four or more Rak`ahs.\xa0\n`Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to pray Duha with four Rak`ahs or more, as Allah willed.\xa0(Narrated by Muslim, 719)\nWhat did Prophet Muhammad do in his house?\nIn his house, he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would be at the service of his family: he would milk his sheep, patch his garment, serve himself and mend his shoes. When the time for prayer came, he would go out and lead the people in prayer, then he would sit with them, talk with them, teach them, exhort them, remind them, listen to their complaints, and reconcile between them. Then he would go back to his house.\xa0\n`Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) was asked: What did the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) do in his house? She said: He was a human being like any other; he would clean his garment, milk his sheep and serve himself.\xa0(Narrated by Ahmad, 26194; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in As-Sahihah, 671)\nAccording to another report also narrated by Ahmad (24903): He used to stitch his garment, mend his shoes and work as other men work in their houses.\xa0(Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Al-Jaami`, 4937)\xa0\nAl-Bukhari (676) narrated that Al-Aswad said: I asked `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) what the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to do in his house. She said: He would serve his family, then when the time for prayer came, he would go out to the prayer.\xa0\nDid the Prophet never criticise any food?\xa0\nHe (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) never criticised any food; if he liked it he would eat it , otherwise he would leave it.\xa0\nSometimes month after month would go by, and he would not find any food except dates and water.\xa0\nAbu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) never criticised any food; if he liked it he would eat it, otherwise he would leave it.\xa0(Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 3563; Muslim, 2064)\xa0\n`Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: We would look at the new moon, then another new moon, three new moons in two months, and no fire would be lit in the houses of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). I – i.e., `Urwah ibn Az-Zubayr – said: O aunt, what did you live on? She said: The two black ones, dates and water. But the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) had some neighbours among the Ansar who had milch-animals, and they used to give the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) some of their milk, and he gave it to us to drink.\xa0\xa0(Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 2567; Muslim, 2972)\xa0\nHow many meals did the Prophet have a day?\nThere are no details in the Sunnah about the meals that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to eat.\xa0\nIt was not the custom of the Muslims in the earliest times to eat three meals every day as people do nowadays. Rather the most they would have would be two meals: one at the beginning of the day and another in the evening.\xa0\nHow did the Prophet gather the companions for important matters?\nIf he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) wanted to bring the people together for some important matter, he would instruct someone to bring them together for him or to call out among them “As-salatu jami`ah (prayer is about to begin)”, then he would talk to them about the reason he had brought them together. If he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) wanted to send a party out on a mission, he would send them; if he wanted to remind them of something, he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would remind them; if he wanted to tell them about a new ruling, he would tell them, and so on.\xa0\nDid the Prophet use to take a nap?\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would take a nap at midday, so that this siesta would give him strength to pray Qiyam Al-layl (voluntary prayers at night). He (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would say: “Take a nap at midday, for the satan does not take a nap at midday.” (Narrated by At-Tabarani in Al-Awsat, 28; classed as sound by Al-Albani in As-Sahihah, 1647)\xa0\nHow did Prophet Muhammad spend his day?\nHe (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would check on people in their daily lives and interactions, and in their marketplaces ; he would go and see them in the places where they gathered; he would visit their sick and accept their invitations; and he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would attend to the needs of the weak and poor. Thus he spent most of his day dealing with that which concerned him of matters of religion and the people’s affairs, such as calling people to Allah, advising them, reminding them, introducing rulings, striving in Jihad, enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil, helping the needy, and so on.\xa0\nMuslim (102) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) passed by a pile of foodstuff; he put his hand in it and found that it had gotten wet. He said, “What is this, O seller of the foodstuff?” He said: It got rained on, O Messenger of Allah. He said: “Why don’t you put it on top of the food so that people can see it? Whoever deceives (people) does not belong to me.”\xa0\nAl-Bayhaqi (20851) narrated that Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Let us go to Al-Basir who is in Banu Waqif and visit him (as he is sick).” He was a blind man.\xa0(Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in As-Sahihah, 521)\xa0\nAn-Nasa’i (1414) narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn Abi Awfa (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to recite words of Dhikr a great deal and rarely engaged in idle talk. He would make his prayer lengthy and his speeches short; he was not too proud to walk with widows and the needy in order to meet their needs.\xa0(Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih An-Nasa’i)\xa0\nWhat was Prophet Muhammad's night routine?\nWhen night came and he had led the people in praying `Isha’, if there was some matter on his mind concerning the Muslims’ affairs, he would discuss it with his senior companions; otherwise he would stay up with his family for a little while.\xa0\nImam Ahmad (178) and At-Tirmidhi (169 – and he classed it as sound) narrated that `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to stay up at night with Abu Bakr, discussing some of the Muslims’ affairs, and I would be with him.\xa0Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Tirmidhi\xa0\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“It was part of his character that he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) treated people kindly and was always cheerful. He would joke with his family and be gentle with them; he would spend generously on them and joke with his wives … His wives would gather every night in the house of the one with whom the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was staying that night, and sometimes he would eat supper with them, then each of them would go to her own house and he would sleep with the wife (in whose house he was staying the night) under one blanket; he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would take off his upper garment and sleep in his lower garment. When he had prayed ‘Isha’, he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would go into his house and stay up for a little while with his family before sleeping, to cheer them up; (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).”\xa0(Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 2/242)\xa0\nDid Prophet Muhammad sleep at night?\nHe would sleep at the beginning of the night , then get up to pray Qiyam Al-layl, and he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would pray as much as Allah willed that he should pray. Then when Bilal (may Allah be pleased with him) gave the call for Fajr prayer, he would pray two Rak`ahs, then go out to the prayer.\xa0\nAbu Dawud (56) narrated from `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that water for wudu’ and his Siwak would be set out for the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and when he woke up at night he would relieve himself, then clean his teeth with the Siwak.\xa0\nIt was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I stayed overnight with my maternal aunt Maymunah. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) conversed with his family for a while, then he went to sleep . Then when the last third of the night came, he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) sat up and looked at the sky and said: “Verily, in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and in the alternation of night and day, there are indeed signs for men of understanding” [Al ‘Imran 3:190]. Then he got up and did Wudu' and cleaned his teeth, and prayed eleven Rrak`ahs. Then Bilal gave the call to prayer, so he prayed two Rak`ahs, then he went out (to the mosque) and prayed Fajr.\xa0(Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 4569 and Muslim, 763)\nIn conclusion, the life of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was not a strict routine, as may be understood from these words. Rather it was purposeful and blessed work, as his Lord instructed him (interpretation of the meaning): “Say (O Muhammad): ‘Verily, my prayer, my sacrifice, my living, and my dying are for Allah, the Lord of the Alameen (mankind, jinns and all that exists)’” [Al-An`am 6:162].\xa0\nHis practice was to interpret in a realistic manner the commands and laws of Allah, as the Mother of the Believers `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said.\xa0\nMuslim narrated (746) that Sa‘d ibn Hisham ibn `Amir said to the Mother of the Believers `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her): O Mother of the believers, tell me about the character of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). She said: Do you not read the Quran? I said: Of course. She said: The character of the Prophet of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was the Quran.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/197199/how-did-prophet-muhammad-spend-his-day
439738,"I have been working for twenty-three years, and I am still working. For approximately fifteen years, my father used to take some of my salary to buy land with it and build on it. Please note that he is financially well off. He also used to pay most of the price from his own pocket, but that was so that he would be able to buy and build quickly. During this time, he registered some properties in my name, and he finished building on some of them. Because my father is sick, following a stroke, and is now cognitively impaired and not aware of anything, my question is: what is the ruling on these properties? Are they regarded as part of my father’s wealth? Please note that I have siblings, and now I am in charge of these properties. My second question is: I am now managing these properties, but I do not take any of his wealth; rather I am working to grow his wealth, and it takes up a lot of my time and energy. What you think about that?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nWhat you gave to your father is subject to discussion:\n1. If it was by way of a gift, then the properties all belong to your father, even if he registered some of them in your name.\nIt is not permissible to take back a gift, because of the report narrated by Abu Dawud (3539), at-Tirmidhi (2132), al-Nasa’i (3690) and Ibn Majah (2377) from Ibn ‘Umar and Ibn ‘Abbas from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) who said: “It is not permissible for a man to give a gift or a present then take it back, except in the case of what a father gives to his son. The likeness of the one who gives a gift then takes it back is that of a dog that eats then when it is full it vomits, then it goes back to its vomit.” This hadith was classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud.\n2. If that was a partnership, meaning that some of the property belongs to you, then if what he registered in your name is equivalent to what you gave, then those properties belong to you.\nBut if what he registered in your name is worth more than you are entitled to, the extra amount was a gift, but he has to be fair in giving gifts to his other children, unless your siblings agreed to that. If they did not agree to your receiving something extra, then it must be returned to your father’s wealth.\nSecondly:\nThe wealth of your father who is cognitively impaired and no longer aware of things must be kept and not spent on anything, except on his maintenance and the maintenance of those on whom he is obliged to spend.\nIn al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (45/162) it says: There is no difference of opinion among the jurists regarding the fact that it is not permissible for the guardian to dispose of the wealth of one who is legally incompetent except in the most careful and prudent manner, and in the manner that best serves his interests, because of the hadith: “There should be no harm and no reciprocating harm.”\nBased on that, they said: Handling the money in a manner that serves no interest for the legally incompetent person – such as giving gifts for nothing in return, making bequests on his behalf, giving charity on his behalf, manumitting a slave of his, or showing favouritism when selling – is something that the guardian has no right to do, and he is liable for whatever he gives as a gift or a charity, or for manumitting the slave, or showing favouritism when buying and selling, or if he spends more than is proper on maintenance, or he gives any of the wealth to someone who is not trustworthy, because he is giving away that which belongs to him without getting anything in return, so it is pure harm…\nThere is no difference of opinion among the jurists regarding the fact that the guardian must spend from the wealth of the person under his care on his maintenance and that of those on whom he is obliged to spend, on a reasonable basis, without being extravagant or stingy, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And who, when they spend, are neither extravagant nor stingy, but follow a middle path between the [two]}\xa0[al-Furqan 25:70].\nThe Shafa‘is and Hanbalis added: If he is stingy in spending on maintenance, he is sinning, and if he is extravagant, he is sinning, and he is liable for his negligence. End quote.\nThirdly:\nIt is permissible to take some payment on a reasonable basis for developing and growing the wealth, if that takes time and effort, provided that it is no more than the going rate for similar work, because the son is not obliged to work with his father or to develop his wealth.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/439738/his-father-used-to-take-some-of-his-salary-and-buy-property-with-it-then-he-became-cognitively-impaired-does-he-have-any-right-to-that-property
129635,How did the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) conclude his marriages? How was it done? How did he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) consummate the marriage offer feasts? What did he offer as Mahr (bridal money) in detail?,"[""Praise be to Allah.Prophet Muhammad’s Guidance on Marriage\nThe guidance of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) with regard to marriage was that he encouraged making it easy, announcing it and proclaiming it openly, and expressing joy and happiness on this occasion; making a wedding feast and inviting people to it; enjoining those who are invited to attend, and even if a person is fasting he should attend and offer Du`a’ for the host of the feast, but he does not have to eat.\xa0\nThen he enjoined treating the wife with kindness and trying one's best to achieve that.\xa0\nThis is in general terms. There follows a detailed discussion:\xa0\nAffordable dowry (Mahr)\xa0\nAl-Bayhaqi (14721) narrated that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The best of dowries is that which is most affordable.” It was narrated by Abu Dawud (2117) with the wording: “The best of marriages is that which is most affordable.” This was classed as authentic by Al-Albani.\xa0\nIt says in ‘Awn Al-Ma`bud:\xa0“I.e. the easiest for the man by making the dowry and so on easy. Al-`Allamah Ash-Shaykh Al-`Azizi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: i.e., the lowest dowry or the easiest in accepting the proposal.”\xa0\nAhmad (23957) and Ibn Majah (4095) narrated from `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “One of the signs of a woman being blessed is that the process of proposing to her is made easy and the dowry is made affordable and she bears children easily.” (Classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih Al-Jami`, 2235)\xa0\nAt-Tirmidhi (1114) narrated that `Umar ibn Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Do not go to extremes with regard to women's dowries. If that were something honourable in this world or a sign of piety before Allah, then the Prophet of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would have been the most entitled to it, but I never heard that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) offered as a dowry for any of his wives or accepted as a dowry for any of his daughters anything more than twelve Uqiyah. (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Tirmidhi)\xa0\nAn Uqiyah is 40 Dirhams; the weight of a Dirham in grams is 2.975 g [of silver].\xa0\nAnnouncing the marriage\xa0\nAt-Tirmidhi (1089) narrated from `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that she said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Announce this marriage .” (Classed as sound by Al-Albani in Al-Irwa’, 7/50)\xa0\nAn-Nasa’i (3369) narrated that Muhammad ibn Hatib (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “What separates permissible from prohibited is\xa0 [beating] the Daff and singing at the wedding.” (Classed as sound by Al-Albani)\xa0\nBeating the daff at weddings is limited to women only\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Fath: “In the strong Hadiths, there is permission for that for women; it is not appropriate for men, because of the general prohibition on men resembling women.”\xa0\nThe wedding feast (Walimah)\xa0\nThis is a confirmed Sunnah at weddings and it is part of announcing the marriage and of expressing joy and happiness on this occasion.\xa0\nIt was narrated from Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to `Abd Ar-Rahman ibn `Awf (may Allah be pleased with him) when he got married: “Give a feast even if it is with just one sheep.” (Al-Bukhari and Muslim)\xa0\nSome of the scholars said that this is obligatory, because of the reports narrated by Ahmad (22526) from Ibn Buraydah from his father, who said: When `Ali proposed to Fatimah (may Allah be pleased with them both), the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There has to be a feast for the wedding.” Al-Albani said in Adab Al-Zafaf (72): “There is nothing wrong with its Isnad [chain of narration], as Ibn Hajar said in Al-Fath.”\xa0\nIt is obligatory to attend the feast if invited . It was narrated from `Abdullah ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If one of you is invited to the feast, let him go to it.” (Al-Bukhari and Muslim)\xa0\nIbn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy upon him) said:\xa0\n“The scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) say that it is obligatory to respond to the first invitation, i.e., if one is mentioned by name and invited as an individual, whether the host invites him himself or through a deputy or by means of a card sent to him, on condition that there be no evils involved in the wedding feast. If there is any evil involved, then it depends: if when attending he is able to prevent the evil, then he must attend; if he is not able to do that, then it is not permissible for him to attend.” (Liqa’ Al-Bab Al-Maftuh, 13/133)\xa0\nIt is permissible to offer a wedding feast without meat. Al-Bukhari (4213) narrated that Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) halted between Khaybar and Madinah for three days, during which he married Safiyyah (may Allah be pleased with her). I invited the Muslims to his wedding feast, in which there was no bread and no meat; there was nothing except what the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) commanded Bilal (may Allah be pleased with him) to spread out of leather mats, on which dates, ghee and dried yoghurt were placed.\xa0\nHow to congratulate someone on marriage\nIt is recommended to congratulate the husband as the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) congratulated people. It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that when a man got married he would congratulate him and pray for him, saying: “May Allah bless you and bring blessings upon you and bring you together in goodness.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud (2130) and classed as authentic by Al-Albani)\xa0\nWhat to do on wedding night\nIt is recommended for the husband to do several things when he enters upon his wife, including the following:\xa0\n\nBeing kind and gentle to his wife when consummating the marriage with her\n\nIt was narrated by Ahmad (26925) that Asma’ bint `Umays (may Allah be pleased with her) said: I was the one who took care of `Aishah and prepared her for her marriage to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and I had some women with me. She said: By Allah, we did not find any food with him except a vessel of milk. He drank from it then he passed it to `Aishah, but the young girl felt too shy. We said: Do not turn away the hand of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him); take it from him. She took it shyly and drank from it, then he said: Pass it to your friends. We said: We do not feel like drinking it. He (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: Do not combine hunger with lies. (Classed as sound by Al-Albani in Adab Al-Zafaf, 19)\xa0\n\nPutting his hand on his wife's head and praying for her\n\nBecause of the reports narrated by Abu Dawud (2160) from `Amr ibn Shu`ayb, from his father, from his grandfather, from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) who said: “ When one of you marries a woman, let him take hold of her forelock and say: O Allah, I ask You for the goodness within her and the goodness that You have made her inclined towards, and I take refuge with You from the evil within her and the evil that You have made her inclined towards.” (Classed as sound by Al-Albani)\xa0\n\nSome of the Salaf regarded it as recommended for them to pray two Rak`ahs together :\n\nIbn Abu Shaybah (17156) narrated that Shaqiq said: A man came to `Abdullah ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) and said: ‘I have married a young virgin girl, but I am afraid that she may hate me.’ `Abdullah said: ‘Love comes from Allah and hatred comes from satan, who wants to make you hate what Allah has made permissible. When she comes to you, tell her to pray two Rak`ahs behind you.’” (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Adab Al-Zafaf, 24)\xa0\n\nHe should say before he has intercourse with his wife: Bismillahi Allahumma jannibna Ash-Shaytan wa jannib Ash-Shaytan ma razaqtana (In the name of Allah, O Allah, protect us from satan and protect whatever You give to us from satan)’ because of the report narrated by Al-Bukhari (3271) from Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When one of you wants to approach (have intercourse with) his wife, if he says: ‘Bismillahi Allahumma jannibna Ash-Shaytan wa jannib Ash-Shaytan ma razaqtana (In the name of Allah, O Allah, protect us from satan and protect whatever You give to us from satan )’ – then if they are given a child, satan will not harm it.”\xa0\nWe affirm the importance of kind treatment of the wife and fearing Allah with regard to her, and that she should fear Allah with regard to him (the husband).\xa0\n\nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“and live with them honourably. If you dislike them, it may be that you dislike a thing and Allah brings through it a great deal of good.” [An-Nisa’ 4:19]\xa0\nAlso, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If a woman offers her five daily prayers, fasts her month (Ramadan), guards her chastity and obeys her husband, it will be said to her: Enter Paradise from whichever of the Gates of Paradise you wish.” (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Takhrij Al-Mishkat, 3254)\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/129635/prophet-muhammads-guidance-on-marriage
