316796,"I found out that I should have offered a sacrifice when I did Hajj. I did Hajj tamattu‘ [‘umrah followed by Hajj, exiting ihram in between] for two years, but I did not offer a sacrifice and I did not fast for ten days, because I was unaware of the ruling, and that was not deliberate. What must I do now?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt is obligatory for the one who is doing tamattu‘ to offer a sacrifice, subject to two conditions:\n\nThat he is not one of those who live in the area of al-Masjid al-Haram, namely the residents of the Haram zone.\nThat he can afford the price of the sacrificial animal, meaning that he has wealth that is surplus to his expenses and basic needs, and those of his family, with which to buy the sacrificial animal.\n\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{then whoever performs ‘umrah [during the Hajj months] followed by Hajj [offers] what can be obtained with ease of sacrificial animals. And whoever cannot find [or afford such an animal] - then a fast of three days during Hajj and of seven when you have returned [home]. Those are ten complete [days]. This is for those whose family is not in the area of al-Masjid al-Haram}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:196].\nSee also the answer to question no. 112003 .\nSecondly:\nIf it is confirmed that offering the sacrifice was obligatory for you, it is not waived because of being unaware of the ruling or forgetting. Therefore you must seek Allah’s forgiveness for your shortcoming, and you must slaughter two sacrificial animals in Makkah and distribute the meat to the poor of the Haram, or appoint someone to do that on your behalf.\nShaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\nSomeone intended to do Hajj qiran [‘umrah followed by Hajj without exiting ihram in between] but he did not offer a sacrifice, because he was unaware of the ruling. After a long time, he realised that he should have offered a sacrifice. What must he do?\nHe said: He must offer the sacrifice as soon as he realises, to be slaughtered in Makkah or Mina. There is nothing wrong with him and his family and friends eating from it. End quote from Majmu‘ Fatawa ash-Shaykh Ibn Baz (18/25).\nShaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\nI did tamattu‘ [‘umrah followed by Hajj, exiting ihram in between], but I did not offer a sacrifice and I did not fast. What is the ruling?\nHe replied: Now you have to repent to Allah.\nIf you could afford a sacrificial animal in the year in which you did Hajj, then you must offer the sacrifice today, but it must be done in Makkah.\nIf you could not afford a sacrificial animal in the year in which you did Hajj, then you must fast ten days, so now fast ten days, even in your own city.""(Majmu‘ Fatawa ash-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin\xa022/213).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/316796/i-did-hajj-tamattu-for-two-years-but-did-not-offer-a-sacrifice-and-did-not-fast-ten-days-because-i-was-unaware-of-the-ruling-and-that-was-not-deliberate-what-must-i-do-now
342926,"I did Hajj with my family a few years ago, and on the third of the days of at-tashriq [i.e., 13th Dhul-Hijjah], we set out after ‘Asr to stone the jamarat. The route was crowded, and before stoning the jamarat or whilst stoning them – I don’t remember exactly – we heard the adhan for Maghrib. I believe that we finished stoning the jamarat whilst the adhan was still ongoing, but I am not sure. My father was behind us, and it seems that he stoned the jamarat after Maghrib. What should we do?","['Praise be to Allah.When does the time for stoning the jamarat end on the third of the days of at-tashriq?\nThe time for stoning the jamarat on the third of the days of at-tashriq ends at sunset, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And remember Allah during [specific] numbered days. Then whoever hastens [his departure] in two days - there is no sin upon him; and whoever delays [until the third] - there is no sin upon him - for him who fears Allah . And fear Allah and know that unto Him you will be gathered}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:203].\nSo whoever stones the jamarat after sunset, his stoning does not count. The basic principle is that the mu’adhdhin does not give the call to prayer except when the sun has set. Based on that, whatever stoning occurs after the adhan is not valid.\nRuling on one who omits to stone the jamarat\nIf someone omits to stone all of the jamarat, or he omits stoning them on one day, or he omits stoning one jamrah, then he must offer a compensatory sacrifice, which is a sheep, to be slaughtered and the meat given to the poor of Makkah and the Haram.\nIt says in Kashshaf al-Qina‘ (2/510):\nIf he delays stoning the jamarat altogether until after the days of at-tashriq, or he delays stoning Jamrat al-‘Aqabah until after the days of at-tashriq, or he omits to spend the night in Mina for one night or more of the nights of the days of at-tashriq, then he must offer a compensatory sacrifice, because Ibn ‘Abbas said: Whoever omits or forgets a ritual, he must slaughter an animal [as a compensatory sacrifice].\nFrom this it is known that if he omitted to spend part of a night in Mina, nothing is required of him. What appears to be the case is that that applies even if he spent most of the night somewhere other than Mina.\nHe should not do it – i.e., stoning the jamarat – after the days of at-tashriq have ended, which also applies to staying overnight in Mina during those nights. If he omitted to do it, he should not do it now, because the time for it has gone, but he must offer the fidyah that is required for that.\nIf he omits one pebble, the penalty is the same as that for shaving one hair, and if he omits two pebbles, the penalty is that of shaving two hairs. For more than that, he must offer a compensatory sacrifice, as mentioned above with regard to shaving the head [before exiting ihram]. End quote.\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Omitting stoning the jamarat altogether only requires one fidyah. So if he omitted stoning altogether, or he omitted part of it, if he omitted stoning one of the three jamarat, or he omitted stoning on one complete day, he only has to offer one fidyah, which will cover all of it.\nBut the scholars stated that if what is omitted is one or two pebbles for the last jamrah, then it may be overlooked, according to many scholars, but if he omitted three pebbles, it cannot be overlooked; rather he must complete it. If the time for it has ended, then he must offer a compensatory sacrifice.\nWhatever the case, the jamarat overlap, meaning that if he omits all of them, or he omits stoning on one of the days of at-tashriq other than the third day – meaning that he did not stone the jamarat on the eleventh day or the twelfth day, or he omitted one jamrah, meaning seven pebbles, or he omitted four pebbles, or five pebbles, or three pebbles – then he must offer a compensatory sacrifice. End quote from Fatawa Nur ‘ala ad-Darb.\nBased on that, if the adhan was given for Maghrib before you stoned the middle jamrah or the largest one, then you must offer a compensatory sacrifice. The same is also required of your father. So you can delegate someone to slaughter two sheep on your behalf in Makkah, and distribute the meat among the poor of Makkah.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/342926/ruling-on-one-who-stoned-the-jamarat-during-the-adhan-of-maghrib-or-after-that-on-the-thirteenth-of-dhul-hijjah
