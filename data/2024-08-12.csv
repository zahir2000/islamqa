505030,"I want to ask about the situation of a worker (the cashier who works in a shop). Prices of goods are written on a price list for customers. For example, the price for a carton of milk is written as 7.68 dirhams, but when the customer goes to the cashier to pay, he registers it as 8 dirhams, because he has been instructed by the management of the shop that anything above 0.60 is to be counted as one dirham. … Everyone knows this rule, because the company has many branches… What I want to say is that many people who are good at maths, meaning that they are not illiterate, know that 0.97 or 0.87 or 0.60 will be rounded up to one dirham, and that 0.50 or less will be rounded up to half a  dirham. We may add that it is not possible to give that fraction back to the purchaser in change, because it is not available at all, meaning that it is not  possible to give him one dirham and 0.44 of a dirham.… Finally I would like to ask you: is it permissible to work as a cashier, based on the details given above?","['Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible for the store to take any of the customer’s money except with his knowledge and consent, even if it is a small amount, such as the change asked about here.\nIf the price of the item is 9.90 dirhams, it is not permissible to count it as ten except with the consent of the customer, because Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {O you who have believed, do not consume one another\'s wealth unjustly\xa0but only [in lawful] business by mutual consent} [an-Nisa’ 4:29].\nAnd the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “It is not permissible to take a person’s wealth except with his willing consent.” Narrated by Ahmad (20172); classed as authentic by al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami‘ (7662).\nAnd he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Your blood, your wealth and your honour are sacred to you, as sacred as this day of yours, in this month of yours, in this land of yours. Let those who are present convey it to those who are absent.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (67) and Muslim (16779).\nAnd he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The whole of a Muslim is sacred to another Muslim, his blood, his wealth and his honour.” Narrated by Muslim (2564).\nThese texts indicate that the wealth of a Muslim is sacred, and it makes no difference whether his wealth is great or small.\nMuslim (137) narrated from Abu Umamah that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever swears an oath in order to unlawfully take the property of another Muslim, Allah will decree Hell for him and forbid Paradise to him.” A man said: Even if it is something small, O Messenger of Allah? He said: “Even if it is a twig from an arak tree.”\nIbn Hazm (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is not permissible to take anyone’s wealth unless it is based on a religious text or certain scholarly consensus. It is not permissible for anyone to stipulate a financial penalty that was not stipulated in the Qur’an or by the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Anyone who does that is transgressing the limits set by Allah, is regarding haram wealth as lawful and is prescribing something for which Allah, may He be exalted, has not given permission.""(Al-Muhalla\xa0 6/186).\nIf the customer is owed change, but the shop does not have that precise amount, he may be given some candy or the like instead, or the shop may offer to give it on his behalf in charity, and a box should be made available for that.\nConclusion:\nIt is obligatory to inform the customer of the amount of change that is due to him. If the customer agrees [to round it up], there is nothing wrong with that, otherwise it is haram to take it.\nIf the cashier is able to take this obligatory action, it is permissible for him to work in that job, otherwise it is prohibited, because of what his work involves of participating in consuming people’s wealth unlawfully.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/505030/what-is-the-ruling-on-stores-rounding-up-pennies-and-taking-them-without-the-customers-knowledge
227312,Is it permissible to say “good luck” or “bad luck”?,"['Praise be to Allah.Is saying good luck prohibited?\n\xa0“Luck” (Hadh) means a share of goodness (or good fortune). Al-Azhari (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAl-Layth said: “Luck” means a share of blessings or goodness. (Tahdhib Al-Lughah, 3/273)\nIbn Faris (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Luck” means a share of good fortune… One who has a share of provision may be described as lucky.” (Majmal Al-Lughah, p. 215)\nThis is the basic meaning: luck refers to a share of good fortune. The word may also be used to refer to fortune in general, whether it is good or bad. This is how it is used by most people.\nAl-Fayruzabadi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Luck” refers to one’s share or fortune; or it may be used specifically to refer to one’s share of good fortune.” (Al-Qamus Al-Muhit, p. 695)\nAl-Munawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Luck” is one’s decreed share.” (At-Tawqif, p. 142)\nBased on that, when people say “good luck” and the like, as a kind of supplication for the person to whom it is said, and wishing him well, there is nothing wrong with that, as is obvious; in fact it is praiseworthy because it is a kind of supplication for good and wishing the Muslims well.\nBut one should not wish or pray for bad luck for a Muslim, because this involves transgression and enmity towards one’s brother in faith.\nMuslim narrated (2735) from Abu Hurayrah, from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that he said: “A person will still be answered so long as his supplication does not involve sin or severing ties of kinship, and so long as he does not become impatient.” It was said: O Messenger of Allah, what does being impatient mean? He said: “Saying, I offered supplication, and I offered supplication, and I did not receive any response, then he becomes frustrated and stops offering supplication.”\nAl-Bukhari (13) and Muslim (45) narrated from Anas ibn Malik that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “No one of you truly believes until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself.”\nCan you say `good luck’ by way of telling something that happened?\nIf the one who says “good luck” is saying it by way of telling something that happened, so if something good happens to him he says that it was good luck, and if something bad happens to him, he says that it was bad luck, in this case too there does not seem to be anything wrong with it, in sha Allah.\nIn the case of something good happening, then the matter is clear, and it comes under the heading of speaking of the blessings of Allah and thanking Him for what He decreed for him.\xa0\nIn the case of something bad happening, then what appears to be the case is that there is also nothing wrong with it, if he is telling of something that actually happened as it appears to be, to the best of the person’s knowledge. It is well-known that things may happen to a person in his life that upset him, and this is bad luck, according to what people customarily think and say; in fact it is something that is also said in the shar`i texts. Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Say (O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)): I possess no power of benefit or hurt to myself except as Allah wills. If I had the knowledge of the Ghayb (unseen), I should have secured for myself an abundance of wealth, and no evil should have touched me”\xa0[Al-A`raf 7:188]\n“Is not He (better than your gods) Who responds to the distressed one, when he calls Him, and Who removes the evil, and makes you inheritors of the earth, generations after generations. Is there any Ilah (god) with Allah? Little is that you remember!”\xa0[An-Naml 27:62].\nThis is also what is meant by Hasanah (good, good fortune) and Sayyi’ah (evil, bad fortune), which is referred to in verses such as the following (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And if some good reaches them, they say, `This is from Allah,’ but if some evil befalls them, they say, `This is from you (O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)).’ Say: `All things are from Allah,’ so what is wrong with these people that they fail to understand any word?”\xa0[An-Nisa’ 4:78]\n“And We tried them with good (blessings) and evil (calamities) in order that they might turn (to Allah’s Obedience).”\xa0[Al-A`raf 7:168]\nAnd there are many similar, well known verses.\nBut in that case it is stipulated that there should be nothing in his words that reflects discontent with what Allah has willed and decreed for him, or thinking negatively of Allah, or attributing the evil or bad fortune to Him, may He be glorified. Bad things, evil and harm are a reality in Allah’s creation and are something that He has decreed will reach His slave according to what is decreed for that person. As for Allah’s will and decree concerning His slaves, it is all good and nothing evil or bad can be attributed to Him, for Allah is exalted and far above all faults and shortcomings.\nCan you say ‘good luck’ or ‘bad luck’ thinking that some such thing has happened outside the decree of Allah?\nSome people may say “good luck” or “bad luck”, thinking that some such thing has happened outside of the decree of Allah, may He be exalted, or because he thinks that it is connected to some things that have nothing to do with events that happen, such as attributing that to the stars, or some numbers, or some days of the week, and the like.\nSo if someone says that some person’s good luck or bad luck is due to such a reason, then what he says is wrong and is prohibited, because coincidence with such things, or otherwise, is not something that Allah has made to be the cause of good or evil.\nSomething similar was indicated in a Fatwa of the Standing Committee, when they were asked:\nWe often hear that a person has good luck or bad luck (or he is lucky or unlucky). To what extent is it permissible – or not – to believe in luck?\nThey replied:\n“We are required to believe in the will and decree of Allah, so we should be patient in bearing misfortune and we should give thanks to Allah and praise Him for good fortune. We should believe that Allah has divided provision among His slaves, and has decreed that their life spans and deeds should vary, when they were still foetuses in their mothers’ wombs. Allah is most wise in all that He wills and decrees, and every Muslim must attribute what befalls people of blessings and abundant provision to Allah, may He be glorified, Who bestows that and enables people to attain it; and he should attribute anything else that befalls him to the will and decree of Allah. This comes under the heading of attaining sound belief in Tawhid Ar-Rububiyyah (Oneness of divine Lordship). The Muslim must keep away from anything that may undermine his belief and Tawhid, so he should not attribute good and blessings, or calamities and disasters, to luck or stars, for that is not permissible. And Allah is the source of strength. May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.” (Standing Committee for Academic Research and Issuing Fatwas, Shaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn `Abdullah Al Ash-Shaykh, Shaykh `Abdullah ibn Ghadyan, Shaykh Salih Al-Fawzan, Shaykh Bakr Abu Zayd- Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 26/328)\nThinking positively of Allah\xa0\nThe Muslim should always think positively of Allah, may He be Exalted, concerning whatever befalls him in all his affairs. He may think that he has bad luck in something that may be entirely good for him. So it is better to avoid the phrase “bad luck” in all circumstances. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“and it may be that you dislike a thing which is good for you and that you like a thing which is bad for you. Allah knows but you do not know.”\xa0[Al-Baqarah 2:216]\nMuslim narrated (2999) that Suhayb (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “How wonderful is the situation of the believer, for all his affairs are good. If something good happens to him, he gives thanks for it and that is good for him; if something bad happens to him, he bears it with patience, and that is good for him.”\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 27192 , 33844 , 46985 , 33842 , 97221 , 2039 , and 158980 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/227312/is-saying-good-luck-prohibited
488953,What are the reasons why the hadiths were written down?,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe writing down of the hadiths refers, in general terms, to the narrator writing down his reports on paper. This was known from the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nThe main reason for that was to document and protect the reports from being lost or forgotten.\nThis reason is so clear that there is no need for further discussion of proof.\nOne example of that is what was narrated by al-Bukhari (113) from Abu Hurayrah, who said: There is no one among the companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) who narrated more from him than me, except ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr, who wrote down his hadiths and I did not.\nAt the time of the Sahabah and senior Tabi‘in, there were a number of people who wrote down some of their reports, but they did not pay attention to documenting the hadiths in a specific manner, compiling them in books as the Quran was compiled in one mushaf. There are a number of reports which indicate that they were not in favour of compiling the hadiths in a book.\nThere were two reasons for that:\n-1-\nThey wanted to protect the Quran from being abandoned, or to avoid anything being written down at the time when the Sahabah were collecting the Quran in writing, lest the two things become mixed and confused.\n-2-\nAt that time, the hadiths contained only the words and actions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) which explained the verses of the Quran. The isnads (chains of narration) were also brief and were hardly mentioned; they were not so lengthy that the Arabs would not be able to memorize them, for they were people who had excellent memories and were keen to maintain that skill by memorizing things. Moreover, the hadiths are not like the Quran, recitation of which is an act of worship; the hadiths are to be acted upon. As that is the case, there was no need for each of the Sahabah to know all the hadiths with their exact wording; rather it was sufficient for each of them to know some of the hadiths, then ask one another [about other hadiths] when necessary.\nShaykh ‘Abd ar-Rahman al-Mu‘allimi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIn Islamic terms, what matters with regard to the hadiths is their meanings. They are not like the Quran, in which what matters is both the exact wording and the meaning, because it is the word of Allah in both wording and meaning, and is miraculous in both wording and meaning, and it is recited as an act of worship with its wording exactly as it was revealed. So it is no wonder that Allah reduced their burden and made it sufficient, in most cases, for some of the Sahabah to be aware of the hadiths and convey them.""(Al-Anwar al-Kashifah, in Athar al-Mu‘allimi\xa012/43).\nSome of them at that time would narrate hadiths and would seek out hadiths when necessary for practical reasons, so that they could act upon them, without going beyond that.\nShaykh ‘Abd ar-Rahman al-Mu‘allimi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n… It was narrated from ‘Umar that he forbade narrating a lot of hadiths, and he did that for two reasons:\n-1-\n‘Umar’s preference was that narrating hadiths should only be done when needed.\n-2-\nWhat he stated clearly, which was that he preferred people not to be distracted from the Quran by listening to hadiths when there was no need to do so.\nIt was narrated from him that he said: “Narrate few hadiths from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and only narrate that which is needed to be acted upon.”\nThe reference to acting in this quotation is general in meaning, and includes acts of worship, interactions with others and etiquette.""(Al-Anwar al-Kashifah, in Athar al-Mu‘allimi\xa0 12/61).\nDealing with the situation in that manner made it easy for them to memorize what they needed, therefore there was no urgent need to write the hadiths in a book. This is similar to the case of the Quran, which was revealed little by little, which made it easy for them to memorize it without needing to have the entire Quran in one book.\nAl-Khatib al-Baghdadi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIt has been proven that those who did not like to write down hadiths during the early period of Islam only disliked that so that no other book would be given the same importance as the Book of Allah, and the people would not be distracted from the Quran by anything else. Thus the Muslims were forbidden to acquire and read the previous Scriptures, because it is not possible to know what of their contents is true and what is false. Moreover, the Quran is sufficient and there is no need for the earlier Scriptures, because it supersedes them. And books of knowledge were prohibited during the earliest period, when Islam was very new, because there were so few people with proper knowledge at that time who could distinguish between revelation and other things. Most of the Bedouin had no understanding of religion and did not spend time with the scholars and knowledgeable people, so there was the possibility that they might confuse the books of hadith with the words of Allah in the Quran, and might believe that what was contained in the books of hadith was the words of Allah.\nThe people were instructed to memorize hadiths, because the isnads were short, as it was not long after the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). They were forbidden to rely on books, because that would lead to a decline in memorization to the point that it would be almost non-existent, but if there was no writing down of hadiths, then people’s memories would become strong, for a person’s memory is with him wherever he goes.""(Taqyid al-‘Ilm\xa0 p. 57).\nIbn ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThose scholars who disapproved of the writing down of hadiths disapproved for two reasons:\nThe first reason was so that there would be no book that was given the same importance as the Quran.\nThe second reason was so that the one who wrote down hadiths would not rely on what he had written and forego memorizing, in which case there would be fewer people who memorized hadiths.""(Jami‘ Bayan al-‘Ilm wa Fadlihi\xa0 1/292).\nSecondly:\nLater on, especially in the second century AH, there emerged an urgent need to write down the hadiths in books, because the situation had changed. The hadiths had become widely circulated among people, because when the Tabi‘in realized that the number of Sahabah and senior Tabi‘in was declining due to their dying, they strove to seek out the hadiths that they had narrated, which they collected and kept in written form.\nAl-Bukhari (99) narrated from ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Aziz that he wrote to Abu Bakr ibn Hazm, saying: Seek out whatever hadiths of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) are extant and write them down, for I am afraid that with the death of the scholars, knowledge will disappear.\nShaykh ‘Abd ar-Rahman al-Mu‘allimi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAs a matter-of-fact, some of the senior Sahabah thought that conveying of hadiths was only to be done at a time of need, and they thought that if they conveyed hadiths to others when there was no need for that, there was the possibility of error for which they could be called to account, unlike when there was a need, in which case conveying what they knew of hadith was a must, and either Allah would protect them from error or a He would not bring them to account for it. Hence hadiths were narrated from all of them, and it was never narrated from any of them that he knew a hadith, but when there was a need to act according to its guidelines he refused to narrate it.\nSome other Sahabah narrated hadiths even when there was no need for that, because they thought that conveying them before the need arose was something good, as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Narrate from me, and there is nothing wrong with it.” And there is other evidence which speaks of conveying knowledge and conveying hadiths.\nEach of the two views has a point, and the scholars were all aiming to do good.\nBut when the number of Sahabah became few, the view of the second group carried more weight.""(Al-Anwar al-Kashifah, in Athar al-Mu‘allimi\xa012/61).\nThis is like the case of the Quran at the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): there was no urgent need to put it all together in a written book, but as the reciters among the Sahabah who had memorized it began to die one after another, there emerged the need to compile it all in one master copy.\nIt was narrated from ‘Ubayd ibn as-Sabbaq that Zayd ibn Thabit (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Abu Bakr sent for me when the people of Yamamah had been killed (i.e., a number of the Prophet\'s Companions who fought against Musaylimah). (I went to him) and found \'Umar bin al-Khattab sitting with him. Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) said (to me):‘ ‘Umar has come to me and said: Casualties were heavy among the reciters of the Quran (i.e. those who knew the Quran by heart) at the Battle of Yamamah, and I am afraid that more heavy casualties may take place among the reciters on other battlefields, whereby a large part of the Quran may be lost. Therefore I suggest that you [Abu Bakr] should issue orders that the Quran be collected.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (4986).\nAnd there are many similar reports, because the hadiths had begun to include the fatwas and verdicts of the Sahabah, then the views and fatwas of the Tabi‘in.\n‘Abd ar-Razzaq narrated in al-Musannaf (11/258) from Ma‘mar that Salih ibn Kaysan said: I met Ibn Shihab when we were both seeking knowledge, and we agreed to write down some hadiths and other reports. So we wrote down everything that was narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), then we wrote down what was narrated from his companions. I said: No, it is not part of the Sunnah. But he said: Yes, it is part of the Sunnah. So he wrote it down and I did not; he did well and I missed out.\nThen the isnads (chains of narration) became lengthy and numerous, because the number of narrators increased.\nIn addition to that, many views of innovators began to spread among the people, and views based on personal opinion and fabrications of hadiths and reports also became widespread.\nAll of this prompted the leading scholars of hadith and Sunnah to compile what they had collected of hadiths in specialized books, so as to preserve the Sunnah and spread it among people.\nAl-Khatib al-Baghdadi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nScholars only began to write down knowledge and rely on writing down hadiths in books, after having been reluctant to do that, because hadiths and reports had become widespread; isnads had become longer; the names, kunyahs and lineages of narrators had become numerous; and technical terms varied, and people were unable to memorize all of that…""(Taqyid al-‘Ilm\xa0 p. 64).\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nYou should understand, may Allah increase me and you in knowledge, that the reports of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) were not written down in books at the time of his Companions and the senior Tabi‘in, and they were not sorted into categories, for two reasons:\nThe first reason was because, in the beginning, they were forbidden to do that, as is proven in Sahih Muslim, because of the fear that some of that might become mixed with the Quran.\nThe second reason was because they had the ability to memorise things and their minds were clear, and because most of them did not know how to read and write.\nThen towards the end of the time of the Tabi‘in, the writing down of hadiths and reports began, and similar hadiths and reports were grouped together in different categories, when the scholars scattered throughout different regions, and a lot of innovations appeared on the part of the Kharijis, Rafidis and those who denied the divine decree (Qadaris).\nThe first ones to compile the reports in books were ar-Rabi‘ ibn Subayh and Sa‘id ibn Abi ‘Urubah…""(Hadi as-Sari\xa0p. 6).\nThis has to do with general reasons, but there may have been specific reasons too. The author of each book may have had a specific motive, on the basis of which he chose to put hadiths in certain categories. For example, it is well known that al-Bukhari divided his book al-Jami‘ as-Sahih [Sahih al-Bukhari] into various categories for certain reasons.\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAbu ‘Abdillah Muhammad ibn Isma‘il al-Bukhari said: We were with Ishaq ibn Rahawayh and he said: Why do you not write a brief book in which you record the sound hadiths of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)?\nHe said: I liked that idea, so I began to compile the book of al-Jami‘ as-Sahih [Sahih al-Bukhari] …""(Hadi as-Sari\xa0 7).\nAbu Musa al-Madini narrated in Khasa’is Musnad al-Imam Ahmad (p. 14):\nIt was narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn Ahmad ibn Hanbal said: I said to my father (may Allah have mercy on him): Why did you not like people to write books, then you did al-Musnad?\nHe said: I wrote this book to be a reference book, so that if people differed concerning the hadiths of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), they can refer to it.

Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And I (Allah) created not the jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me (Alone).” [Adh-Dhariyat 51:56]\nAllah sent the Messengers to call their people to worship Allah alone (Tawhid ) and to forbid them to associate anything with Him (polytheism). Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And We did not send any Messenger before you (O Muhammad) but We revealed to him (saying): La ilaha illa Ana [none has the right to be worshipped but I (Allah)], so worship Me (Alone and none else).” [Al-Anbiya’ 21:25]\nWhat is Shirk?\nPolytheism means directing worship to other than Allah, and Du`a comes under the heading of worship which must be devoted to Allah alone and not directed to anyone else. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Du`a is worship .” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 2969; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Tirmidhi)\xa0\nCan we seek help from other than Allah?\nAsking for Madad (help or support) from anyone other than Allah, as mentioned in the question, is a kind of calling upon (or making Du`a to) someone other than Allah, hence it is a kind of polytheism.\xa0\nIt says in Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah (2/193):\xa0\n“The words of some of those who sing Nashid, “Madad ya sayyidina Al-Husayn (Help O our master Al-Husayn), Madad ya Sayyidah Zaynab, madad ya Badawi ya Shaykh Al-`Arab, madad ya Rasul Allah (O Messenger of Allah), Madad ya awliya’ Allah (O close friends – or ‘saints’ – of Allah),” etc, is major polytheism which puts the one who says it beyond the pale of Islam (Allah forbid), because it is calling upon the dead to give them good things, to help them, to ward off danger or relieve them of harm. That is because what is meant by madad is giving, help and support. So it is as if the person who says, “Madad ya Sayyid ya Badawi, madad ya Sayyidah Zaynab” etc is saying: Help us and give us of your bounty, and relieve us of hardship and ward off calamity from us. This is major polytheism. Allah says, after explaining to His slaves that He is in control of the universe and that it is subjugated to Him:\n“Such is Allah, your Lord; His is the kingdom. And those, whom you invoke or call upon instead of Him, own not even a Qitmir (the thin membrane over the date stone).\nIf you invoke (or call upon) them, they hear not your call; and if (in case) they were to hear, they could not grant it (your request) to you. And on the Day of Resurrection, they will disown your worshipping them. And none can inform you (O Muhammad) like Him Who is the All-Knower (of everything).” [Fatir 35:13-14 – interpretation of the meaning]\xa0\nSo He calls their prayers to others Polytheism.\xa0\nAnd Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And who is more astray than one who calls on (invokes) besides Allah, such as will not answer him till the Day of Resurrection, and who are (even) unaware of their calls (invocations) to them?\nAnd when mankind are gathered (on the Day of Resurrection), they (false deities) will become their enemies and will deny their worshipping.” [Al-Ahqaf 46:6]\xa0\nSo Allah tells us that those who are called upon other than Him, the Prophets and the righteous, are unaware of the call of those who call upon them and will never respond to their calls, and they will be their enemies and will deny their worship of them. \xa0\nAnd Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Do they attribute as partners to Allah those who created nothing but they themselves are created? No help can they give them, nor can they help themselves. And if you call them to guidance, they follow you not. It is the same for you whether you call them or you keep silent. Verily, those whom you call upon besides Allah are slaves like you. So call upon them and let them answer you if you are truthful.” [Al-A`raf 7:191-194]\xa0\n“And whoever invokes (or worships), besides Allah, any other Ilah (god), of whom he has no proof; then his reckoning is only with his Lord.
