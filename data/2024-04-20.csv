241534,"What is the scholars’ view of putting certain things on top of religious books, whether they are books having to do with jurisprudence, creed or Qur’anic exegesis, or putting religious books on top of one another?","['Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with putting religious books on top of one another, but they should not be placed on top of the Mushaf.\nAl-Hakim at-Tirmidhi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nBecause of the sanctity of the Mushaf, if it is placed on a shelf it should not be left open, and no other books should be put on top of it, so that it will always be above other books.""(Nawadir al-Usul\xa03/254).\nOther books should not be placed on top of religious books, such as educational books or others. Also, other things – such as vessels, clothes, food and so on –should not be placed on top of them, out of respect for what they contain of mention of Allah and Islamic sciences.\nAl-Haytami (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAl-Bayhaqi – like al- Halimi – said: The best is not to put anything on top of the Mushaf except another Mushaf, such as a book or garment. Al-Halimi added to that: books of hadith from the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).""(Al-Fatawa al-Hadithiyyah\xa0 p. 164).\nThe ruling could become a prohibition if that is indicative of disrespect or mistreatment of religious books.\nIbn Muflih (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIbn ‘Abd al-Qawiy said in his book Majma‘ al-Bahrayn: It is haram to lean on the Mushaf and on books of hadith and anything that contains some Qur’an, according to scholarly consensus.""(Al-Adab ash-Shar‘iyyah\xa0 2/393).\nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 222344 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/241534/putting-things-on-top-of-religious-books
22292,"Some people regard it as a good or bad omen when they hear a sound in one of their ears, or if their eyelid twitches, and so on. Is there any basis for this?","['Praise be to Allah.There is no basis for regarding ringing in the ears as good or bad omen in Islam. The Muslim has to put his trust in Allah. Regarding things as bad omens is a kind of belief in evil omens, which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) declared to be false and stated that it is a form of polytheism.\xa0\nIf a person notices any such thing (ringing in the ears, etc.), he should ignore it and go ahead with his plans, and not hesitate.\xa0\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Tiyarah (superstition) is that which makes you go ahead or refrain.”\nThe Muslim should also recite the following Du`a: “Allahumma la yu`ti bi’l-hasanat illa anta wa la yadfa` as-sayi’at illa anta, wa la hawla wa la quwwata illa bika (O Allah, none can bring good things except You, and none can ward off evil things except You, and there is no power and no strength except with You).”\nAs for seeing something and interpreting it in an optimistic manner, this is good, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to like optimism. Optimism means thinking well of Allah.\xa0\nFor more details, please refer to the following answers: 46985 , 97221 , 2039 , 33842 , 126359 , 33844 , 362868 , and 8291 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22292/does-the-ringing-of-the-ear-mean-bad-omen-in-islam
129880,"There was a minor issue between me and my wife, and I swore an oath by Allah to my wife that I would not go near her (have intercourse with her) for two months, and if I did that, she would be divorced. What is the ruling on that? If I go near her during the specified period, will she be divorced or do I have to offer expiation for breaking an oath (kaffarat yamin)?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIf a man swears that he will not have intercourse with his wife for a period of less than four months, this is ila’ (an oath of abstinence) according to the most correct scholarly opinion, and it is the view of a number of the Tabi‘in. So if he does not have intercourse with her throughout that period, he does not have to do anything, but if he does have intercourse with her during that period, he must offer expiation for breaking an oath.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: An-Nakha‘i, Qatadah, Hammad, Ibn Abi Layla and Ishaq said: Whoever swears an oath that he will not have intercourse with his wife for a short period of time or a long period of time, and he does not have intercourse with her for four months, then this is ila’ (an oath of abstinence), because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{For those who swear not to have sexual relations with their wives is a waiting time of four months}\xa0[Al-Baqarah 2:226].\nThis is an oath of abstinence.""(Al-Mughni\xa0 7/415).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Regarding the words ‘More than four months’, the apparent meaning of the author’s words indicates that if he swears that he will not have intercourse with her for four months only, that is not ila’ (an oath of abstinence), or if he swears that he will not have intercourse with her for three months, that is not ila’ (an oath of abstinence) either. However, the correct view is that it is ila’ (an oath of abstinence), because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{For those who swear not to have sexual relations with their wives is a waiting time of four months}\xa0[Al-Baqarah 2:226].\nSo Allah confirms that it is ila’ (an oath of abstinence), but He stipulated that the period they must wait for is four months. So if someone says: By Allah, I will not have intercourse with my wife for three months, then this is ila’ (an oath of abstinence), because he has sworn not to have intercourse with her, but we do not say anything to him for now, because once that period (three months) has passed, his oath is no longer binding. For example, a man says to his wife: By Allah, I will not have intercourse with you for a period of three months. In this case, we say: This is ila’ (an oath of abstinence), but we do not impose on him the consequences of that oath; rather we wait until three months have passed, and once that period ends, the ruling on his oath is no longer binding.""(Ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘\xa0 13/218).\nSecondly:\nWith regard to your saying, ‘If I go near her, she will be divorced,’ this is a divorce that is dependent upon a condition being met. The majority of jurists are of the view that divorce takes place when that condition is met, so if you have intercourse with her, it counts as one divorce (talaq).\nSome of the scholars are of the view that reference should be made to the husband’s intention. If he intended that divorce should take place when the condition was met, then it counts as one divorce, but if he did not intend that divorce should take place – rather he wanted to threaten her or prevent himself from doing that – then this is an oath for which he must offer expiation when it is broken. This is the more correct view, and it is the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) and others.\nWhat we think is that you should keep away from your wife until the two months are over, so as to avoid divorce taking place, because the majority of scholars, including the four imams, regard divorce as taking place in a case such as this.\nWhat is strange is that you hastened to swear this oath and issue a conditional divorce even though the problem between you and your wife was minor, as you mentioned. What the husband should do is fear Allah, may He be exalted, and adhere to the limits He has set, and not use divorce as a means to issue threats or vent his anger.\nWe ask Allah to rectify all our affairs.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/129880/he-swore-that-he-would-not-go-near-his-wife-for-two-months-and-if-he-did-so-she-would-be-divorced
