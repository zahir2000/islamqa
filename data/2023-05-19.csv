262300,"How can I wash off impurity (najasah) in a correct manner? I hope you can explain the following scenarios: 1. Cleansing impurity from a smooth, impermeable surface, as opposed to a permeable surface (I have heard that you do not need to use water on a smooth, impermeable surface). Also, how many times does it have to be washed with water? 2. How can we make cushions and pillows, and all thick items, pure? 3. How many times must urine/non-visible impurities be washed from clothing? Also, do we have to wring them out or is it sufficient to wash them under running water, using the same amount of water as we would use to wash them and wring them out? 4. I have heard that we can submerge the clothing in a vessel filled with water that is three times the amount of urine (so let’s say that the urine is 100 ml; we can submerge that part of the garment in 300 ml of water without needing to wring it out). Or if we put the clothes in the bathtub, the impurity will not affect the water. Is that correct? If it is correct, what about non-visible impurity that we cannot see? 5. Are washing machines good to get rid of impurity, if the cycle is not 3 times? The clothes come out with no trace of impurity. 6. The following question is somewhat related: can I use detergents if I do not know whether any ingredients in them of animal origin are haram or not? Will this make all the clothes impure (especially if the detergents use ingredients of animal origin)? Or are all detergents halal because they do not have the physical characteristics of the animal? I’m sorry for asking so many questions, but I have looked everywhere and have not been able to find answers. May Allah reward you with good.","['Praise be to Allah.I.\xa0\nItems that are solid and smooth (impermeable) may be purified by wiping them, according to the correct view, which is the view of Malik and Abu Hanifah, because what matters is removing the impure substance.\nAl-Kasani (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Bada’i‘ as-Sana’i‘ (1/85):\nIf an impure substance (najasah) gets onto something that is solid and smooth (impermeable), such as a sword, mirror and the like, it may be cleansed by scratching, whether it is wet or dry, because none of the impurity will seep through it, and its surface may be cleansed by wiping and scratching. End quote.\nAd-Dasuqi al-Maliki said in al-Hashiyah ‘ala ash-Sharh al-Kabir (1/77): Conclusion: in the case of anything that is solid and smooth (impermeable), when there is the fear that it may be damaged by washing, such as a sword and the like, what got onto it of permissible blood, even if there is a large amount, may be overlooked, for fear of damaging it by washing it. End quote.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Majmu‘ (2/599): If the impure substance (najasah) gets onto something solid, like a sword, knife, mirror and the like, it cannot be cleansed by wiping and can only be cleansed by washing like other things. This was the view of Ahmad and Dawud. Malik and Abu Hanifah said: It may be cleansed by wiping. End quote.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said:\nIn the case of things from which the impure substance may be removed by rubbing – which is items that are smooth, such as mirrors and swords, which do not absorb impurity – the correct view is that they may be purified by rubbing.\nSo if the mirror becomes contaminated with an impure substance, then it is rubbed until it becomes clear, with no impurity on it, then it has been purified.""(Ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘\xa0 1/426).\nII.\nIf the impure substance gets onto cushions and large furnishings such as rugs and the like, then the way to purify them is by pouring water on the impure spot, until the water overwhelms the impure substance that got onto it. Then the water that is contaminated with the impure substance should be dried up with a sponge or some other tool or machine. If the impure substance is removed by that means and no trace of it remains, then this is the desired outcome. If it does not disappear, then it must be washed a second or third time, until you think it most likely that it has been removed. There is no stipulation that the water used should be two or three times the amount of the impure substance, and the like.\nIt is not essential to wring out the impurity or to rub it, so long as the impure substance has disappeared.\nPlease see the answer to question no. 213577 .\nIII.\nThere is no religious text which states the number of times impurity must be washed, except the impurity of a dog only, which must be washed seven times, one of which should be with dust. As for other kinds of impurity, no specific number is specified; rather it must be washed until the impure substance disappears, even if that is achieved by washing it only once.\nSee the answer to question no. 163825 .\nIV.\nWhat matters with regard to water by means of which an impure substance is removed is that it should be a copious amount, so that it will remove the impure substance and leave no trace of its colour or smell, without specifying a particular amount.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Mughni (1/75), regarding purifying impurity other than that of a dog or pig, and whether washing it a specific number of times is required: There are two reports – meaning from Imam Ahmad – regarding that. The first report says that there is a stipulated number of times for that, by analogy with the impurity of a dog… The second report says that there is no stipulated number of times; rather it is sufficient to pour a great deal of water [on the impure substance], without counting a specific number of times, until the impurity is removed. This is the view of ash-Shafa‘i. End quote.\nAfter researching the matter, we have not come across any statement by any scholar to suggest that it is sufficient for the water to be three times the amount of the impure substance. What appears to be the case is that that would not be sufficient, and that this amount of water would be contaminated by the impure substance and would change as a result.\nWhat we found is that some of the scholars stipulated that in order to purify the ground of impurity, the water must be seven times the amount of the impure substance.\nThis view is more likely to be correct than the previous view, yet it is a weak view too, and we do not know of any evidence to indicate that it is sound.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: What is required in order to remove impurity that has seeped into the ground is to pour a large amount of water, so that the impure substance will be absorbed into it.\nAnd there is a view which stipulates that the water that is poured on the ground should be seven times the amount of the urine.\nThis is a weak view; the correct view is the first one.""(Al-Majmu‘\xa0 2/611).\nBased on that, what matters is that the water should be of a large amount, so as to remove the impurity, without specifying a particular amount of water.\nV.\nThe more correct scholarly view is that if impurity falls into water, it does not become impure unless it is changed thereby, such as if its colour or smell is changed.\nThis is the view of the Malikis, and is mentioned in one report from Imam Ahmad. It was regarded as more correct by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah and his student Ibn al-Qayyim. It is also the view favoured by many contemporary scholars, such as Shaykh Ibn Baz, Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin, and the scholars of the Permanent Committee for Ifta’ (may Allah have mercy on them).\nPlease see the answer to question no. 224923 .\nBased on that, if the impure garment is put in the bathtub and does not change the water that is in it, then the water remains pure and does not become impure thereby. But if the colour or smell of the water is changed by the impurity, then it becomes impure.\nBut whatever the case, you should not place the impure garment into a tub of water, if possible; rather you should wash off the impurity first, or pour water over it, so as to ward off any intrusive thoughts and so as to take into consideration the scholarly view which says that the water becomes impure thereby.\nVI.\nIf the impure garment is washed in a washing machine and the trace of impurity is removed from it, then it becomes pure thereby.\nPlease see the answer to question no. 163825 .\nVII.\nWith regard to your question about detergents and what they may contain of ingredients derived from impure animal sources, this is subject to further discussion:\nIf these detergents are obtained from animals which are impure, but after being processed and treated they turn into different substances with characteristics different from those of the impure source from which they were extracted, then there is nothing wrong with using them and cleaning things with them.\nBut if they have not undergone a complete transformation – rather they have retained some of the characteristics of the impure source from which they were obtained – then it is not permissible to use them, because they are part of something impure.\nSo long as we are not certain whether these impurities are present or not, the basic principle regarding these products is that they are pure and halal, and we should not open the door to intrusive thoughts, doubts and hardship.\nIn most cases, that which is derived from animals that were not slaughtered in the prescribed manner and animals that are not permissible to eat will have been transformed from its original state and will have been purified by this transformation. Therefore we may use such things without needing to pay attention to any of that.\nPlease see answer to question no. 97541 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/262300/questions-about-impurity-najasah-and-how-to-cleanse-things-of-it
140804,"Are there conditions stipulated for the prostration of gratitude, such as wearing hijab or doing wudu’?","['Praise be to Allah.We may sum up the discussion on the prostration of gratitude (sujud ash-shukr) in the following points:\n1.\xa0The prostration of gratitude is one of the greatest acts by which a person may express gratitude to his Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, because of what it involves of humbling oneself before Allah by placing the noblest part of the body – which is the face – on the ground, and because of what it involves of thanking Allah in one’s heart, in one’s words and in one’s actions.\n2.\xa0The prostration of gratitude is one of the proven prophetic Sunnahs which many people neglect.\n3.\xa0The differing scholarly opinion as to whether the prostration of gratitude is prescribed is a view that is regarded as weak, because it goes against what is soundly narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and from many of his companions (may Allah be pleased with them) in that regard.\n4.\xa0The prostration of gratitude is prescribed every time the Muslims receive far reaching blessings or some suffering is warded off from them or ceases, or when a Muslim receives a blessing at an individual level, whether it was through his own efforts or not, and every time some evil is warded off from him.\nImam ash-Shawkani (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf you say: Allah’s blessings to His slaves are ongoing at every moment, I say: What is meant is new blessings which may or may not reach a person. Hence the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) only did the prostration of gratitude when new blessings were received, even though Allah’s blessings came to him constantly, at every moment.""(As-Sayl al-Jarrar\xa0 1/175).\n5.\xa0The correct view is that the prostration of gratitude is not subject to the same stipulations as for prayer, such as purifying oneself, covering one’s ‘awrah (which includes hijab for women), turning to face the qiblah, and so on.\nThis is the view of many of the early generations, and it is the view that was favoured by some of the Malikis and many of the other scholars, such as Ibn Jarir at-Tabari, Ibn Hazm, Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, Ibn al-Qayyim, ash-Shawkani and as-San‘ani. Many of our shaykhs regarded it as more likely to be correct, including Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn ‘Abdillah ibn Baz, Shaykh Muhammad ibn Salih ibn ‘Uthaymin, Shaykh ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Abd ar-Rahman ibn Jibrin (may Allah have mercy on them) and others.\nThis is in contrast to those who stipulated the same conditions for the prostration of gratitude as for supererogatory prayers, which is the view of the Shafa‘is and was also stated by most of the Hanbalis, some of the Hanafis and some of the Malikis.\nThe evidence quoted by those who held the first view includes the following:\n\nIn order to stipulate that purifying oneself or any of the other conditions of prayer are required in the case of the prostration of gratitude, evidence is needed, but there is no evidence, because there is nothing in the Qur’an or Sunnah to suggest that these things are required in the case of this prostration, and there is no scholarly consensus to that effect and no valid analogy. It is not permissible to enjoin on the ummah of Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) any rulings for which there is no evidence.\nThe apparent meaning of the hadith of Abu Bakrah – which says that if something happened to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that brought him joy, or he was given glad tidings, he would fall down in prostration in gratitude to Allah [narrated and classed as hasan by at-Tirmidhi (1578); also narrated by Abu Dawud (2774) and Ibn Majah (1394)] – and other hadiths in which it is narrated that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did the prostration of gratitude, indicates that he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not purify himself before doing this prostration. The fact that he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) fell down in prostration immediately indicates that he would prostrate in gratitude as soon as there was a reason for doing so, whether he was in a state of wudu’ or otherwise. This was also apparently the case with what his companions (may Allah be pleased with them) did.\nIf purifying oneself – or any of the other conditions of prayer – was required in order to do the prostration of gratitude, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would have explained that to his ummah, because they would need to know that. It is impossible that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) could have done this prostration and prescribed it for his ummah without prescribing purification or any other condition if it was required, and without instructing his companions to do that. But not a single letter has been reported from him regarding that.\nThe reason for doing the prostration of gratitude comes suddenly, and the one who wants to prostrate may not be in a state of purity; delaying the prostration of gratitude after the reason for it occurs, in order to do wudu’ or ghusl, would cause one to miss out on the appropriate time for doing it and would make it meaningless.\nThese conditions – being in a state of purity and so on – are only stipulated for the prayer. One of the proofs of that is the report narrated by Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came out of the privy and some food was brought to him. They suggested wudu’ to him and he said: “Am I going to pray, that I should do wudu’?” Narrated by Muslim (374). The prostration of gratitude is not prayer, because in the religious texts it is not called prayer, and because it does not involve doing one or two rak‘ahs. Moreover, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not prescribe for it any takbir or salaam, or forming rows, or being led by an imam, as he prescribed in the case of the funeral prayer, the two prostrations of forgetfulness after the salaam, and all other prayers. So there are no stipulated conditions for the prostration of gratitude as there are for the prayer.\nThe correct analogy is to compare a prostration that is done on its own to the recitations and adhkar that are said inside and outside of the prayer, such as recitation of Qur’an – which is the best part of the prayer and its words – and such as tasbih [saying “Subhan-Allah (Glory be to Allah)”], tahmid [saying “Al-hamdu Lillah (Praise be to Allah)”], takbir [saying “Allahu akbar (Allah is most great)”] and tahlil [saying “La ilaha illa Allah [there is no god worthy of worship except Allah)”]. Just as there is no stipulation of purification for these things if they are done outside of the prayer – even though they are all parts of the prayer – the same applies to the prostration that is done on its own.\n\nThe scholars of the Permanent Committee said:\nThe correct view is that there is no stipulation of being in a state of purity for the prostration of gratitude and the prostration of recitation, for the reciter or the listener, because they do not come under the same ruling as prayer.\nShaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baz, Shaykh ‘Abd ar-Razzaaq ‘Afifi, Shaykh ‘Abdullah ibn Qa‘ud.\nFatawa al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah (7/263).\n6.\xa0The more correct view regarding the way in which the prostration of gratitude is to be done is that it is not required to say takbir at the beginning or at the end, or to recite the tashahhud or to say the salaam. This is the stated view narrated from Imam ash-Shafa‘i, it is the view of Imam Ahmad in one report from him, and it is the view of some of the Shafa‘is, because there is no proof of that from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) or from any of his companions (may Allah be pleased with them).\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) was of the view that in this prostration it is not prescribe to recite any tashahhud or say any salaam; rather that is an innovation and it is not permissible to do it.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWith regard to the prostration of recitation and the prostration of gratitude, no one narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) or from his companions that any taslim is required in it, or that they used to say taslim following it. Hence Ahmad ibn Hanbal and other scholars did not speak of the taslim with regard to the prostration of gratitude. According to one of the two reports from him, Ahmad did not say the taslim following it, because there is no report that speaks of that. In the other report from him, it says that he said one or two taslims, but that is not proven by any religious text; rather it is on the basis of analogy. Similarly, those jurists who think that there should be a taslim do not have any text to support them; rather it is analogy or the view of some of the Tabi‘in.""(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa 21/277).\nAnd he (may Allah have mercy on him) said regarding the prostration of recitation and the prostration of gratitude:\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not call that prayer, and he did not prescribe forming rows, or being led by an imam, as he prescribed in the case of the funeral prayer, the two prostrations of forgetfulness after the salaam, and all other prayers. And the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not prescribe any salaam in this case, and that was not narrated from him in any report, sound or weak; rather it is an innovation. And he did not prescribe any opening takbir for it.""(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa\xa023/171).\n7.\xa0There is no specific dhikr that is required in the prostration of gratitude. Rather it is prescribed for the one who prostrates to say in his prostration whatever is appropriate to the situation, such as praising Allah, thanking Him, calling upon Him in supplication, seeking His forgiveness, and so on.\nAsh-Shawkani (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf you say: There is nothing in the hadiths to tell us what the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said in the prostration of gratitude, so what should the one who prostrates in gratitude say? I say: He should thank Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, a great deal, because this prostration is a prostration of gratitude.""(As-Sayl al-Jarrar\xa0 1/286).\n8.\xa0A person should not do the prostration of gratitude if he receives glad tidings whilst he is praying, because the reason for prostrating in this situation is not part of the prayer, and has nothing to do with it. So if he prostrates deliberately, that invalidates his prayer, as in the case of one who adds a prostration to the prayer deliberately, or prostrates during the prayer because of some mistake he made in a different prayer, or such as if he included another prayer in the prayer that he is doing. This is the view of the Shafa‘is and of most of the Hanbalis.\nSome of the Hanbalis said that it is recommended (mustahabb) to do the prostration of gratitude in this case [when one is praying], by analogy with the prostration of recitation. Their argument may be refuted as follows: What they mention of analogy is not valid, because it is making an analogy between two different things. The reason for the prostration of recitation is one of the actions of prayer, namely reciting Qur’an, whereas the reason for the prostration of gratitude is something outside of the prayer.\nShaykh Muhammad ibn Salih al-‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf someone does the prostration of gratitude during the prayer, when he is aware of the ruling and remembers it at that time, then his prayer is invalidated.…\nWhat they also mentioned is correct, namely that the prayer is invalidated by doing the prostration of gratitude, because it has nothing to do with the prayer, in contrast to the prostration of recitation, because the prostration of recitation is done for something that has to do with the prayer, namely reciting Qur’an.""(Ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘ ‘ala Zad al-Mustaqni‘\xa0 4/107, 108).\n9.\xa0The prostration of gratitude is prescribed for one who is riding a mount by gesturing and he may lean forward as much as possible.\n10.\xa0It is permissible to make up the prostration of gratitude later on, if it is not possible to do it right away.\nIf a person is given glad tidings or a blessing comes to him and he does not do the prostration of gratitude, and he has no excuse for not prostrating when the reason for it happens, then some of the scholars stated that it is not prescribed for him to make up this prostration later on. That is because he has no excuse for delaying it. See: Hashiyat al-Qalyubi (1/209).\nEnd quote.
