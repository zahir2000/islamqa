112110,"Some people write verses from the Quran and erase them with water, then drink the water. If I object to them, they say: It is the words of Allah and we are seeking healing by means of it. Is doing that permissible?","['Praise be to Allah.Doing that is permissible. It is permissible for a person to write Quran with ink that it is permissible to drink, then to put the written paper in water and shake it, then drink it. Some of the early generations used to do that, and they would do it using vessels such as bowls and the like. If a person does that, he has a precedent for doing it. The evidence quoted for doing that is the general meaning of the verse in which Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And We send down of the Quran that which is healing and mercy for the believers}\xa0[al-Isra’ 17:82].\nSo if healing is sought by means of the Quran in this manner, and it is tried and turns out to be beneficial, then it is included in the general meaning of this verse.\nShaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him).\n(Al-Liqa’ al-Maftuh (p. 112).']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/112110/writing-verses-of-quran-and-erasing-them-with-water-then-drinking-the-water
47761,"A person owns a piece of land and one year has passed since he acquired it. Zakah is due because it comes under the heading of trade goods (i.e., he bought it in order to sell it). How should he pay Zakah on it? Please note that he only has a little cash, very little.","['Praise be to Allah.Is there Zakah on business goods?\nZakah is due on trade goods according to the Quran and Sunnah. In the Quran, this is indicated by the general meaning of the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“O you who believe! Spend of the good things which you have (legally) earned, and of that which We have produced from the earth for you.”\xa0[Al-Baqarah 2:267]\nMujahid said: “Spend of the good things which you have (legally) earned” means trade. \xa0\nWith regard to evidence from the Sunnah, Abu Dawud narrated (1562) that Samurah ibn Jundub (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to command us to give Zakah from that which we had prepared for sale .\xa0\nThe Isnad of this Hadith is subject to some discussion, but some of the scholars classed it as sound, such as Ibn `Abd Al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him), and it is the view that the scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas adopted.\xa0(See Fatawa Al-Lajnah Al-Da’imah, 9/331)\xa0\nConditions of Zakah on trade goods\nZakah is due on things that have been prepared for trade if they reach the Nisab (minimum threshold) and one (lunar) year has passed (since they were acquired).\xa0\nHow to calculate Zakah on trade goods\nBased on this, Zakah must be paid on the land which has been in your possession for a year; you have to determine the value of the land at the end of the year, and pay one-quarter of ten percent . So if its value is one hundred thousand (100,000) Dinars, for example, you have to pay Zakah of 2.5% or two and a half thousand (2,500), and so on.\xa0\nWhat happens if you don\'t have cash to pay Zakah on trade goods?\nIf you have cash, then you must pay it and it is not permissible to delay paying Zakah until the land is sold . But if you do not have cash with which to pay the Zakah, then it becomes a debt that you owe and must be paid when it becomes possible to do so. If you cannot do it until you sell the land, then you have to pay Zakah from the price you receive for the land for each year in which Zakah was due.\xa0\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Zakah is due on land that is prepared for trade. The evidence for that is the well-known Hadith of Samurah ibn Jundub (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to command us to give Zakah from that which we had prepared for sale.”\xa0\nHe also said:\xa0\n“If land and other similar things such as houses and cars, etc. are prepared for sale, then you must pay Zakah on them each year according to their value, when one full (lunar) year has passed. It is not permissible to delay that, except in the case of one who is unable to pay the Zakah on them because he does not have any other wealth. Then he may be given a respite until he sells it and pays the Zakah for all the years, each year according to its value at the end of that year, regardless of whether the value is more than the price he gets for it or is less than the price for which he bought the land, car or house.""

This is what a specialist told us.\nIt says on the website of the Cooperative for the Development of the Apiculture Industry in Riyadh:\nHoney Fermentation\n\nHoney will ferment if the moisture in it increases beyond 19-21%, especially when cutting away honey that is not ripe, or adding water to it.\nRipe honey could be preserved for a long time without fermentation. As for honey that is not ripe, or honey that is kept in places where moisture is high, it is exposed to the risk of fermentation due to the impact of some yeasts that carry high concentrations of sugar. The sources of these yeasts include pollen, air and dust.\nThe yeasts that are present in honey may secrete enzymes that turn sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. These alcohols may be broken down, due to the effect of bacteria and oxygen in the air, into acetic acid and water.\nFermented honey loses its natural smell and taste, and develops a sour smell. Foam and air bubbles may develop in it.

12601,"If someone reaches Jumu`ah during the Tashahhud, what should he do? If someone is held up by something out of his control eg. bus breaks down... is he sinful if he is late to Jumu`ah or misses it? Does he miss out on the rewards he would have gotten and the moment of the acceptance of Du`a, etc.?","['Praise be to Allah.How to catch up with Friday prayer\nYou can only catch up with the Jumu`ah prayer if you catch a Rak`ah with the Imam, and catching a Rak`ah means catching up with the Ruku` with the Imam.\nIf you catch up with the Imam before he stands up from Ruku` in the second Rak`ah, then you have caught up with the prayer, and you should then complete your prayer after the Imam says the Salam. You should stand up and complete the remaining Rak`ah of your prayer.\xa0\nHowever, if you catch up with the Imam after he has stood up from Ruku`, this means that you have missed the Jumu`ah prayer, and have not caught up with it. In this case you have to pray it as Zuhr. You should stand up after the Imam has said the Salam and complete your prayer with four Rak`ahs, because it is Zuhr and not Jumu`ah.\xa0\nThis is the view of the majority of scholars, Malik, Al-Shafi`i and Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on them). (See Al-Majmu’ by Al-Nawawi, 4/558)\nThey quoted several texts as evidence, such as:\xa0\n\nThe words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Whoever catches up with one Rak`ah of the prayer has caught up with the prayer.” (Al-Bukhari, 580; Muslim, 607).\xa0\nThe report narrated by Al-Nasa’i from ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Whoever catches up with one Rak`ah of Jumu`ah or any other prayer, let him add more Rak`ahs to it to complete his prayer.’” (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Al-Irwa’, 622).\xa0\n\nMissing the prayer for a valid excuse\nIf a person does not catch up with the prayer for a reason that is beyond his control, such as the bus breaking down, as mentioned in the question, or other excuses such as oversleeping or forgetting, then there is no sin on him in that case, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And there is no sin on you concerning that in which you made a mistake, except in regard to what your hearts deliberately intend” [Al-Ahzab 33:5]\nA person in such cases does not deliberately intend to miss the prayer .\xa0\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has forgiven my Ummah for what they forget and what they do by mistake, and for what they are forced to do.” (Narrated by Ibn Majah; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Al-Irwa’, 82)\xa0\nIn this case, if one is sincere in his resolve to pray, but has an excuse, he will earn the reward in full, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Actions are (recompensed) by intentions, and every person will have but that which he intended.” (Al-Bukhari, 1; Muslim, 1907)\xa0\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) also said to his companions on the way back from the battle of Tabuk: “In Madinah there are men who, whenever you cover a distance or cross a valley, they share the reward with you; they have been detained by sickness.” (Muslim, 1911)\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12601/joining-the-jumuah-prayer-during-tashahhud
