444120,"Is it permissible for us to go to public places which are permissible to go to in and of themselves, such as libraries and cafés, where there are pictures on the walls or statues, and also places where they play music, if the individual is not able to put a stop to it? Or should he not go to these places?","['Praise be to Allah.The one who reflects on the state of people nowadays will realise that there is hardly any public place but there will be some objectionable matters in it, to a greater or lesser extent, and this is becoming a widespread problem, which makes some people reluctant to go to these places when there is a need to go to them, whether that is because of a necessity or a need, or for some other reason.\nWhat appears to be the case – and Allah knows best – is that the issue needs some discussion, and it is not right to issue one ruling to cover all places, situations and people.\nFirstly:\nThere are public places that people cannot avoid going to, otherwise it will be detrimental to their well-being, such as hospitals, workplaces and public transit. It is not possible to prevent people from going to such places because of what may be present in them of matters that are objectionable according to Islamic teachings.\nHowever, the individual is required to avoid going to them as much as possible. So in the case of those places that he can avoid going to without that causing him undue hardship and inconvenience, he is required to refrain from going to them and to keep away from them. In the case of those places that he needs to go to, he should strive to not let himself be affected by any objectionable matters in those places, when he does need to go to them. So he should not look at or listen attentively to those objectionable matters, and so on, as much as he can avoid them, and he should seek Allah’s forgiveness for what he could not avoid of those objectionable matters.\nThis was the practice of the Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) in dealing with that which it is very difficult to avoid. It was narrated from Abu Ayyub al-Ansari that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When you go to relieve yourselves, do not face towards the qiblah or turn your backs towards it, whether you are urinating or defecating; rather face towards the east or west.” Abu Ayyub said: We came to Syria and we found latrines that had been built facing towards the qiblah. So we turned ourselves away and asked Allah for forgiveness. Narrated by Muslim (264).\nThe Permanent Committee were asked about similar things and they replied:\nIf you cannot put a stop to music on the bus, and you need to take the bus because the distance is far and you have no other means of transportation, then there is no blame on you for that, but you must denounce the evil as much as you can, even if that is only in your heart.""(Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Da’imah\xa026/241).\nSecondly:\nWith regard to places where the main activity is the open practice of objectionable and haram things, such as parties with music in which there is a combination of music, immodesty and free mixing, then the ruling on such places is that it is haram to go there, whether by oneself or with one’s family and children. More emphatically prohibited are places that are set up for the objectionable and haram matters that are done in those places.\nIt is haram for the Muslim to organise parties or celebrations which involve objectionable and haram matters such as singing, music, mixing between men and women, and bringing charlatans and magicians to perform, because of the abundant religious texts which indicate that these things are prohibited, and that they are causes of falling into what Allah has prohibited of immoral and evil acts.\nAllah, may He be glorified and exalted, has warned those who like to see immorality spread among the believers, and those who promote and help in such things, of a painful punishment, as He, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Indeed, those who like that immorality should be spread [or publicized] among those who have believed will have a painful punishment in this world and the Hereafter}\xa0[Al-Nur 24:19].\nOnce it is established that organising such parties and celebrations is haram, we should understand that attending them is also haram, because it is a waste of money and time on things with which Allah, may He be glorified, is not pleased, and it comes under the heading of cooperating in sin and transgression. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And cooperate in righteousness and piety, but do not cooperate in sin and transgression. And fear Allah; indeed, Allah is severe in penalty}\xa0[Al-Ma’idah 5:2].\nConcerning that, there is also the hadith of which the soundness is agreed upon, according to which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to forbid wasting wealth.""(Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Da’imah\xa026/225).\nThirdly:\nWith regard to places which were basically set up for permissible leisure, such as public parks and seafronts (corniches), there may be some objectionable and haram matters in these places, such as immodesty and the like, but not everyone who goes there will necessarily be affected by that. Hence preventing people from going to such places is obviously too strict and causes extra hardship for people, as their need for such places has become something essential nowadays.\nSo there is nothing wrong with going to such places; however the individual should make sure that his conduct and that of the people with him, and anyone over whom he has any authority, is appropriate and is in accordance with Islamic teachings. And he should strive to make sure that neither he nor his family or those who are with him get involved in anything that is objectionable and haram. So he should avoid taking part in any objectionable matter or watching it, and he should try to forbid any evils that he sees around him as much as he is able to.\nThe greatest good conduct that he should try to do in the places to which he goes out and during his leisure time is establishing prayer on time. Perhaps with the presence of good people, evil will be reduced. This is something that we see in real life. You will find a man giving the adhan in such places, and other people will follow him and pray with him. The reason why they get up and join him is because of his adhan and his openly giving the call to pray in congregation. When evil people find a righteous person in such places, or they see women observing correct shar‘i hijab, many of them will be influenced by those righteous people, especially those who have not yet become fully accustomed to bad conduct. One should also offer advice and exhortation to whomever he can advise and exhort in those places of those who are doing objectionable things. However, we should be keen to seek out the times and places where objectionable and haram matters are least expected.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The prohibitions relating to listening to what is not appropriate have to do with what one actively listens to and focuses on, not merely hearing it. Something similar applies to looking at what is not appropriate; the prohibition has to do with looking deliberately, not an involuntary glance… The same applies to doing haram deeds that involve any of the five senses, namely hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting and touching. The prohibitions apply to when one intentionally and actively does those things. As for what happens involuntarily, the prohibitions do not apply to it.""(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa\xa0 5/566).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/444120/what-is-the-ruling-on-going-to-public-places-where-there-are-objectionable-things
121948,What is the virtue of Ahl al-Bayt and their superiority over other people? Will they intercede for the people on the Day of Resurrection?,"['Praise be to Allah.Who are Ahl Al-Bayt?\nIn the answer to question no.\xa010055 ,\xa0we explained that Ahl Al-Bayt are the members of the household of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). At the end of that answer we said:\xa0\n“So the family members of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) are: his wives, his children, and Banu Hashim, Banu `Abd Al-Muttalib and their freed slaves.”\xa0\nRights of Ahl Al-Bayt\nAllah has bestowed upon the Ahl al-Bayt of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) numerous virtues. Ahl As-Sunnah wa’l-Jama`ah are unanimously agreed that it is obligatory to love them and respect their rights. \xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Similarly the family of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) have rights which must be paid attention to. Allah has allocated to them a share of the khums and fay’, and He has enjoined that blessings be sent upon them along with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), who said to us: “Say: ‘Allahumma salli ‘ala Muhammadin wa ‘ala ali Muhammadin kama salayta ‘ala ali Ibrahim, innaka Hamidun Majid, wa barik ‘ala Muhammadin wa ‘ala ali Muhammadin kama barakta ‘ala ali Ibrahim innaka Hamidun Majid (O Allah, send prayer upon Muhammad and upon the family of Muhammad, as You sent prayers upon the family of Ibrahim; You are indeed Worthy of Praise, Full of Glory. And send blessings upon Muhammad and upon the family of Muhammad, as You sent blessings upon the family of Ibrahim; You are indeed Worthy of Praise, Full of Glory)’”. (Majmu’ Al-Fatawa, 3/407)\xa0\nAnd he also said:\xa0\n“Similarly, with regard to the family of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) (Ahl Al-Bayt), it is obligatory to love them, be loyal to them and respect their rights.” (Majmu’ Al-Fatawa, 28/491)\nVirtues of Ahl Al-Bayt\nThe virtues of the family of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) are:\xa0\n\nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n“O wives of the Prophet! You are not like any other women. If you keep your duty (to Allah), then be not soft in speech, lest he in whose heart is a disease (of hypocrisy, or evil desire for adultery) should be moved with desire, but speak in an honourable manner. And stay in your houses, and do not display yourselves like that of the times of ignorance, And perform As-Salah (Iqamat-As-Salah), and give Zakah and obey Allah and His Messenger. Allah wishes only to remove Ar-Rijs (evil deeds and sins) from you, O members of the family (of the Prophet), and to purify you with a thorough purification.” [Al-Ahzab 33:32, 33]\nThis does not apply only to the Prophet’s wives (may Allah be pleased with them); rather it is narrated in the sahih Sunnah that it also includes others. It was narrated that ’Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said:\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) went out one morning wearing a striped cloak of black camel hair. Al-Hasan ibn ‘Ali came and he enfolded him in the cloak, then al-Husayn came and he enfolded him in it, then Fatimah came and he enfolded her in it, then ‘Ali came and he enfolded him in it, then he said: “Allah wishes only to remove Ar-Rijs (evil deeds and sins) from you, O members of the family (of the Prophet), and to purify you with a thorough purification.” [Al-Ahzab 33:33]\xa0 \xa0(Narrated by Muslim, 2424)\xa0\n\nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n“The Prophet is closer to the believers than their own selves, and his wives are their (believers’) mothers (as regards respect and marriage).” [Al-Ahzab 33:6]\n\nIt was narrated that Wathilah ibn Al-Asqa’ said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say:\n\n“Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, chose Kinanah from among the children of Isma’il (peace be upon him), and He chose Quraysh from among Kinanah, and He chose Banu Hashim from among Quraysh, and He chose me from among Banu Hashim.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2276)\xa0\n\nIt was narrated that Zayd ibn Arqam said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stood and addressed us at a watering place called Khumm, between Makkah and Madinah. He praised and glorified Allah, and he exhorted and reminded us, then he said: “O people, I am only human, and soon the messenger of my Lord will come to me and I will respond. I am leaving among you two weighty things, the first of which is the Book of Allah in which is guidance and light. Follow the Book of Allah and hold fast to it.” And he encouraged us to adhere to the Book of Allah, then he said: “And the people of my household, I remind you of Allah with regard to the people of my household, I remind you of Allah with regard to the people of my household, I remind you of Allah with regard to the people of my household.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2408)\xa0\n\nThe Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) paid attention to this commandment; foremost among them were Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq and `Umar ibn Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with them).\xa0\nAl-Bukhari (3508) and Muslim (1759) narrated that Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) said to ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him): “By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, kinship with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is dearer to me than kinship with my own people.”\xa0\nAl-Bukhari also narrated in his Sahih (3509) that Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “Pay attention to the rights of the household of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).”\xa0\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“The words “Pay attention to the rights of the household of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)” are addressed to the people, enjoining them to fulfill the rights of Ahl Al-Bayt.” (Fath Al-Bari, 7/79)\xa0\nWith regard to the respect of `Umar ibn Al-Khattaab for the relatives of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), that is apparent from many things, such as his preferring to put the ahead of himself or any other people with regard to allocating shares from bayt al-mal.\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Moreover, when ‘Umar ibn Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) set up the registry of stipends, he wrote\xa0 down people’s names according to their lineage, so he started with those who were closest in lineage to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), When he had finished listing the Arabs, he listed the non-Arabs. This is how the registry was at the time of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs, and all the caliphs of the Umayyad and ‘Abbasid dynasties, until things changed after that.” \xa0(Iqtida’ Al-Sirat Al-Mustaqim, p. 159, 160)\xa0\nWill Ahl Al-Bayt intercede on the Day of Resurrection?\xa0\nThere is no intercession specifically for the family of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), rather that is something that may be granted to all those among the righteous, the martyrs and the scholars with whose intercession Allah is pleased, whether they are among Ahl Al-Bayt or are from among the ordinary people.\xa0\nIn the answer to question no.\xa021672 ,\xa0we said: “Intercession for those who committed sin will not be granted only to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), rather the prophets, the martyrs, the scholars, the righteous and the angels will also join in that. A man’s righteous deeds may also intercede for him. But the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) will have the greatest share of intercession.”\nThus we may know the response to the extremists among the Rafidis who claim that intercession is only for the family of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Rather it is stated in their books that Ahl Al-Bayt are the ones who will admit people to Paradise and to Hell! This is just part of a lengthy list of the different types of exaggeration that they have, the source of which is their ignorance of the religion of Allah, may He be exalted, and their keeping away from the texts of Revelation in the Quran and Sunnah.\xa0\nWe advise you to read an essay entitled Fadl Ahl Al-Bayt wa ‘Uluw Makanatihim ‘inda Ahl Al-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah, written by Shaykh ‘Abd Al-Muhsin ibn Hamad Al-‘Abbad Al-Badr, which we have benefited from in composing this answer, and which contains additional research on this topic.

42216,I would like to ask a question about `Aqeedah. Is it part of our `Aqeedah to believe that the Prophets committed sins and were not infallible?,"[""Praise be to Allah.Are Prophets infallible?\nThe Prophets are the best of mankind, and the most noble of creation before Allah. Allah chose them to convey the call of La ilaha ill-Allah (none has the right to be worshipped but Allah) to mankind, and Allah has made them the intermediaries between Him and His creation in conveying His Laws. They were commanded to convey the message from Allah, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n\xa0“They are those whom We gave the Book, Al-Hukm (understanding of the religious laws), and Prophethood. But if these disbelieve therein (the Book, Al-Hukm and Prophethood), then, indeed We have entrusted it to a people (such as the Companions of Prophet Muhammad) who are not disbelievers therein.” [Al-An`am 6:89]\xa0\nThe Prophets’ task was to convey the message from Allah even though they were human, hence the issue of infallibility may be examined from two angles:\xa0\n\nInfallibility in conveying the message\nInfallibility from human error\xa0\n\nInfallibility of Prophets in conveying the message\nThe Prophets were infallible in conveying the message from Allah. They did not conceal anything that Allah had revealed to them, and they did not add anything from themselves. Allah said to His Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n\xa0“O Messenger (Muhammad)! Proclaim (the Message) which has been sent down to you from your Lord. And if you do not, then you have not conveyed His Message. Allah will protect you from mankind.” [Al-Ma'idah 5:67]\xa0\n“And if he (Muhammad) had forged a false saying concerning Us (Allah), We surely would have seized him by his right hand (or with power and might), \xa0And then We certainly would have cut off his life artery (aorta), And none of you could have withheld Us from (punishing) him.” [Al-Haqqah 69:44-47]\nAllah also says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And he (Muhammad) withholds not a knowledge of the Unseen.” [Al-Takwir 81:24]\nShaykh `Abd Ar-Rahman ibn Sa`di (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his commentary on this verse: “He is not stingy with that which Allah has revealed to him, concealing some of it. Rather he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was the most trustworthy of the inhabitants of heaven and the people of earth, the one who conveys the message of his Lord, the faithful conveyor (of the message). He does not withhold any part of it, from rich or poor, from ruler or subject, from male or female, from city-dweller or Bedouin. Hence Allah sent him to an illiterate and ignorant nation, and he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not die until they had become knowledgeable scholars, steeped in knowledge…”\nThus, with regard to conveying the religion of his Lord, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not make any mistakes at all, whether major or minor, rather he was infallible and under the constant protection of Allah.\xa0\nShaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Fatawa Ibn Baz, (6/371):\xa0\n“All the Muslims are unanimously agreed that the Prophets (peace be upon them) – especially Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) – are infallible and protected from error in that which they conveyed from Allah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“By the star when it goes down (or vanishes). Your companion (Muhammad) has neither gone astray nor has erred. Nor does he speak of (his own) desire. It is only a Revelation revealed. He has been taught (this Quran) by one mighty in power [Gabriel].” [An-Najm 53:1-5]\nOur Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is infallible in all that he conveyed from Allah, in word and action and in what he approved of. There is no dispute on this point among the scholars.”\nThe Ummah agreed that the Messengers are infallible in their conveying the message. They did not forget anything that Allah revealed to them, except for things that were abrogated. Moreover, Allah guaranteed His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that he would remember it and would not forget it, except for that which Allah wanted him to forget, and He guaranteed that he would remember the whole Quran in his heart. Allah said (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“We shall make you recite (the Quran), so you (O Muhammad) shall not forget (it).” [Al-A’la 87:7]\xa0\n“It is for Us to collect it and to give you (O Muhammad) the ability to recite it (the Quran). And when We have recited it to you [O Muhammad through Jibreel (Gabriel)], then follow its (the Quran’s) recitation.” [Al-Qiyamah 75:17-18]\nShaykh Al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him)] said in Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 18/7]:\xa0\n“The verses which point to the Prophethood of the Prophets indicate that they are infallible with regard to the message that they convey from Allah, so what they convey from their Lord can only be true. This is the meaning of Prophethood and this implies that Allah tells [the Prophet] of the unseen and he tells the people of the unseen. So the Messenger is commanded to call people and to convey the message to them.”\xa0\nInfallibility of the Prophets from human errors\nWith regard to the Prophets as people, they may make mistakes. This may be discussed as follows:\xa0\nThey do not commit major sins\nWith regard to major sins, the Prophets do not commit major sins at all , and they are protected from such major sins both before their missions began or afterwards.\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 4/319:\xa0\n“The view that the Prophets are infallible and protected against committing major sins , as opposed to minor sins, is the view of the majority of Muslim scholars and of all groups. It is also the view of the scholars of Tafsir and Hadith and jurists. Indeed, nothing has been narrated from any of the Salaf, Imams, the Companions, the generation after them, and those who followed them except that which is in accordance with this view.”\xa0\nMatters that have nothing to do with conveying the message and the revelation\xa0\nWith regard to minor sins, these may be committed by them, or by some of them. Hence the majority of scholars are of the view that they are not infallible when it comes to minor sins. Nonetheless, if they committed such actions they were not left to persist therein, rather Allah pointed that out to them and they hastened to repent therefrom.\xa0\nThe evidence that they might commit minor sins and that they were not left to persist therein is:\n\nThe verses in which Allah says of Adam (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n\n“Thus did Adam disobey his Lord, so he went astray. \xa0Then his Lord chose him, and turned to him with forgiveness, and gave him guidance.” [Ta-Ha 20:121-122]\xa0\nThis indicates that Adam committed sin, but he was not left to persist therein, and he repented to Allah from that.\xa0\n\nAlso, Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n\n“He said: `This is of Satan’s doing, verily, he is a plain misleading enemy.’ He said: `My Lord! Verily, I have wronged myself, so forgive me.’ Then He forgave him. Verily, He is the Oft-Forgiving, the Most Merciful.” [Al-Qasas 28:15-16]\nSo Moses (peace be upon him) confessed his sin and sought forgiveness from Allah after he killed the Egyptian, and Allah forgave him his sin.\n\nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n\n“…and he [Dawud] sought forgiveness of his Lord, and he fell down prostrate and turned (to Allah) in repentance. So We forgave him that, and verily, for him is a near access to Us, and a good place of (final) return (Paradise).” [Sad 38:23-24]\nDawud’s sin was hastening to pass judgement before hearing the case of the second disputant.\n\nOur Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was rebuked by his Lord for several things that are mentioned in the Quran, such as the following (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n\n\xa0“O Prophet! Why do you forbid (for yourself) that which Allah has allowed to you, seeking to please your wives? And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” [At-Tahrim 66:1]\nThis refers to the well-known story with some of his wives.\n\nAllah also rebuked His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) concerning the prisoners of war at Badr:\xa0\n\nMuslim (4588) narrated that Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: When the prisoners were taken captive, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to Abu Bakr and `Umar (may Allah be pleased with them): “What do you think about these prisoners?” Abu Bakr said: “O Prophet of Allah, they are our cousins and kinsmen. I think that we should accept a ransom from them which will give us some support against the disbelievers, and perhaps Allah will guide them to Islam.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “What do you think, O Ibn Al-Khattab?” He said: “I say, no, by Allah, O Messenger of Allah. I do not agree with Abu Bakr. I think that you should hand them over to us so that we may strike their necks (execute them). Hand over `Aqil to `Ali so that he may strike his neck, and hand over So and so – a relative of `Umar – to me, for these are the leaders and veterans of disbelief.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) liked what Abu Bakr said and he did not like what I [`Umar] said. The next day I came and found the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and Abu Bakr weeping. I said: “O Messenger of Allah, tell me, what has made you and your companion weep? If there is a reason to weep, I will weep with you, and there is no reason, I will force myself to weep in sympathy with you because you are weeping.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I am weeping because I was shown the torture to which they were subjected. It was brought as close to me as this tree” – a tree which was near the Prophet of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) – then Allah revealed the words (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“It is not for a Prophet that he should have prisoners of war (and free them with ransom) until he had made a great slaughter (among his enemies) in the land. You desire the good of this world (i.e. the money of ransom for freeing the captives), but Allah desires (for you) the Hereafter. And Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.\nWere it not a previous ordainment from Allah, a severe torment would have touched you for what you took.\nSo enjoy what you have gotten of booty in war, lawful and good.” [Al-Anfal 8:67-69]\nSo Allah permitted booty to them.\xa0\nFrom this Hadith it is clear that when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) chose to ransom the prisoners, this was a decision that he made by Ijtihad after consulting his companions, and he had no revelation from Allah concerning that.\xa0\n\nThe words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n\n“(The Prophet) frowned and turned away.\nBecause there came to him the blind man (i.e. `Abdullah ibn Umm Maktum, who came to the Prophet while he was preaching to one or some of the Quraysh chiefs).” [`Abas 80:1-2]\nThis is the famous story of the great companion `Abdullah ibn Umm Maktum (may Allah be pleased with him) and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), when Allah rebuked him.\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Majmoo’ Al-Fatawa (4/320):\xa0\n“What has been narrated from the majority of scholars is that they (the Prophets) are not infallible with regard to minor sins, but they are not left to persist therein. They do not say that this does not happen under any circumstances. The first group from whom it was narrated that they are infallible in all cases, and who say that the most, are the Rafidis (Shi’ah), who say that they are infallible and protected even against forgetfulness and misunderstanding.”\xa0\nSome people think this is too much to suggest that Prophets may commit sin, and misinterpret some of the texts of the Quran and Sunnah which indicate that. Two specious arguments lead them to do that:\xa0\n\nThe fact that Allah has commanded us to follow the Messengers and take them as our example. The command to follow them is taken as meaning that everything they did is an example for us to follow, and that every action and belief of theirs is an act of worship. If we suggest that that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) committed a sin, there will be a dilemma, because that implies that we are commanded to imitate this sin which was committed by the Prophet because we are commanded to follow his example, but at the same time we should no agree with it or do it, because it is a sin. \xa0\n\nThis argument is valid and is appropriate if the sin is hidden and not obvious in such a way that it could be confused with acts of obedience. But Allah has explained to His Messengers where they went wrong and enabled them to repent without delay.\xa0\n\nSins contradict perfection and are a shortcoming. This is true if they are not accompanied by repentance, for repentance brings forgiveness of sin, and does not contradict perfection or bring blame upon a person. Rather in many cases a person may be better after repenting than he was before he fell into sin. It is well known that no Prophet committed sin but he hastened to repent and seek forgiveness. The Prophets did not persist in sin or delay repentance, for Allah protected them from that, and after repenting they became more perfect than they were before.\xa0 \xa0\n\nUnintentional mistakes with regard to some worldly matters\nWith regard to mistakes in some worldly matters, it is permissible for them to make such mistakes although their reason is sound and their insight is strong. This happened to several of the Prophets including our Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). This happened with regard to various spheres of life such as medicine, agriculture, etc.\xa0\nMuslim (6127) narrated that Rafi ibn Khadij (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came to Madinah and found them pollinating the palm trees. He said: “What are you doing?” They said: “We always do this.” He said: “Perhaps if you do not do it, that will be better.” So they did not do it, and the harvest failed. They told him about that and he said: “I am only human. If I tell you to do something with regard to your religion, then do it, but if I tell you to do something based on my own opinion, then I am only human.” Hence it is known that the Prophets are infallible and protected from error with regard to the Revelation, so we should beware of those who cast aspersions upon the Messenger’s conveying of the Message and about laws he legislated, and say that it is his own personal opinion. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) could never do such a thing.

174279,"My question has to do with contraception using modern methods, which is done by using a rubber ring containing hormones that prevent pregnancy, by preventing the egg that has been fertilised from attaching itself to the wall of the uterus. Please note that other types of contraception prevent ovulation, and they differ from the first type by preventing fertilisation. Is the modern method mentioned above halal or haram? Please note that my question is not about contraception in and of itself; rather it is about this modern method.","['Praise be to Allah.The contraceptive rings work like pills, meaning that they prevent ovulation and prevent the fertilised egg from attaching to the wall of the uterus. On the website Tabib al-Web it says:\nThe\xa0vaginal ring\xa0is a flexible transparent\xa0copolymer\xa0ring, the diameter of which is 54 mm.\nThe woman herself places the ring in the vagina, where it remains for three weeks. In fact this ring contains a hormonal substance that is similar to what is found in contraceptive pills. The ring may remain in the vagina for three weeks, but the woman may remove it and wash it, then put it back in place easily. At the end of three weeks, the woman removes the ring, then waits for one whole week, like any woman who takes the contraceptive pill, then she inserts a new ring.\nThe way in which this method works is like the contraceptive pill, even though it is placed in the vagina; its effect is not localised, like other, local contraceptive methods; rather it works like the contraceptive pill, and placing it in the vagina is no more than a method of introducing the pharmaceutical substance into the body. In other words, these rings prevent ovulation from occurring, and make the interior of the uterus unreceptive to implantation of the egg. It also makes the cervical mucus unreceptive to the passage of sperm. End quote.\nThese rings share with other contraceptive methods – such as the IUD – the effect of preventing the fertilised egg from implanting in the uterus.\nIn the source quoted above it says: The way in which the IUD prevents pregnancy is by preventing the fertilised egg from implanting in the uterus.\nThe principle on which the copper IUD works is based on producing an inflammatory reaction that is not caused by germs; rather it is caused by the copper inside the uterus, as if the uterus is defending itself against the copper, so its make-up changes and it becomes unreceptive to implantation of the fertilised egg. This is in contrast to the hormonal IUD, which works by means of the pharmaceutical substance that the IUD releases inside the uterus and causes it to shrink.\nIn either case, the interior of the uterus becomes unreceptive to implantation of the fertilised egg. End quote.\nWe have previously explained that it is permissible to use the IUD to prevent pregnancy. Please see the answer to question no. 22027 .\nPreventing the egg from implanting in the uterus is not regarded as abortion, because abortion has to do with the fertilized egg that is implanted in the uterus, and this method prevents that from happening.\nAl-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his Tafsir: The nutfah (fertilised egg) is nothing, for certain, and no ruling is applied to it if the woman gets rid of it when it has not yet settled (implanted) in the womb, as it is regarded the same as if it is in the man’s loins. But if the woman gets rid of it when it is an ‘alaqah (embryo), then in that case we are certain that the nutfah had settled and begun to develop, in the first stage of development that leads to the formation of a child. End quote.\nAl-Ramli said in Nihayat al-Muhtaj (8/342): al-Muhibb al-Tabari said: The scholars differed regarding the fertilized egg before the completion of forty days, and there are two views. It was said that it is not subject to the rulings on abortion and infanticide, and it was said that it has sanctity and it is not permissible to harm it or cause it to be expelled after it has settled (implanted) in the womb. This is in contrast to ‘azl (coitus interruptus), because that happens before the sperm is deposited in the vagina… The more correct view is that it (abortion) is haram after the soul has been breathed into the foetus in all circumstances, but it is permissible before that. End quote.\nThe action of the IUD and the rings asked about is not regarded as abortion. Moreover, some of the jurists permit abortion of the fertilised egg before forty days, as was stated by al-Ramli and as has been explained previously in the answer to question no. 171943 .\nHence some contemporary scholars permitted the use of contraception based on the fact that ‘azl is permissible, and it is permissible to abort the fertilised egg before forty days, as if that indicates that it is permissible to use the IUD and similar methods.\nIt says in Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Da’imah (19/297): If contraception is used for a definite necessity – such as if the woman is not able to give birth naturally and must undergo a surgical procedure to extract the child, or if it is done to delay pregnancy for a while due to a valid reason that the spouses deem to be important – there is nothing wrong in that case with preventing or delaying pregnancy, based on what is narrated in the sahih hadiths and what was narrated from a number of the Sahabah about the permissibility of ‘azl, and in accordance with what the jurists have stated about it being permissible to take medicine in order to abort a fertilised egg before forty days have elapsed, and in fact it may become necessary to use contraception when it is proven that there is a strong reason for doing so.

82968,I am a young man and I do not want to get married. What should I do?,"['Praise be to Allah.Is marriage compulsory in Islam?\nYou should note that people are not equal in the matter of marriage. They share the fundamental principle that marriage is prescribed, which is from the guidance and practice of the Prophet, peace be upon him. Then, its importance varies in some cases more than others.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\nWith regard to marriage , people are of three types:\xa0\n\nSome fear that they may commit prohibited things if they do not get married. Such a person is obliged to get married, according to the majority of jurists, because he has to keep himself chaste and protect himself against engaging in prohibited actions, and the way to do that is getting married.\xa0\nFor some, marriage is recommended. This is the one who feels desire but there is no danger of his committing prohibited things. It is better for him to get married than to devote himself to optional acts of worship. This is the view of Ashab Ar-Ra`y and it is the view\xa0 and practice of the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them).\xa0\n\nIbn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: If I only had ten days to live and I knew that I would die at the end of them, and I had any desire to get married, I would get married, for fear of Fitnah (temptation).\xa0\nSa`id ibn Jubayr (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said to me: “Have you gotten married?” \xa0\nI said: “No.”\xa0He (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Get married, for the best of this Ummah are the ones with the most wives.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 5069)\xa0\nIbrahim ibn Maysarah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Tawus said to me: “Either get married, or I will say to you what `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said to Abu Az-Zawa’id (may Allah have mercy on him): Nothing is keeping you from getting married except impotence or immorality.” \xa0\n\nThose who have no desire, either because they were not created with any desire, such as one who is impotent, or they had desire but it has disappeared due to old age, sickness and so on. There are two opinions:\xa0\n\n\nIt is recommended to get married because of the general meaning of what we have discussed.\nIt is better for him to remain single because he cannot achieve the purpose of marriage, and he would be preventing his wife from becoming chaste by marrying someone else. Also, he would be harming her by keeping her for himself, and he is exposing himself to obligations and duties that perhaps he cannot fulfil, and he is distracting himself from seeking knowledge and worship with something that is of no benefit to him.\n\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The apparent meaning of the words of Ahmad is that there is no difference between the one who can afford it and the one who cannot. He said: a man should get married and if he can afford to spend he should spend, and if he cannot then he should be patient. \xa0\nThis applies to one who is able to get married. As for the one who cannot, Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And let those who find not the financial means for marriage keep themselves chaste, until Allah enriches them of His Bounty” [An-Nur 24:33].” (Al-Mughni, 9/341-344)\xa0\nReasons why marriage is so important\nAt this point, we would like to ask you about the reason for this aversion to marriage.\xa0\n\nIf you think that not getting married is an act of worship by means of which you can draw closer to the Lord of the Worlds, and you think that if you avoid marriage this will raise you in status before Allah, you are mistaken and there is the fear that you may be sinning.\xa0\n\nAnas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “Three people came to the houses of the wives of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asking about the worship of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). When they were told, it was as if they regarded it as too little. They said: Who are we in comparison to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)? Allah has forgiven his past and future sins. One of them said: As for me, I will pray all night forever. Another said: I shall fast all my life and never break my fast. Another said: I shall keep away from women and never get married. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came and said: “Are you the ones who said such and such? By Allah, I am the one who fears Allah the most among you and I am the most pious , but I fast and I break my fast, I pray and I sleep, and I marry women. Whoever turns away from my Sunnah is not of me.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 5063, and Muslim, 1401)\n\nIf you do not want to get married because you have no sexual desire, or you think that you are not able to fulfil the duties of marriage, and you are afraid of falling short in meeting a wife`s needs, I say to you: In that case there is no sin on you if you do not get married, but do not rely on your thoughts and notions. Rather you should consult a specialist doctor and ask him for advice, for he is most able to diagnose your condition, and he may have some advice for treatment that has never crossed your mind. So do not hesitate to visit him and do not let shyness stop you, for matters of medical treatment are not the place for shyness.\xa0\nIf you say that you are afraid because you are poor and do not have enough wealth to look after a family, I say to you: Try your best to earn a living and be content and think positively of Allah, for He has promised on the lips of His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that He will help the one who wants to be chaste and seeks that which is halal by getting married.\xa0\n\nAbu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There are three whom Allah is bound to help: the Mujahid who strives (in Jihad) for the sake of Allah, the Mukatib (a slave who has made a contract of manumission with his master) who wants to pay off his manumission, and a man who gets married, seeking to remain chaste.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi (1655), classed as sound by Al-Albani in Saheeh At-Tirmidhi) \xa0\n\nIf you have something that you want to achieve – such as a certificate, a position, a project and so on – and you say that you want to achieve that first, then you will get married, we say to you: Why are you ignoring marriage for that reason?\xa0\n\nMarriage has never been a barrier to achieving things, rather in most cases it is a support and a help. That is just the whisperings of the satan, which he has instilled in the minds of many young men so that it has become prevalent in our culture and society, and you hear many of those who have delayed their own marriages or the marriages of their sons and daughters saying such things, and our society has become burdened with problems resulting from large numbers of single men and women, and the delay of marriage. However, despite that we have not seen any achievement, development or progress, whereas the first generation of Muslims used to hasten to do good and they did not delay marriage, and their achievements were the greatest and most complete of achievements.\xa0\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Majmu` Al-Fatawa (20/421):\xa0\n“What is required is to hasten to get married, and no young man or young woman should delay marriage for the sake of studies, because marriage does not prevent any such thing. It is possible for a young man to get married in order to protect his religious commitment and morals, and enable him to lower his gaze . Marriage serves many purposes, especially in this day and age. Because delaying it is harmful for both young women and young men, every young man and every young woman should hasten to get married if there is a man who is compatible with the woman, and if a man can find the right woman.”\n\nOver and above all that, how about if you realise that marriage will protect half of your religion?\xa0\n\nAnas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whomever Allah has blessed with a righteous wife, He has helped him with half of his religion, so let him fear Allah with regard to the other half.” (Narrated by Al-Hakim in Al-Mustadrak, 2/175), At-Tabarani in Al-Awsat, 1/294) and Al-Bayhaqi in Shu`ab Al-Iman, 4/382) Al-Hakim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “This is a Hadith with an authentic Isnad (chain of narrators), although they (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) did not narrate it.” Adh-Dhahabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in At-Talkhis: it is authentic. It was classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Targhib, 2/192)\n\nHow about if you realise that by getting married, you will have followed the advice of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when he said:\xa0 “O young men, whoever among you can afford it , let him get married, for it is more effective in lowering the gaze and guarding one`s chastity.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 5065, and Muslim, 1400)\nHow about if you realise that by producing a righteous child, you will have ongoing charity (Sadaqah Jariyah), if you raise him with good morals and upon faith, and you will be rewarded for your marriage if you seek reward with Allah for that .\xa0\nBy getting married, you will be protecting yourself, lowering your gaze , and closing the door to one of the greatest means by which the devil deceives people. You may not feel the seriousness of that now, but Fitnah (temptation) may come from places a person does not realise, so you should be keen to close the door before it is opened without you realising it.\n\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I have not left after me any Fitnah more harmful to men than women.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 5096, and Muslim, 2741).\n\nMarriage is a source of tranquillity and peace, and it is the best of the pleasures of this world. In it, is that which Allah has made a sign for His slaves, and He has mentioned it in His Book so that they may think and ponder the greatness of His Might, may He be glorified and exalted. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n\n“And among His Signs is this, that He created for you wives from among yourselves, that you may find repose in them, and He has put between you affection and mercy. Verily, in that are indeed signs for a people who reflect.” [Ar-Rum 30:21]\nCan there be any hesitation after this?\xa0\nBe resolved and put your trust in Allah, and Allah will help you, and will provide you with a righteous wife who will help you to obey your Lord and He will bless you with righteous offspring who will be a stored treasure for you with Allah in the Hereafter.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/82968/is-it-prohibited-in-islam-to-not-get-married
