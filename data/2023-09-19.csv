419460,"How can one beseech Allah, may He be glorified, and call upon Him by mentioning one’s vulnerable situation? Is it by telling Allah, may He be exalted, of my weakness and what is on my mind, like getting something off my chest, and is it permissible to do that in the prayer?","['Praise be to Allah.Tawassul or beseeching Allah, may be done by virtue of His names and attributes; or by virtue of one’s righteous deeds, such as the supplicant saying: “O Allah, I ask of You by virtue of the fact that You are Allah, there is no god worthy of worship except You, the One, the Eternal Refuge,” or, “O Allah, I ask You by virtue of Your knowledge and Your mercy,” or, “O Allah, I ask of You by virtue of my love for You and my love for Your Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).”\nThis tawassul is proven in the sahih Sunnah.\nSee the answers to questions no. 979 and 3297 .\nAnother type of tawassul that is prescribed is to beseech Allah by virtue of your need for Him, as Allah, may He be exalted, tells us that His Prophet Ayyub (peace be upon him) said (interpretation of the meaning): {Indeed, adversity has touched me, and you are the Most Merciful of the merciful} [al-Anbiya’ 21:83], or by virtue of your admitting your wrongdoing and your need for Allah, as He, may He be exalted, tells us that His Prophet Yunus (peace be upon him) said (interpretation of the meaning): {There is no god worthy of worship except You; exalted are You. Indeed, I have been of the wrongdoers} [Al-Anbiya’ 21:87].\nIf what is meant is beseeching Allah by virtue of your difficult situation, this is mentioning your need for Allah, and there is nothing wrong with that, because expressing your poverty, need and humility is one of the means of having your supplication answered, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {Call upon your Lord in humility and privately; indeed, He does not like transgressors} [Al-A‘raf 7:55].\nHumility means humbling oneself and submitting. See: Zad al-Masir (2/129).\nMentioning one’s difficult situation and vulnerability comes under the heading of complaining, and complaining to Allah is prescribed in Islamic teachings and is not contrary to patience. If it comes in the context of supplication, it is good because it is expressing vulnerability and humility.\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Complaining to Allah is not contrary to patience, as noted above regarding the complaint of Ya‘qub to Allah, even though he said (interpretation of the meaning): {so patience is most fitting} [Yusuf 12:18].\nAs for telling other people about one’s difficult situation, if that is for the purpose of seeking advice or help, or seeking assistance to remove the harm, that is not contrary to patience, such as a patient complaining to a doctor about his problem, or one who has been wronged telling someone who could help and support him, or one who is going through trials complaining to someone who he hopes could relieve him of his troubles. When the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) visited the sick person he would ask him about his condition and would say: How are you? He asked that in order to find out about him and how he was doing.""(‘Iddat as-Sabirin, p. 271).\nSo there is nothing wrong with a person complaining to his Lord, telling him about his situation and vulnerability and what he is feeling, then following that with expression of his humility and need by asking his Lord to relieve him of distress and meet his need. So telling Him about your difficult situation and vulnerability is a means of beseeching Him before offering supplication, whether that is done in the prayer or otherwise.\nThere is a hadith which mentions complaining about one’s situation by saying, “O Allah, to You I complain about my lack of strength, lack of resources and people’s careless attitude towards me…”, but its isnad is not sahih.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/419460/how-can-one-beseech-allah-by-mentioning-ones-vulnerable-situation
314410,What is the ruling on calling food (and things in general) by one of the names of Allah? “Haleem” is a kind of food that is popular in India and Pakistan.,"['Praise be to Allah.The names of Allah, may He be exalted, are of two types:\nThe first type is names that are exclusive to Him, may He be glorified, such as: Allah, ar-Rahman (the Most Gracious), ar-Rabb (the Lord), al-Ahad (the One), and so on. It is not permissible to call anything or anyone by these names, because that is like competing or disputing with Allah, may He be exalted, regarding something that is unique to Him alone.\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAmong the names that are not permissible to use for people are the names of the Lord, may He be blessed and exalted. Therefore it is not permissible for a person to be called al-Ahad (the One), as-Samad (the Eternal Refuge), al-Khaliq (the Creator), ar-Raziq (the Provider), or any of the other names which belong exclusively to the Lord, may He be blessed and exalted. And it is not permissible for kings to be called al-Qahir (the Subduer) or az-Zahir (the Prevailing), or to be called al-Jabbar (the Compeller), al-Mutakabbir (the Supreme), al-Awwal (the First), al-Akhir (the Last), al-Batin (the Most Near), ‘Allam al-Ghuyub (Knower of the unseen).""(Tuhfat al-Mawdud\xa0 p. 125).\nThe second type are names which are shared, so there is nothing wrong with calling people or things by them, such as Karim (noble or generous), Halim (or Haleem – forbearing)), Rahim (merciful), Hakim (wise), ‘Alim (knowing), and so on.\nAllah, may He be exalted, said regarding Ibrahim and his son Isma‘il (peace be upon them both) (interpretation and meaning):\n{So We gave him good tidings of a forbearing boy}\xa0[As-Saffat 37:101].\nThere were among the Companions some who had such names, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not change those names, such as ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib and Hakim ibn Hizam (may Allah be pleased with them both).\nIt says in the commentary on the book Asna al-‘Matalib Sharh Rawd at-Talib (4/243), which is a Shafa‘i book:\nIt is permissible to call people and things by names of Allah, may He be exalted, which are not unique to Him. As for those which are unique to Him, it is haram to do that. An-Nawawi stated that clearly in Sharh Muslim. End quote.\nBased on that, there is nothing wrong with calling some type of food “haleem”, because this is one of the names that are shared, and it is not a name that belongs exclusively to Allah, may He be exalted.\nMoreover, giving a name such as this to this type of food is like a metaphor, and there is no reason to think that it is sharing a name with Allah, may He be exalted.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/314410/is-it-permissible-to-call-something-haleem
