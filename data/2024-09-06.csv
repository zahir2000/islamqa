518455,"I market courses belonging to an educational company, without me paying any brokerage fee. The price of the course, for example, is $100, and my commission is known; it is $13 for every student I recruit for a specific period. This commission stays the same until I get ten students registering through me. After I get ten students, the commission increases to $17, even though the price of the course is still $100. The company does not use multilevel marketing (“pyramid scheme”). What is the ruling on this increase? Also, for example, if I get five students to register in one month, I will have a special prize from the company that was previously agreed upon, which is $50 that is in addition to the commission. What is the ruling on this prize or motivational gift?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThere is nothing wrong with marketing educational courses in return for a known commission, if the subject matter of the courses is permissible, because this is brokerage and a fee for something that is permissible.\nSecondly:\nFor the fee to be valid for providing a service, it must be known.\nIn Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah (15/216), it says:\nCharging a fee for providing a service, and what conditions are stipulated regarding that:\nIt must be known.\nThe Malikis, Shafa`is and Hanbalis said: In order for the service contract to be valid, it is stipulated that the fee must be wealth of a known type and amount, because if the fee is unknown, that undermines the purpose of the service contract, as hardly anyone would want to work when he does not know what he will get in return, let alone the fact that there is no reason not to know what fee is to be paid, in contrast to some tasks in which the effort required and who will do the work are both unknown\xa0 for a valid reason, in which case not knowing is forgivable.\nKnowing the fee is done by seeing it or by describing it. (End quote)\nIn Al-Ma`ayir Ash-Shar`iyyah (p. 261) it says: It is stipulated that the fee should be known and it should be of value according to Islamic teachings, and be something that can be delivered. If the fee is not known, or it is something that is not permissible according to Islamic teachings, or it cannot be delivered, then the current standard fee for such work should be given. (End quote)\nThere is nothing wrong with the fee varying according to the number of students, or according to the number who subscribe during a month, so long as it is known beforehand.\nThere is nothing wrong with what you mentioned about receiving $13 for each student, then if ten students registered through you, you will receive $17 for any other students who subscribe, because the fee is known.\nThere is also nothing wrong with agreeing that if five students register in one month, you will receive $50 in addition to the commission. All of that is permissible, because the condition is that the fee or commission should be known, and this condition is met in this case.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/518455/what-is-the-ruling-on-marketing-courses-in-return-for-commission-that-will-increase-when-the-number-of-students-increases
155691,I am a student in the faculty of sciences and I want to choose a specialty that will not conflict with Islam. What do you think of specialising in genetics? Is it permissible for me to choose this specialty?,"['Praise be to Allah.The Role of Science in Islam\nEvery branch of knowledge that people need in their religious or worldly affairs is not forbidden in and of itself with regard to studying, learning and understanding. But what is of concern is how this knowledge is used and applied.\xa0\nThere is nothing wrong with studying accountancy – for example – but the problem is with the practical application of it in the real life financial world, such as working in interest-based banks and other institutions.\xa0\nThe same may also be said concerning medicine. It is a branch of knowledge that is very important and people cannot do without it, but sometimes in real life it is used for things that are forbidden in Islam, such as cosmetic surgery for the purpose of beautification, abortions, and so on.\xa0\nIs It Permissible to Study Genetics in Islam?\nThe same may be said concerning the science of genetics, which is defined in Al-Mu`jam Al-Wasit (2/1024) as the science which examines the transmission of characteristics in living beings from one generation to another and explains the way this occurs.\xa0\nIt is an important branch of knowledge, one of the greatest benefits of which is knowledge of hereditary diseases and how to protect against them and treat them. It may also be used for beneficial purposes in plants and animals.\xa0\nBut at the same time there is room for those who are toying with what is called cloning. We have discussed a little about what is permitted and what is forbidden with regard to cloning and genetic engineering in the answers to questions no.\xa0103335 and\xa021582 .\xa0\nWhat matters then is not the theoretical study of genetics; rather it is the practical application thereof. Whatever is permissible and beneficial is encouraged by Islam, and whatever is prohibited and harmful, is forbidden by Islam.\xa0\nIslamic Guidelines on Genetic Research and Applications\nIn a conference of the Islamic Association of Medical Sciences in Kuwait, which was held under the heading, “Genetics, Genetic Engineering, the Human Genome and Gene Therapy: an Islamic View,” with the participation of the Islamic Fiqh Council in Jeddah, the Local Chapter of the World Health Organization in Alexandria, and the Islamic Organization for Education, Science and Culture, which was held during the period 23-25 Jumada Al-Akhirah 1419 AH/13-15 October 1998 CE, the following statement was issued:\xa0\nIslam is the religion of science and knowledge, as it says in the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {Say: ‘Are those who know equal to those who know not?’} [Az-Zumar 39:2]\nIslam does not hold the human mind back from beneficial scientific research, but it is not permissible for the results of this research to be put into practice until they have been measured against Islamic guidelines. Whatever is in accordance with Shari`ah is permitted, and whatever goes against it is not permitted. The science of genetics with its various aspects – as with all additions to knowledge – is something that Islam encourages and Muslim scientists should be in the forefront of it.\xa0(End quote)\xa0\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 111969 , 308325 , 119830 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/155691/is-it-permissible-to-study-genetics-in-islam
221997,"My mother got her period, then she became pure after seven days, as usual, then one week later, she got her period again. Is this regarded as menses? Should she pray and fast? Please note that she takes measures to prevent that and she is approximately forty-eight years old. Should she continue not to pray throughout the two periods, even if they add up to more than fifteen days?","['Praise be to Allah.The scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) differed regarding the minimum duration of the state of purity between two menses. We have stated previously that there is no minimum duration of the state of purity between two menses, so if a woman’s period comes to her after the previous period, then she is menstruating, whether the time between the two menses was long or short.\nPlease see the answers to questions no. 37828 and 20898 .\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAs for the minimum duration of the state of purity between two menses, it was said that the minimum is thirteen days, and it was said that there is no minimum, just as there is no maximum, and this view is the one that is correct.\nBased on this correct view, it is possible for a woman to menstruate twice in one month, but the woman should know that menstrual blood is what is menses, whereas the other kind of blood, which is thin and yellowish, is not menses; rather it is irregular bleeding (Istihadah). (End quote from Fatawa Nur `ala Ad-Darb by Ibn `Uthaymin).\nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 5595 .\nBased on that, with regard to what happened to your mother after one week, if its characteristics were those of menstrual blood, then it was menses.\nWith regard to the two menses lasting beyond fifteen days in the case of one who menstruates twice in a month, that does not matter. There are some women who menstruate for sixteen or seventeen days of every month, and that is their normal, regular pattern.\nIbn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: There is no minimum or maximum duration (for menses). Rather what a woman sees as her normal, regular pattern is menses. If it so happens that it lasts for less than a day and that is her regular pattern, then it is menses. If it so happens that it lasts for seventeen days and that is her regular pattern, then it is menses.\nBut if the bleeding is continuous, then it is known that this is not menses, because it is known from Islamic teachings and from linguistic usage that a woman is sometimes pure (not menstruating) and is sometimes menstruating, so there are rulings for her period of purity and there are rulings for her menses. (End quote from Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 19/237)\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhat is meant by “its maximum is fifteen days” is the maximum duration of menses. This is the view of the madhhab and they quoted as evidence what is typically the case; it is typically the case that a woman’s menses does not exceed fifteen days. Moreover, anything beyond this time would take up the greater part of the month, and it is not possible for the period of purity to be shorter than the duration of menses.\nSo if it is sixteen days, then the period of purity would be fourteen days, and it cannot be the case that the bleeding lasts for longer than the period of purity…\nHowever, the correct view is that there is no maximum duration of menses, because there are women for whom the regular pattern is seventeen days, or sixteen days. What is it that makes the blood before sunset on the fifteenth day menses and the blood one minute after sunset irregular bleeding (Istihadah), even though the nature, colour and abundance of the flow are the same? So how can it be said that within the space of one or two minutes the blood turns from menses to irregular bleeding with no evidence? If there was any evidence to support what they say, we would accept it.\nSo if the woman has a normal, regular pattern of seventeen days, for example, we say that it is all menses.\nBut if the bleeding continues for the entire month, or it stops briefly, such as for a day or two, or it is intermittent, so it comes for a few hours and stops for a few hours throughout the month, then this is irregular bleeding (Istihadah).\n(End quote from Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti`, 1/471-472).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/221997/she-got-her-period-twice-in-one-month-and-the-two-periods-together-added-up-to-more-than-fifteen-days
20803,What is the reward for becoming a Hafidh?,"['Praise be to Allah.The Elevated Status of Memorising the Quran in the Hereafter\nWhoever memorises the Quran and acts upon it, Allah will reward him and honour him greatly for that, so that he will rise in status in Paradise to a level commensurate with what he memorised of the Book of Allah.\nAt-Tirmidhi (2914) and Abu Dawud (1464) narrated from `Abdullah ibn `Amr that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “It will be said to the companion of the Quran: Recite and rise in status, recite as you used to recite in the world, for your status will be at the last verse that you recite.” This Hadith was classed as authentic by Al-Albani in As-Silsilah As-Sahihah, 5/218, no. 2240, after which he said:\xa0\nNote that what is meant by the “companion of the Quran” is the one who memorises it by heart , as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “The one who knows more Quran should lead the people in prayer,” meaning the one who has memorised the most.\xa0 The differentiation in status in Paradise will depend on how much was memorised in this world, not how much one will recite on that day as some people imagine. This clearly points to the virtue of the Hafdh who has memorised the Quran , but that is subject to the condition that he memorises it for the sake of Allah, not for worldly purposes or financial gain. Otherwise the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Most of the hypocrites of my Ummah are among those who have memorised the Quran.”\xa0\nThe Virtue of the Quran Memorizer\nConcerning the virtue of the Hafidh who memorises the Quran , Al-Bukhari (4937) narrated from `A’ishah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The likeness of the one who reads Quran and memorises it is that he is with the righteous honourable scribes. The likeness of the one who reads it and tries hard to memorise it even though it is difficult for him, he will have two rewards.”\xa0\nFor the Hafidh who has memorised the Quran , praying Qiyam Al-Layl is easy. And the Quran will intercede for him on the Day of Resurrection, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Fasting and the Quran will intercede for a person on the Day of Resurrection. Fasting will say, `O Lord, I deprived him of food and desires during the day, so let me intercede for him.’ The Quran will say, `O Lord I deprived him of his sleep at night, so let me intercede for him.’ Then they will both intercede for him.” (Narrated by Ahmad, At-Tabarani and Al-Hakim; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Al-Jami’, no. 3882)\xa0\nIt should be noted here that there is a weak Hadith that is quoted concerning the virtue of memorising the Quran. This Hadith says, “The bearer of the Quran, if he regards what it permits as permissible and what it forbids as forbidden, he will intercede for ten of his family members on the Day of Resurrection, all of whom deserved to enter Hell.” (Narrated by Al-Bayhaqi in Shu`ab Al-Iman (The Branches of Faith) from Jabir; it was classed as inauthentic by Al-Albani in Da`ief Al-Jami`)\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20803/reward-for-memorising-quran
