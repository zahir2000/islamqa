256475,"Sometimes only one doctor is on call, and he goes to offer his prayer, and whilst he is praying he is notified of an emergency case. Should he interrupt his prayer so that the patient will not be harmed because of his delay, or what should he do?","['Praise be to Allah.If the doctor has started to pray, then he is told of an emergency case and there is no one available to take care of it except him, then what he must do is interrupt his prayer and treat the patient, because the prayer may be repeated later, or even made up after its time has ended, whereas if the life of the patient is lost because of the doctor’s delay, he cannot be brought back.\nThe same applies if the patient suffers physical harm because of such a delay.\nOne of the well-established principles according to the scholars is that that which could be lost is to be given precedence over that which cannot be lost.\nIt says in Kashshaf al-Qina‘ (1/380): We should protect a disbeliever whose life is to be protected because he is living under Muslim rule, or there is a truce or treaty with his people, from falling into a well and the like, such as a snake that is heading towards him, just as we should protect a Muslim from that, because both lives are to be protected according to Islamic teachings.\nAnd we should save a drowning person and the like, such as one who is caught in a fire, so prayer should be interrupted for that purpose, whether the prayer is obligatory or supererogatory.\nWhat appears to be the case is that this applies even if there is not much time left for the prayer, because the individual can make up the prayer after the time for it has ended, unlike saving the one who is drowning and the like. End quote.\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Interrupting the prayer for an important reason, or to ward off danger, such as saving one who is caught in a fire or is drowning, or warding off a human or animal who wants to kill him, and the like – there is nothing wrong with any of that.""(Fatawa Nur ‘ala ad-Darb by Ibn Baz 9/303).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: He may interrupt his prayer to save one whose life is to be protected [according to Islamic teachings], because saving one whose life is to be protected is obligatory, and doing that will be missed if he continues praying. As for prayer, continuing it is obligatory, but he can make it up after saving that person whose life is to be protected.""(Fatawa Nur ‘ala ad-Darb by Ibn ‘Uthaymin).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/256475/can-the-on-call-doctor-interrupt-his-prayer-if-an-emergency-case-is-brought-to-the-hospital
342396,"Some people say [in Arabic] “May the angels of the Most Gracious say Bismillah over you” in response to someone saying “Bismillah ‘alayk” [lit. “In the name of Allah over you”, meant as a prayer for Allah’s protection]. Can we attribute this action [saying Bismillah] to the angels? What is the ruling on that? What should a person do who has the habit of saying this to people? Is it a sin?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe angels\nThe angels are honoured slaves of Allah who have the characteristics that Allah has mentioned in His book (interpretation of the meaning):\n{[All] praise is [due] to Allah, Creator of the heavens and the earth, [who] made the angels messengers having wings, two or three or four. He increases in creation what He wills. Indeed, Allah is over all things competent}\xa0[Fatir 35:1]\n{The heavens almost break from above them, and the angels exalt [ Allah ] with praise of their Lord and ask forgiveness for those on earth. Unquestionably, it is Allah who is the Forgiving, the Merciful}\xa0[ash-Shura 42:5].\nSecondly:\nWas it narrated that the angels say Bismillah over anyone?\nThere is no report in the Islamic texts to suggest that the angels say Bismillah over anyone; rather it was narrated that they pray for forgiveness for the believer . So if someone says: “May the angels pray for forgiveness for you,” and the like, that is more appropriate and is better.\nBut we say: there is nothing wrong with such phrases that are commonly used by people, because saying Bismillah is no more than a kind of dhikr (remembrance of Allah), and the intended meaning is: May Allah protect you; or it is a supplication asking Allah to protect and take care of the other person. There is nothing wrong with any of that. The angels glorify and remember Allah, and among the angels are guardians and protectors who protect people by Allah’s command and decree, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{For each one are successive [angels] before and behind him who protect him by the decree of Allah. Indeed, Allah will not change the condition of a people until they change what is in themselves. And when Allah intends for a people ill, there is no repelling it. And there is not for them besides Him any patron}\xa0[Ar-Ra‘d 13:11].\nIn other words, Allah has angels who come in succession to protect His slave from all directions, coming one after another without any delay. Each of them comes straight after the other, taking turns to protect him by night and by day from all harm that could touch him or anything bad that could happen to him. This protection is by the command of Allah, meaning because Allah has commanded them to do that. And when the decree of Allah [for some harm to befall him] comes to pass, the angels forsake him.""(At-Tafsir al-Wasit\xa0 5/416).\nMoreover, if someone were to say: “May the angels of the Most Gracious say Bismillah over you,” he is not saying that this is what the angels do; rather it is a supplication asking that the angels might say Bismillah over him, and is a prayer for protection for him, asking that the blessing of Allah’s name be bestowed upon him. This is clearly a good intention, and there is nothing wrong with it, in sha Allah.\nConclusion:\nThere does not seem to be anything wrong with this phrase, and there is nothing to dictate that one should be strict about it or tell off anyone who says it.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/342396/what-is-the-ruling-on-saying-may-the-angels-of-the-most-gracious-say-bismillah-over-you
