182716,"I want to commit suicide, not because I hate this world, but because I long to meet Allah! I cannot wait any longer, even if that means going for jihad. I want to see Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, may His name be honoured and may His attributes be sanctified. Will I go to hell if I commit suicide with the intention of seeing Allah?","['Praise be to Allah.Committing suicide is a major sin, and there is no such thing in Islam as committing suicide with the intention of seeing Allah or drawing close to Him. How can a person draw close to his Lord by doing something that He has forbidden him to do, warned him against it and threatened him with a grievous and painful punishment if he does it?\nIf that were prescribed, then the most beloved of all people to Allah and those with the greatest longing to meet Him, namely the prophets and the righteous, would have done it. So ignore the whispers and intrusive thoughts prompted by the Shaytan and beware of falling into this grievous sin which could deprive you of seeing Allah in the hereafter and take you to the fire of hell, to abide therein forever.\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) stated that the one who commits suicide will be punished on the Day of Resurrection with something like that with which he killed himself.\nIt was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever throws himself down from a mountain and kills himself will be throwing himself down in the Fire of Hell for ever and ever. Whoever drinks poison and kills himself will be sipping it in the in the Fire of Hell for ever and ever. Whoever kills himself with a piece of iron will have that iron in his hand, thrusting it into his belly in the Fire of Hell for ever and ever.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (5442) and Muslim (109).\nIt was narrated from Thabit ibn ad-Dahhak (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever kills himself with something in this world will be punished with it on the Day of Resurrection.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (5700) and Muslim (110).\nIt was narrated that Jundub ibn ‘Abdillah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “A man among those who came before you was wounded. He panicked and took a knife and cut his hand, and the bleeding did not stop until he died. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, said: ‘My slave hastened his death; I have forbidden Paradise to him.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (3276) and Muslim (113).\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) refrained from offering the funeral prayer for one who had committed suicide, as a punishment to him and so as to deter others from doing what he had done. It was narrated that Jaabir ibn Samurah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: A man who had killed himself with a broad arrow-head was brought to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and he did not offer the funeral prayer for him. Narrated by Muslim (978).\nThis hadith is evidence for those who say that the funeral prayer should not be offered for one who killed himself, because of his sin. This is the view of ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Aziz and al-Awza‘i. But al-Hasan, al-Nakha‘i, Qatadah, Malik, Abu Hanifah, ash-Shafa‘i and the majority of scholars said that the funeral prayer should be offered for him. They responded to this hadith by pointing out that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not offer the funeral prayer for him himself, so as to deter the people from doing something similar, but the Sahabah offered the funeral prayer for him.""(Sharh Muslim\xa07/47).\nDrawing close to Allah, may He be exalted, is to be done by means of what He has prescribed; the best of that is doing obligatory duties, then doing supererogatory acts, as mentioned in the hadith narrated by al-Bukhari (6502) from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah says: ‘Whoever takes a close friend of Mine as an enemy, I declare war on him. My slave does not draw closer to Me by anything more beloved to Me than that which I have made obligatory upon him, and My slave continues to draw closer to Me by doing nafl (supererogatory) deeds until I love him, and if I love him, I will be his hearing with which he hears, his vision with which he sees, his hand with which he strikes and his foot with which he walks. If he were to ask of Me, I would surely give to him; if he were to seek refuge with Me, I would surely grant him refuge.”\nWe ask Allah to guide and help you, and to protect you from the evil of your own self and the whispers of the Shaytan.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/182716/he-wants-to-commit-suicide-out-of-haste-and-longing-to-meet-allah
222836,"I want to go – if Allah, may He be Exalted, wills – on the seventh day of Dhul-Hijjah to perform Hajj tamattu` [i.e., `Umrah followed by Hajj, exiting Ihram in between]. What should I say when I begin the rituals? Which is better, to shave the head or cut the hair after doing the sa`i of `Umrah? From where should I enter Ihram for Hajj? Do I have to shave my head on the Day of Sacrifice, after stoning Jamrat Al-`Aqabah?","['Praise be to Allah.What is Hajj Tamattu`?\nHajj Tamattu` means entering Ihram for `Umrah only during the months of Hajj – the months of Hajj are Shawwal, Dhul-Qa`dah and Dhul-Hijjah – so when entering Ihram for it, one should say: “Labbayk `umratan (Here I am in response to your call, I perform `Umrah).”\xa0\nStep-by-Step Guide for Hajj Tamattu`\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said, describing `Umrah of Tammatu`:\xa0\n“When the pilgrim reaches the Miqat, he should do Ghusl as in the case of major impurity, and apply the best perfume he can find to his head and beard, then put on the Ihram garments, an Izar (lower garment) and Rida’ (upper garment). It is preferable for them to be white and clean.\nThen he should say: “Labbayk `umratan (Here I am in response to your call, I perform`Umrah).” There is no need for him to say that he is connecting it to Hajj, exiting Ihram in between, because he has already formed the intention in his heart that he is going to perform Hajj. So he should say: “Labbayk `umratan, Labbayka Allahumma labbayk , labbayka la sharika laka labbayk. Inna Al-hamd wan-ni`mata laka wal Mulk, la sharika lak\xa0 (Here I am in response to your call, I perform`Umrah. Here I am, O Allah, here I am. Here I am, You have no partner, here I am. Verily all praise and blessings are Yours, and all sovereignty, You have no partner).”\xa0\nMen should raise their voices when saying this, and it should be understood that no tree, rock or brick hears him but it will testify on the Day of Resurrection that he said this Talbiyah.\xa0\nWhat the Talbiyah means is responding to Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, because the word “labbayk” means: I am responding to You.\xa0\nHe should continue reciting the Talbiyah until he begins the Tawaf of `Umrah. When he reaches Makkah, he should do Tawaf and Sa`i for `Umrah , shave or cut his hair, and exit his Ihram. Then on the day of At-Tarwiyah, which is the eighth day of Dhul-Hijjah, he should enter Ihram for Hajj only and do all the actions of Hajj. So the one who does tamattu` does a complete `Umrah and a complete Hajj.” (Al-Liqa’ Ash-Shahri)\nWhen to Enter Ihram for Hajj Tamattu`\nThe one who is doing Hajj Tamattu` enters Ihram on the eighth day of Dhul-Hijjah from the place where he is staying. When he enters Ihram for Hajj, he does the same as he did when he entered Ihram for `Umrah, doing Ghusl and putting on perfume. So he should form the intention to enter Ihram for Hajj and say “Labbayka Hajjan (here I am in response to your call, I performHajj)”, then recite the well-known Talbiyah.\xa0\nThe scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas said:\xa0\n“With regard to the one who enters Ihram for `Umrah from the Miqat, intending to follow it with Hajj Tamattu`, when he has done `Umrah he should exit Ihram. There is nothing wrong with him going to Jeddah or elsewhere, then entering Ihram for Hajj from the place where he is staying after doing `Umrah.” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, vol. 2, 10/76-77)\xa0\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“What is prescribed for the pilgrim who is not in Ihram is to enter Ihram on the day of at-Tarwiyah from the place where he is, whether he is inside Makkah or outside, or in Mina, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed those who had exited Ihram after `Umrah to enter Ihram for Hajj on the day of At-Tarwiyah from the places where they were staying.” (Majmu` Fatawa Ibn Baz, 16/140)\nInstructions for Hajj Tamattu` Pilgrims\nAs you are going to do `Umrah on the seventh day (of Dhul-Hijjah), you should cut your hair after finishing `Umrah, and not shave your head, so that some of your hair will remain for you to shave it off during Hajj. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed his companions, during the Farewell Pilgrimage, to cut their hair following `Umrah, because their arrival was on the morning of the fourth day of Dhul-Hijjah. This indicates that cutting the hair in this situation is preferable to shaving, and it is better so that the head can be shaved during Hajj.\xa0\nWhat pilgrims do on the Day of Sacrifice\xa0\nThe actions on the Day of Sacrifice, for the pilgrim who is doing Tamattu` are, in order: stoning Jamrat Al-`Aqabah, offering the sacrifice, shaving the head or cutting the hair, Tawaf Al-Ifadah and Sa`i. This is the best way, because this is what the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did. For more information, please see the answer to question no.\xa0106594 \xa0\nIf the pilgrim does some of them earlier and others later, or he does some of them after the Day of Sacrifice, there is nothing wrong with that.\xa0\nThe scholars unanimously agree that it is permissible to delay shaving the head until the last of the days of At-Tashriq , but if the pilgrim delays it any longer than that, then he must offer a compensatory sacrifice, according to some scholars. (See Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah, 10/12-13)\xa0\nTry to do your Hajj with one of the scholars or seekers of knowledge, so that you can ask him whatever you need to know about Hajj and `Umrah.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/222836/when-to-enter-ihram-for-hajj-tamattu
153386,"A friend of mine was offering 2 Rak`ahs sunnah after Maghrib in the Mosque, when a new comer joined him for Jamah. My friend didn't know what to do as he was offering the Sunnah and he knew that the new comer was under the impression that he was offering fard. After the prayer my friend was still in the Mosque when the new comer finished his prayer and asked my friend why he had not been reading out loud as it was MAghrib. My friend informed him that he had been reading the Sunnah and therefore could not have read out loud. Could you please clarify with daleel [proof from Hadith/Sunnah] as to what should be done in such a situation where you are offering a Sunnah prayer and someone joins you thinking its Fard?","['Praise be to Allah.Offering obligatory prayer behind sunnah prayer\xa0\nThere is nothing wrong with one who is offering an obligatory prayer to pray behind one who is offering an optional prayer . It is proven that Mu`adh ibn Jabal (may Allah be pleased with him) used to pray `Isha’ with the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), then he would go back to his people and lead them in praying ‘Isha’, and the prayer was optional for him and obligatory for them.\xa0\nIt was narrated that Jabir ibn `Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Mu`adh ibn Jabal (may Allah be pleased with him) used to pray with the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), then he would go to his people and lead them in prayer. And he would recite Al-Baqarah. … The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Recite ‘By the sun and its brightness’ [Ash-Shams 91:1], and ‘Glorify the Name of your Lord, the Most High’ [Al-A’la 87:1] and the like.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 5755 and Muslim, 465)\xa0\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“In this Hadith, we see that it is permissible for one who is offering an obligatory prayer to pray behind one who is offering a optional prayer , because Mu‘adh used to offer the obligatory prayer with the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), so he discharged his duty, then he would pray the second time with his people, so it was voluntary for him and obligatory for them. This is stated clearly elsewhere than in Muslim, and this is permissible according to Ash-Shafa‘i (may Allah have mercy on him) and others.” (Sharh Muslim, 4/181)\nChanging intention of prayer after starting it\nThere is nothing wrong with a person starting his prayer alone and then becoming an Imam when someone else joins him.\xa0\nIbn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I stayed overnight with my maternal aunt. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) got up to pray at night and I got up to pray with him. I stood on his left and he took hold of my head and made me stand on his right.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 667 and Muslim, 763)\xa0\nImam Al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) included this report in a chapter entitled: If the imam did not intend to lead others in prayer, then people join him so he leads them in prayer.\xa0\nAnas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was praying in Ramadan, and I came and stood beside him, and another man came and stood too, until there was a group of us. When the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) realized that I was behind him, he made his prayer brief. (Narrated by Muslim, 1104)\xa0\nSome of the scholars said that it is permissible to do this in optional prayers, but not in obligatory prayers. But the correct view is that it is valid in both cases.\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“The correct view is that that is permissible in both obligatory and optional prayers.” (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 22/258)\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“But the correct view is that it is valid in both obligatory and optional prayers . With regard to optional prayers , it is mentioned in the text; with regard to obligatory prayers, what is proven in the case of optional prayers is also proven with regard to obligatory prayers, unless there is evidence to the contrary.” (Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti`, 2/304)\xa0\nIf you are joined by other people in sunnah prayer, should you recite out loud or quietly?\nIf a person starts to pray behind a man who has started to offer an optional prayer , as in the case asked about here, then the imam has the choice as to whether he recites out loud or quietly .

436389,"If someone is travelling at the time of Eid al-Adha, so he asks someone else to pay money for the udhiyah to one of the charities that do udhiyah on behalf of people, but he does not mention a particular charity, so the other person chooses one of the charities and pays the price of the udhiyah,  but they do not ask him the name of the donor, so the charity takes the price of the udhiyah without the donor’s name, and the proxy thinks that it is not necessary to mention the name of the donor of the udhiyah – is it essential to mention the name of the donor? If it is essential to mention the name of the donor, does the other person who chose the charity and paid on behalf of the donor have to do anything, or is he liable?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly: There is nothing wrong with giving a charity money to do the udhiyah; this comes under the heading of delegating them as a proxy to slaughter the udhiyah.\nCharities undertake to do that in two ways:\nThe first way is mentioning the donors by name, so they have a list of their names and a sheep will be slaughtered on behalf of So-and-so son of So-and-so, and a cow will be slaughtered on behalf of seven specific people who are named in the list, and they do that for each cow. This is what is obligatory.\nThe second way is not mentioning the donors by name; rather if they have one hundred people, for example, they will slaughter one hundred sheep on their behalf, without stating that this sheep is on behalf of So-and-so, and this one is on behalf of So-and-so. This is not valid.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Some Hajj groups collect money from the pilgrims to offer the hadiy (sacrifice) on their behalf, but they do not mention the name of each person [at the time of slaughter]. Is this permissible?\nHe replied: This is not permissible. It is essential to name the person on whose behalf the sacrifice is being slaughtered. So for example, if there are thirty men in the group, and they bought thirty sheep for them, then he [the slaughterman] should have on hand a list of their names, and every time he slaughters a sheep, he should say: This is on behalf of So-and-so. It is essential to mention the names. As for slaughtering thirty sheep on behalf of thirty men, that is not right.""(Al-Liqa’ ash-Shahri\xa0 73/32).\nAnd he (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: We have heard from you that you warned against giving money to these companies, but what is the solution\xa0 regarding what is past? We did Hajj more than once, and we gave money to these companies, but they did not take our names. What is the ruling on what is past? Is it valid? If it is not valid, then what must we do?\nAnswer: We did not warn against giving the hadiy, because the hadiy (sacrifice) is in fact necessary. The person has two options: either he can give it to these companies (charities), or he can slaughter it himself and leave it in the place where he slaughters it, and no one will benefit from it, neither he himself nor anyone else.\nBut if it so happens that a person slaughters his sacrifice, eats some of it and gives some of it as gifts and as charity, then undoubtedly this is much better. This is something that some people can do who have acquaintances in Makkah; they can appoint a proxy to do it on their behalf, and they can say: Slaughter the sacrifice on our behalf. In that case, it will be made use of. Or he can go to Makkah himself, and go to the slaughterhouse, and buy an animal and slaughter it there, and he will find people crowding around him to take some of the meat from him.\nBut what I think is that it is a grievous mistake to send the value of the udhiyah to another country, so that it may be slaughtered there. This is the thing for which there is no basis.\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to send the hadiy to Makkah to be slaughtered in Makkah, and there is no report from him, and no hadith, sound or weak, to suggest that he would send his udhiyah to any other place. Rather he would slaughter it in his own house, and they [his family] would eat some of it, give some of it as gifts and give some of it as charity.""(Al-Liqa’ ash-Shahri\xa0 34/17).\nBased on that, if the charity did not record your friend’s name, this means that they did not specify that this slaughter was done on his behalf. Rather they did it as we mentioned in the second scenario, in which they slaughter a number of animals on behalf of a number of people without mentioning them by name, and this is not permissible.\nPlease see the answer to question no. 126662 .\nSecondly:\nIf the donor was not mentioned by name, then no one is liable – with regard to what has happened in the past – and we ask Allah to accept the udhiyah from the donors. But he should not do that again with the udhiyah in the future.\nWe asked our shaykh, ‘Abd ar-Rahman al-Barrak (may Allah preserve him) about what should be done in a case when the udhiyah was not done in the name of a specific person, and who is responsible in the case when the number of animals slaughtered is fewer than the number required?\nHe said: It is obligatory to mention names.\nBut if names are not mentioned, we do not say that it is just regular meat; rather it is something that Allah has enjoined and He will reward the donor for it.\nIn the case of any shortfall in the numbers of sheep, or if some of the sheep die, the one who neglected to mention the names of the donors is the one who must bear responsibility.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/436389/what-is-the-ruling-on-charities-slaughtering-udhiyah-sacrifices-without-mentioning-the-donors-by-name-at-the-time-of-slaughter

Abu Bakr said: That which floats is permissible. Ibn `Abbas said: Its “food” is its “dead meat” (that which dies without being slaughtered in the prescribed manner), except that which has started to rot. Shurayh, the companion of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: Everything in the sea is (regarded as if it was) slaughtered in the prescribed manner.”\xa0\nAnd the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said concerning the sea: “Its water is a means of purification and its ‘dead meat’ is permissible.” (Narrated and classed as authentic by At-Tirmidhi, 69.

Moreover, there cannot be any such limit if we examine the texts. The texts say that pigs, any wild animal that has fangs, any bird that has talons, tame donkeys and scavengers are all prohibited.\xa0\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed that five animals are to be killed , namely: crows, kites, rats, scorpions and vicious dogs.\nFor more details, please refer to the following answers: 231261 , 2841 , 85534 , and 70320 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/126343/is-eating-testicles-permissible
