462582,Is it permissible to have the dua when entering toilet on a paper on the door of the bathroom?,"['Praise be to Allah.It is permissible to hang up adhkar for the purpose of reminding, but they should be hung up in appropriate places, so as to protect them from being mishandled or disrespected. So, for example, the dhikr for entering the lavatory should not be placed on the door of the bathroom; rather it should be placed beside the door on the outside, to the right or left of the entrance.\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\nIs it appropriate to put verses or adhkar of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on the walls in rooms for the purpose of reminding people of Allah, may He be exalted, and looking at them? Please advise us, may Allah reward you with good.\nHe replied:\nThe correct view is that there is nothing wrong with that, if it is for the purpose of reminding. There is nothing wrong with putting verses on the walls, or hadiths, for the purpose of reminding or benefitting others, such as hadiths about greeting with salaam or supplications (du‘a’s), or hadiths that remind people of what Allah has forbidden, or that encourage them to obey Allah, or Quranic verses. There is nothing wrong with putting such things on the walls in sitting rooms or offices. End quote from the shaykh’s website.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: As for writing hadiths [and hanging them up] at home, there is nothing wrong with writing a hadith in which there is some benefit, such as the expiation when leaving a gathering: “Subhanak Allahumma Rabbana wa bi hamdik, ashhadu an la ilaha illa anta, astaghfiruka wa atubu ilayk (Glory and praise be to You, O Allah our Lord. I bear witness that there is no god worthy of worship except You; I seek Your forgiveness and I repent to You).” In this there is a reminder.""(Liqa’ al-Bab al-Maftuh\xa0 197/13).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/462582/what-is-the-ruling-on-writing-adhkar-in-frames-and-hanging-them-up-for-the-purpose-of-reminding
8003,"I am usually out at school most of the day and I have to use the bathroom, I can't just go home to make Istinja’. Should I make Wudu and pray or should I miss the prayer and make it up later?","['Praise be to Allah.When a person relieves himself, he must cleanse himself of impurities either with water – which is best and most perfect – or with something other than water which will remove the impurities, such as toilet paper, fabric, stones or something else.\xa0\nIn Islam, How Does One Clean Himself After Using The Toilet?\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\nWhen a person relieves himself, he must do one of the following three things:\xa0\n\nPurify himself with water: This is permissible and the evidence for it is the\xa0Hadith of Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to relieve himself , then another boy and I would bring a vessel of water and a short spear [to use as a Sutrah for the prayer he was going to do after doing Wudu] and he would cleanse himself with the water.”\xa0 (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 149; Muslim, 271)\xa0\n\nThe reason for this is that the basic way of removing impurities is to use water. Just as you use water to remove any impurities from your foot, so too you use it to remove any impurities resulting from relieving yourself. \xa0\n\nPurify himself using stones: Doing Istijmar (using stones to cleanse oneself after relieving oneself) is sufficient. This is indicated by the words and actions of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). With regard to his words, Salman (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade us to use less than three stones for the purpose of Istijmar.”\xa0(Narrated by Muslim,\xa0 262)\xa0\n\nWith regard to his actions, Ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) went out to answer the call of nature and asked me to bring him three stones. I found two stones and searched for a third but could not find one. So I took a piece of dried dung and brought it to him. He took the two stones and threw away the dung and said, ‘This is a filthy thing.’”\xa0(Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 122)\xa0\nThe Hadith of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), which states that he gathered some stones for the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and brought them to him in his garment, put them down next to him, and then went away (narrated by Al-Bukhari, 154) indicates that Istijmar is permissible.\n\nPurify himself with stones then with water: I do not know of any report to this effect from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), but there is no doubt that this is more effective in cleaning.” (Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti’, 1/103-105)\xa0\n\nCan you miss prayer or delay it if you are unable to do Istinja’?\nBased on the above, you have no excuse for not praying or for delaying the prayer beyond the appointed time because you are unable to do Istinja’ (wash with water after relieving yourself), since you can remove the impurity and cleanse yourself of it using tissues and the like.\xa0\nEveryone can carry some tissues with him in his pocket to clean himself with. Moreover, it is not clear from the question what is stopping you from cleaning yourself with water after relieving yourself, especially since you say, “Should I make Wudu and pray or miss the prayer?”\xa0 What that means is that water is available, so you can bring some water to the toilet and use it to clean yourself. If you do not do that then you have to remove the impurity using tissues and the like, do Wudu, and then pray. It is not permissible for you to delay the prayer until its time has passed.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/8003/how-does-a-muslim-clean-himself-after-using-the-toilet
394904,"The wife left and went to her family’s house without the consent of her husband. After going through khul‘ and separation, she wants to spend the ‘iddah period following divorce in her husband’s house. Is it permissible for the husband to not allow her to spend the ‘iddah period in his house, or will he be sinning? Please note that she has moved all her belongings to her family’s house, and she wants to do that in order to make life difficult for the second wife and her ex-husband.","['Praise be to Allah.If khul‘ or divorce (talaq) in return for compensation has been completed, then the woman is divorced completely from her husband and her divorce comes under the heading of baynunah sughra; she has become a stranger to him, so it is not permissible for him to be alone with her, and she is not obliged to observe ‘iddah in his house, and he is not obliged to let her stay. But if they agree that she can observe ‘iddah in his house, there must be someone else there so that they will not be alone together, and she must cover in front of her ex-husband.\nIt says in al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (25/117): If the ex-husband’s house is spacious enough for both of them, and she can live in a separate room with a lockable door (and with all necessary facilities), whilst the ex-husband lives in the rest of the house, it is permissible. If there is no lockable door between them, but she has a mahram with her who can protect her from being alone with him, it is permissible. Otherwise, it is not permissible.

She does not have to observe ‘iddah in his house, because Fatimah bint Qays narrated that Abu Amr ibn Hafs divorced her completely whilst he was absent, and he sent something to her but she did not like it, so he [‘Amr’s envoy] said: By Allah, you are not entitled to anything from us. She came to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and told him about that, and he said: “You are not entitled to maintenance or accommodation from him.” He told her to observe ‘iddah in the house of Umm Sharik, then he said: “She is a woman whom my companions visit; observe ‘iddah in the house of Ibn Umm Maktum.” Agreed upon.""(Kashshaf al-Qina‘\xa0 5/434).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If he has issued a third divorce (talaq), and there is someone else in the house so that she will not be alone with the husband who divorced her, then there is nothing wrong with her remaining in the house, but she may move to her family’s house. But if there is no one in the house except the man who divorced her for a third time, then she must leave, because she is completely divorced from him and is no longer permissible for him. Based on that, it is not permissible for him to be alone with her. Therefore she must leave and go to her family’s house.""(Fatawa Nur ‘ala al-Darb).\nBased on that, you do not have to let her observe her ‘iddah in your house, because she is not entitled to accommodation.\nIn the case of one who is revocably divorced (first or second talaq), she should observe ‘iddah in the marital home, and it is not permissible to make her leave.\nIt says in Sharh Muntaha al-Iradat (3/206): The revocably divorced woman should stay in the house of her husband, but not in the case of mourning, such as the one whose husband has died. This was stated by Imam Ahmad. That is because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Do not turn them out of their [husbands’] houses, nor should they [themselves] leave [during that period]}\xa0[Al-Talaq 65:1].\nIt makes no difference whether the husband gave her permission to leave or not, because it is one of her rights during the ‘iddah, and it is a right ordained by Allah, may He be exalted.

152261,"Is it permissible to go fishing as a sport, knowing that we will not waste or mess about with the fish; rather we will eat it?","['Praise be to Allah.Is fishing prohibited?\nThe basic ruling with regard to hunting [translator’s note: in Arabic the same word is used to refer to hunting or fishing] is that it is permissible, except for one who is in a state of Ihram (for Hajj or `Umrah) or one who is in the Haram zone (the boundaries of the Makkan Sanctuary). This applies to hunting on land; with regard to fishing and the pursuit of other aquatic creatures, it is not prohibited for the one who is in Ihram. Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Lawful to you is what you catch from the sea and its use for food - for the benefit of yourselves and those who travel, but forbidden is what you catch on land as long as you are in a state of Ihram (for Hajj or Umrah). And fear Allah to Whom you shall be gathered back.”\xa0[Al-Ma’idah 5:96]\nIf a person hunts permissible animals with a permissible intention, such as earning a living by selling them or eating them, there is nothing wrong with hunting or catching them, according to scholarly consensus.\xa0\nSimilarly, if a person’s main aim, when catching fish, is permissible in principle, such as leisure and the like, but he will make use of what he catches, such as selling it or eating it, and so on, then there is nothing wrong with him doing such things.\xa0\nIs fishing prohibited as a sport?\nIf the hunter or fisherman does not have any particular need for what he catches, and he is only doing it for sport (as a leisure activity or for fun), then the ruling on hunting or fishing in this case changes from permissible to disliked.\xa0\nIt says in Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah (28/115):\xa0\n“If it is known that the basic principle with regard to hunting (or fishing) is that it is permissible, it cannot be deemed to be otherwise, or to be deemed disliked, prohibited or recommended or obligatory except in specific cases for which there is specific evidence, as follows:\xa0\n… Hunting or fishing is disliked if the purpose behind it is to have fun or do it as a leisure activity, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not take any living being as a target.”\xa0(Narrated by Muslim, 1957).”\xa0\nMore than one of the scholars have stated that hunting and fishing in this case is disliked.\xa0\nAl-Nafrawi Al-Maliki (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Hunting for fun is disliked.” (Al-Fawakih Ad-Dawani, 1/390)\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Hunting to meet a need is permissible; as for hunting for no purpose other than leisure or sport, it is disliked, and if it involves wronging people by transgressing upon their crops or property, then it is prohibited.”(Al-Fatawa Al-Kubra, 5/550)\nShaykh Mansur Al-Buhuti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“It is disliked to hunt for sport, because that is an idle pursuit. If the hunting involves wronging people by transgressing upon their crops or property, then it is prohibited, because the means take the same ruling as the ends.” (Kashshaf Al-Qina`, 6/213)\nIbn `Abidin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“In Majma‘ Al-Fatawa it says: (Hunting) is disliked if it is for leisure.” (Radd Al-Muhtar, 5/297)\nIs it permissible to fish as a sport if one will benefit from it?\nIf the purpose of the hunting or fishing is leisure and sport, but the person will benefit from it, by either eating, selling or giving away his catch as a gift and the like, then it no longer comes under the ruling of being disliked, as mentioned here, and the hunting or fishing reverts to the original ruling of permissibility, because in this case it is not purely for the purpose of sport and it does not involve damage to property\xa0 or tormenting the animals caught.\xa0\nShaykh Muhammad ibn Ibrahim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“It is not prescribed to cause death to a living being for sport, such as hunters shooting from moving vehicles, when the intention is not to eat it or feed it to others. In the Hadith it says: “Whoever kills a sparrow unlawfully will be questioned about it.” ( Fatawa wa Rasa’il Muhammad ibn Ibrahim Aal Ash-Shaykh, 12/231)\xa0\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“If it is for an Islamically-acceptable purpose, such as eating or selling it, as in the case of those who catch bustards, lizards and rabbits, and other permissible animals, to eat them or sell them, then there is nothing wrong with it. However, if a person is hunting or fishing in order to kill the animal and leave it there, this is not right. The least that can be said about it is that it is very disliked. No one should hunt an animal that can be eaten unless it is for a purpose, either to eat it or feed it to the poor or give it as a gift or sell it. As for hunting it for sport, that is not permissible; it is a kind of leisure or “fun” that is not appropriate on the part of the believer. It was narrated that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade hunting, except for food or to make use of (the animal caught).” (From the\xa0website of Shaykh Ibn Baz)\nTo sum up, hunting or fishing, as mentioned in the question, is permissible and there is nothing wrong with it, so long as it is possible to make use of what is caught, by eating it, selling it and so on.\xa0\nFor more details, please see this category: Rulings on sport, leisure and entertainment\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/152261/is-fishing-prohibited-in-islam
