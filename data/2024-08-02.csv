483121,"I prayed opposite to the direction of the qiblah without making the effort to work it out for more than a month, because I moved to a new apartment where I thought that the qiblah was in the same place. Should I repeat all the prayers? Can I pray them all at one time?","['Praise be to Allah.The worshipper should face towards the direction that he is certain is the qiblah, if he knows it. If he does not know the direction for sure, then he should make the effort to work it out, so that he will be praying in the direction that he thinks is most likely to be the qiblah.\nIf someone prays when he is unsure of the direction of the qiblah, and he is able to make the effort to work it out, then he is falling short and he must repeat the prayer.\nIbn ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe scholars are agreed that if someone prays not facing towards the qiblah and without making the effort to work it out, his prayer is not valid and he must repeat it facing towards the qiblah. This is similar to the case if he prayed without purifying himself.\nA similar ruling applies to the one who prays in a mosque where he can easily work out the qiblah from the mihrab and the like, but he does not do that, and prays facing a different direction.""(At-Tamheed\xa0 10/426).\nBut if he put effort into trying to work it out and got it wrong, then his prayer is valid and he does not have to repeat it.\nIbn ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nExamining this issue leads us to conclude that the individual does not have to repeat the prayer that he offered facing what he thought was the direction of the qiblah after making the effort to work it out, because its direction was not clear. That is because he has done what he was commanded to do and he has done what was required of him of making the effort to seek indications of the qiblah, then he thought that he was facing the right direction, then after he had prayed he realized that he had made a mistake.\nThe scholars are agreed that in this case, he did what is permissible for him to do and, in fact what he was obliged to do (that is, put effort into working out the direction). However, they differed as to whether he has to make up that prayer, if it became clear to him that he had made a mistake regarding the qiblah. Suggesting that he must repeat it means that it is obligatory, and what is obligatory cannot be proven except on the basis of certainty with no room for doubt.""(At-Tamhid\xa0 10429).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe correct view is that if he put effort into working it out when he was not travelling, then his prayer is valid. If he got it right, then the matter is clear; if he did not get it right, meaning that he put effort into working it out but got it wrong, he will still have reward for his effort. If he put effort into trying to work it out, he does not have to repeat the prayer at all, whether he got it right or not, because he did what was required of him. The one who has done what is required of him has done what he could to protect himself from the punishment of Allah, and whoever does what he can to protect himself from the punishment of Allah does not have to pray twice, because Allah has not obliged His slaves to do any act of worship twice, if they do it in the manner enjoined…\nSummary of the matter:\n1. If someone puts effort into trying to work it out, his prayer is valid, whether he got it wrong or right, and whether he is travelling or not, according to the more correct scholarly view.\n2. If he prayed without putting effort into trying to work it out and was not following someone else, then if he got it wrong, he must repeat the prayer, and if he got it right he does not have to repeat it, according to the correct view.""(Ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘\xa0 1/286-287).\nThere are many ways to work out the qiblah; it is not limited to one way. Each of these ways could indicate its direction, so they are valid ways of working it out.\nIbn ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe scholars are unanimously agreed that anyone who is far away from the Ka‘bah must turn his face towards it, so the one who cannot tell in what direction it is may look for whatever he can that will indicate its direction, such as the stars, the mountains, the winds and so on, from which he will be able to work out its direction.""(At-Tamheed\xa0 10/426).\nThe easiest way to work out the direction of the qiblah nowadays, which is the most readily available to people, is using a compass which shows the direction of the qiblah, especially as they are available on most modern cell phones, and there is no longer any need for a specialized instrument that may not be available to the Muslim when he needs it.\nIf you neglected to use the compass on your cell phone, even though you were aware of it and were aware of the importance of finding out the direction of the qiblah, then you must repeat your prayers.\nBut if it never crossed your mind, or you were not aware that it was there on your phone, or you did not know how to use it to find out the direction of the qiblah, and you made an analogy between your new apartment and your old apartment, and you believe that they faced the same direction, then we may note that analogy is one of the ways of finding things out, and we hope that there will be no blame on you for what you did, and that you have done what you could.\nBut if you think that you fell short and did not put enough effort into trying to work it out in order to be certain of the direction of the qiblah and find out its indications, or if you want to be on the safe side and be free of blame, then erring on the side of caution in such matters is a good idea.\nBased on that, you must repeat the prayers that you offered when you were not facing towards the qiblah. Making up prayers is to be done in the correct order and is to be done immediately, if you are able to do that.\nThe Permanent Committee for Academic Research and Ifta’ was asked:\nWhat is the order of making up Fajr, Zuhr and ‘Asr prayer when a person remembers that he has not prayed?\nAnswer: Making up missed prayers must be done immediately, and must be done in the proper order, as enjoined by Allah, may He be glorified. This means praying Fajr, then praying Zuhr, then praying ‘Asr.\nAnd Allah is the source of strength. May Allah send blessings upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.\nPermanent Committee for Academic Research and Ifta’\nShaykh ‘Abdullah ibn Munayyi‘, Shaykh ‘Abdullah ibn Ghadyan, Shaykh ‘Abd ar-Razzq ‘Afifi\nEnd quote from Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah – Vol. 1 (6/159).\nConclusion:\nWith regard to someone who prayed not facing towards the qiblah, if he put sufficient effort into trying to work it out and did what was required of him, then it turned out that he was not facing towards the qiblah, the prayer that he offered is valid and he does not have to repeat the prayer.\nBut if he was heedless about looking for indications of the qiblah, or he fell short in his efforts, he must repeat the prayers that he offered not facing towards the qiblah. He must offer them in order, to the best of his ability.\nIf he fears that he may have been negligent or did not put enough effort into finding indications of the qiblah, then it is a good idea for him to err on the side of caution and make up the prayers that he offered not facing towards the qiblah.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/483121/he-prayed-not-facing-towards-the-qiblah-for-a-month-does-he-have-to-repeat-the-prayers
320722,"I have a little boy who is five months old. How can I raise him to become one of the people of the Quran? How can I make him love the Quran? Should I start by making him listen to the Quran? What is best, to recite to myself or to play a recording of one of the reciters?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nOne of the ways in which a person may be blessed is when Allah enables him to do righteous deeds, and one of the best of righteous deeds is for a person to invest in his children. “When a person dies, his good deeds come to an end except three: ongoing charity, beneficial knowledge and a righteous child who offers supplication for him.” Narrated by at-Tirmidhi (1376).\nBringing up children to memorize the Quran is one of the noblest acts of worship and one of the best of good deeds.\nYour keenness to do this from this early age is a good sign that is indicative of righteousness and blessing, in sha Allah. Raising children, disciplining them in accordance with Islamic principles, and teaching them that which will benefit them in their religious and worldly affairs form a trust (amanah) that is borne by parents.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{O you who believe, guard yourselves and your families against a fire whose fuel is men and stones, over which are [appointed] angels harsh and stern, who do not disobey Allah in whatever He commands them, and they do whatever they are commanded to do}\n[at-Tahrim 66:6].\n‘Ali ibn Abi Talib (may Allah be pleased with him) said: [That is:] discipline them and teach them.\nIbn ‘Abbas said: [That is:] teach them to obey Allah and to avoid disobeying Allah, and instruct your families to remember Allah, and Allah will save them from the fire.\nMujahid said: [That is:] be mindful of Allah and advise your families to be mindful of Allah.\nQatadah said: He should instruct them to obey Allah and forbid them to disobey Allah, and he should take care of them as Allah has commanded, instruct them to follow His commands and help them to do that. So if you see any act of disobedience towards Allah, then stop them from doing that and rebuke them. See: Tafsir Ibn Kathir (8/167).\nSee also the answers to questions no. 162787 and 10016 .\nSecondly:\nYou should obey Allah so that the child will grow up righteous from the beginning. So let his food, drink and clothing be halal, for in that case blessing (barakah) will come down.\nThirdly:\nYou should make the child get used to hearing the Quran from an early age, so that from the beginning he will be aware of hearing its sound around him and recognize it as Quran. So you can play a recording of the Quran recited by one of the proficient reciters, such as Shaykh al-Husari, throughout the day, near the child.\nYou can also recite the Quran near him, so that the child can hear it.\nFourthly:\nWhen the child reaches an age where he is able to memorize, you should bring him to a proficient teacher who can teach him to memorize the Quran by hearing it, until he reaches an age when he will be able to learn how to recite properly.\nFifthly:\nAfter that, you can use various means to encourage him, such as organizing a family party with the aim of honouring the child when he memorizes a juz’ of the Holy Quran.\nFor more information, please see the answers to questions no. 10016 and 101752 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/320722/how-can-i-make-my-little-son-love-the-quran
150633,"Will a person (a believer) be rewarded if he listens to the Quran without understanding what he is listening to, but he knows that it is Quran? Or will he not be rewarded unless he understands what he is hearing? I hope you could give some evidence from the Quran and authentic Hadiths.","['Praise be to Allah.The command to listen to the Quran attentively\xa0\nAllah, may He be exalted, has commanded the believers to listen to the Quran attentively , in a general command. He says (interpretation of the meaning): “So, when the Quran is recited, listen to it, and be silent that you may receive mercy.” [Al-A`raf 7:204]\xa0\nShaykh As-Sa`di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“This command is general and includes everyone who hears the Book of Allah being recited. He is enjoined to listen to it and keep quiet. The difference between listening and keeping quiet is that keeping quiet is done outwardly by not speaking or being distracted with anything that would keep one from focusing on listening to it.\xa0\nAs for listening to it, this means that one hears it with an attentive heart, pondering the meaning of what one is listening to. The one who adheres to these two commands when the Book of Allah is recited will attain a great deal of good, beneficial knowledge, ongoing and renewed faith, increased guidance and insight into his religion. Hence Allah connected the attainment of mercy to them, which indicates that the one who does not keep quiet and listen attentively when the Book is recited to him will be deprived of the share of mercy and has missed out on a great deal of good.\xa0\nThe most emphatic command with regard to listening to the Quran attentively has to do with prayers in which Quran is recited out loud by the imam , in which one is enjoined to listen attentively, to such an extent that most of the scholars say that his focusing on keeping quiet and listening attentively takes priority over his reciting Al-Fatihah etc.” (Tafsir As-Sa`di, 314)\xa0\nThe greater aim of keeping quiet and listening attentively is so that the listener may ponder and understand the meanings, and act upon them.\xa0\nImam At-Tabari (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Allah says to those who believe in Him and in His Book, for whom the Quran is guidance and mercy: “So, when the Quran is recited”, to you, O believers; “listen to it”, i.e. lend your ears so that you might understand its verses and learn from its exhortation; “and be silent” and listen to it attentively, so that you might understand and ponder, and do not utter idle talk during it lest you do not understand; “that you may receive mercy” i.e., that you might receive the mercy of your Lord by heeding His exhortation and adhering to His limits and to what He enjoins upon you in the verses.” (Tafsir At-Tabari, 13/244)\xa0\nIf a person manages to achieve that, i.e., keeping quiet, listening attentively, pondering what is recited to him and understanding its meanings, that will bring him goodness in this world and the Hereafter.\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“By means of this listening, Allah guides His slaves and sets straight their affairs in this world and the Hereafter; with this the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was sent, and he enjoined it upon the Muhajirin and Ansar and those who followed them in truth. The early generations used to gather for this purpose. When the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) gathered together, they would tell one of their number to recite whilst they listened. `Umar ibn Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) would say to Abu Musa: Remind us of our Lord, and Abu Musa would recite the Quran whilst they listened.” (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 11/626)\xa0\nDo you get reward for listening to Quran without understanding it?\nAs listening in the complete sense is that in which one understands and ponders, there is no doubt that the one who does that as much as he is able is to be commended for what he does, and he is excused for what he is incapable of. But what one is incapable of should not be an excuse for not doing what one is able to do of goodness. What is possible is not to be omitted because of what is difficult; in other words, whatever a person is able to do of obligatory or recommended actions is not waived because of what he is incapable of doing, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “So keep your duty to Allah and fear Him as much as you can”\xa0[At-Taghabun 64:16] \xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\xa0\nWill a person be rewarded if he reads the Quran, even if he does not understand its meanings?\xa0\nHe replied:\xa0\n“The Glorious Quran is blessed, as Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “(This is) a Book (the Quran) which We have sent down to you, full of blessings, that they may ponder over its Verses, and that men of understanding may remember.” [Sad 38:29]\xa0\nSo man is enjoined to read it, whether he understands its meanings or not. But the believer who is enjoined to act upon it should not read the Quran without understanding its meanings. If a person wants to learn medicine, for example, and studies the books of medicine, he cannot benefit from them unless he understands their meanings and they are explained to him; in fact he will be very keen to understand the meanings so that he can apply them. So why do you think anyone should read the Book of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, which is a healing for what is in the hearts and exhortation to people, without pondering and without understanding its meanings? For this reason the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) would not move on from ten verses until they had learned them and learned the knowledge they contained and how to act upon it. So they learned the Quran and knowledge and action all together.\xa0\nA person will be rewarded for reading the Quran whether he understands its meanings or not, but he should be very keen to understand its meanings and to learn these meanings from scholars who are trustworthy in their knowledge. If he has no access to a scholar who can teach him the meanings, he may refer to the trustworthy books of Tafsir, such as Tafsir Ibn Jarir, Tafsir Ibn Kathir and others which pay attention to the Tafsir that is based on reports narrated from the Companions and the Successors (may Allah be pleased with them).” (Fatawa Nur `ala Ad-Darb)\xa0\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 106961 , 50010 , 124657 , 78370 , 174743 , 10672 , and 147164 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/150633/do-you-get-reward-for-listening-to-the-quran-without-understanding-it
