336566,Is salah invalid if we do not keep our back straight?,"['Praise be to Allah.Maintaining a straight back in Salah (formal prayer) is required in three positions:\nThe first position: (During standing) i.e., after the opening Takbir (Takbirat Al-Ihram).\nJurists have differed regarding the manner of standing. The Hanafis and Hanbalis say that one should stand in such a way that if they were to extend their hands, they would not reach their knees.\nIt is stated in ""Al-Jawharah An-Nayyirah"" (1/50): ""The limit of standing is such that if one extends their hands, they would not reach their knees."" End quote.\nSee: ""Al-Bahr Ar-Raiq"" (1/308), ""Hashiyah Ibn `Abidin"" (1/444), ""Sharh Muntaha Al-Iradat"" (1/194), and ""Al-Insaf fi Ma`rifat Al-Khilaf"" (3/480).\nThe Malikis and Shafi`is say: If one leans forward to the extent that they are closer to bowing than to standing, their Salah is invalidated.\nAn-Nawawi said in ""Al-Majmu`"" (3/261): ""The required straightness is the straightness of the spinal column. It is not permissible for one who is able to stand (straight) to lean\xa0to one side, deviating from the norms of standing, nor to stand bent as if in the position of those bowing; if the bending does not reach the extent of bowing but is closer to it, there are two views: the most correct of which is that their Salah is not valid because they are not standing straight. The second view is that it is valid because it is close to the required posture. If one lowers their head without bending, their Salah is valid without dispute because they are standing straight."" End quote. Also see: ""At-Taj wal-Iklil"" (1/419).\nTherefore, if the person praying bends and their bending is closer to bowing without an excuse, their Salah is invalidated according to the Malikis and Shafi`is.\nAccording to the Hanafis and Hanbalis, it is not invalidated unless it reaches the extent of bowing.\nThe second and third positions: (During straightening up) i.e., from bowing and prostration.\nThere is a Hadith from Abu Mas`ud Al-Badri, who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: ""A man\'s Salah is not valid until he straightens his back in bowing and prostration."" Reported by Abu Dawud (855), At-Tirmidhi (265) who said it is sound and authentic, An-Nasa’i (1027), and Ibn Majah (870).\nImam At-Tirmidhi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe practice of the scholars from among\xa0the Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) and those after them is upon this,\xa0as they believe that a man should straighten his spine in bowing and prostration.\nAsh-Shafi`i, Ahmad, and Ishaq said: Whoever does not straighten their spine in bowing and prostration, their Salah is invalid due to the Hadith of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him): ""A Salah is not valid if a man does not straighten his spine in bowing and prostration."" ""Sunan At-Tirmidhi"" (2/51).\nIt is also reported in ""Musnad Ahmad"" (10799) from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: ""Allah does not look at the Salah of a man who does not straighten his spine between his bowing and prostration.""\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in ""Majmu` Al-Fatawa"" (22/534):\n""This is explicit in that Salah is not valid until a man straightens up from bowing and stands straight from prostration; this indicates the obligation of straightening up in bowing and prostration...\nThat is because his statement (to straighten his back in bowing and prostration) means: when raising his head from them; for straightening the back is part of the completion of bowing and prostration; because when he bows, the bowing is from the moment he bends until he returns and straightens up, and prostration is from the moment of falling from standing or sitting until he returns and straightens up.\nThe lowering and raising are the ends and completion of bowing and prostration; therefore, he said: (to straighten his spine in bowing and prostration).""\nAnd this shows that the obligation of this straightening is like the obligation of completing bowing and prostration."" End quote.\nIt is narrated from Abu Wail, from Hudhayfah, that he saw a man who did not complete his bowing and prostration, so when he finished his Salah, Hudhayfah said to him: ""You have not prayed,"" and I think he also said: ""If you were to die, you would die not following the Sunnah of Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him)."" Reported by Al-Bukhari (382).\nIn another narration (758), from Zaid bin Wahb, he said: Hudhayfah saw a man who did not complete the bowing and prostration, he said: ""You have not prayed, and if you were to die, you would not die\xa0upon the natural disposition that Allah created Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) upon.""\nThe limit of straightening up from bowing here is the same as the limit of straightening up from standing after the opening Takbir.\nIt is stated in ""At-Taj wal-Iklil"" (1/419):\n""In At-Talqin: Among the pillars of Salah is raising from bowing.\nThere is a difference of opinion regarding straightening up in standing from it, and the preferred opinion is\xa0that it is obligatory to the extent that it is closer to standing, and likewise in the sitting between the two prostrations."" End quote.\nAl-Talqin is a book on the Maliki school by the judge `Abdul Wahhab (may Allah have mercy on him), one of the prominent figures of the Maliki school.\nAs for bending during the Tashahhud (testimony of faith) or sitting between the two prostrations, Ibn Hajar Al-Haytami, a Shafi`i scholar, mentioned in Tuhfat Al-Muhtaj (2/150) that if the one sitting bends to the extent that their forehead is level with their knees, their Salah is invalidated.\nAsh-Sharwani (may Allah have mercy on him) commented on this by saying: ""This is debatable"": ... then he mentioned that some Shafi`i scholars disagreed with Ibn Hajar on this.\nWhat is appropriate for the person praying is not to bend in their sitting to the extent that their forehead goes beyond their knees, but if they do bend, it should be less than that.\nIn conclusion: If the person praying bends during standing to the extent that it reaches the level of bowing, or is closer to bowing – according to the difference among scholars – their Salah is invalidated.\nAnd it is appropriate not to bend in sitting to the extent that the forehead goes beyond the knees.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/336566/guideline-on-what-constitutes-straightening-back-in-salah
292835,"I am a teenager, and while browsing the internet, I entered a site for chatting with strangers, and suddenly I saw a naked person fondling his private part, and suddenly a drop of semen was discharged from me involuntarily during my fasting, knowing that I did not fondle my private part, and I did not want that to happen, so what is legally required of me?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt is incumbent upon a person who sincerely advises themselves to be extremely cautious of following what their soul, which commands evil, and their devil whisper to them. Allah the Exalted says (translation of the meaning): {O you who have believed, do not follow the footsteps of Satan. And whoever follows the footsteps of Satan - indeed, he enjoins immorality and wrongdoing} (An-Nur 24:21).\nAbu Sa`id Al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: ""A man should not look at the private parts of another man, and a woman should not look at the private parts of another woman."" Reported by Muslim (338).\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n""This contains the prohibition of a man looking at the private parts of another man, and a woman looking at the private parts of another woman, and there is no disagreement on this."" End quote.\nSecondly:\nA Muslim must protect their hearing, sight, and limbs from engaging in what Allah the Exalted has prohibited, especially when fasting; for it is neither wise nor in accordance with the Shari`ah for a person to fast from what Allah has made lawful of good things, and then let their hearing, sight, and tongue indulge in what Allah has prohibited.\nAbu Hurairah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: ""Whoever does not give up false speech and acting upon it, Allah has no need for him to leave his food and drink."" Reported by Al-Bukhari (1804).\nAnd Jabir ibn Abdullah Al-Ansari said: When you fast, let your hearing, sight, and tongue fast from lying and sin, leave off harming the servant, and let there be upon you dignity and tranquility on the day of your fast, and do not make your day of breaking the fast and your day of fasting alike.\nFor further benefit, please see the answers to questions number: (93723 ), (50063 ), and (66699 ).\nThirdly:\nIf semen is discharged due to repeated looking, then according to the most correct opinion of the scholars, the fast is invalidated; contrary to the opinion of those who say it does not break the fast, just as ejaculation due to thought does not break the fast.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n""Our argument is that it is ejaculation caused by an act that one finds pleasure in, and it is possible to avoid; therefore, it invalidates the fast, like ejaculation caused by touching.\nThinking is not something one can avoid, unlike repeated looking."" End quote from ""Al-Mughni"" (3/129).\nIn conclusion:\nWhat you must do regarding what you have done are two things:\n- Hasten to repent to Allah for what has emanated from you, hoping that He may accept your repentance and forgive you.\n- Make up for that day, and there is no expiation required from you, because expiation is only obligatory for someone who invalidates their fast through sexual intercourse.

Did he do Ghusl before going to sleep, or did he go to sleep before doing Ghusl? She said: He did both; sometimes he would do Ghusl then go to sleep, and sometimes he would do Wudu then go to sleep.
