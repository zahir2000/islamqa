223267,"My father borrowed some gold jewellery from his wife to build a house for me, without my knowledge. Please note that I sent him the costs of construction, and I asked him whether there was anything left of the money, and he told me no. Then after my father died, his wife told me that my father had borrowed the jewellery from her, and he said to her in the presence of my sisters: Take back what is owed from my son. My sisters testify to that. She said that there were papers documenting that, but she lost them; they listed the different weights of the jewellery. What am I obliged to do? If the answer is that I have to pay it, then should I pay the current price of the gold, or the price as it was six years ago? Please note that I do not live in the house, because it was destroyed as a result of war.","['Praise be to Allah.If you are sure that your father’s wife’s claim is true, especially since there is testimony from your sisters about your father’s instructions, then you must pay off this debt to her, but it should be paid from the estate, before it is divided. In other words, the debt should be paid off from what your father left behind of money or property, because it is a debt that is owed by him, and it is not owed by you, because – according to what is mentioned in the question, you did not appoint him to borrow it on your behalf and you did not ask him to do that; rather you were unaware of this debt until after he died. As that is the case, you are not required to do anything. If your father told others that he had borrowed it for your sake, he had no right to do that according to Islamic teachings.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe heirs are not obliged to pay off the debt [of the deceased]; rather it must be paid from his estate.""(Minhaj as-Sunnah\xa0 5/232).\nSee also the answer to question no. 43085 .\nIf your father did not leave behind any wealth after he died, the heirs are not obliged to pay off this debt.\nBut our advice to you is to pay off this debt on your father’s behalf from your own wealth, especially if he did not have sufficient wealth to pay it off and you can afford to pay it. That will be a way of showing kindness to him after his death, because his aim was to help you and make things easier for you. Hence the least you could do is respond to kindness with kindness and pay off what he asked you to pay off, according to the testimony of your sisters.\nIt was narrated that Abu Usayd – a companion of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) – said: Whilst I was sitting with the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), an Ansari man came to him and said: O Messenger of Allah, is there anything left that I could do to honour my parents after their death?\nHe said: “[There are] four things: offering supplication for them, praying for forgiveness for them, fulfilling their promises, honouring their friends, and upholding ties of kinship, for you have no ties of kinship except through them. These are the things that remain, through which you may honour them after their death.” Narrated by Imam Ahmad in al-Musnad (25/457).\nFulfilling their promises includes carrying out the instructions that your father gave. Even though this is not obligatory for you, as noted above, it comes under the heading of showing kindness to your father and honouring him.\nAnd you will have reward with Allah, may He be glorified.\nPay off the debt according to the price of gold on the day when you want to pay it off, not the date on which the loan was given. Or you can give the same amount of gold, which is better.\nPlease see also the answer to question no. 136609 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/223267/is-the-son-obliged-to-pay-off-his-fathers-debt
290605,"I had a problem with my grandmother when she was sick. She said to me: “This is my wasiyyah (instructions) to you” in front of my maternal aunt and her daughters. The wasiyyah said: “I do not want to see you when I am alive or when I am dead, not when they wash my body, not when they bury me and not when people gather to offer condolences to the family. I disavow you until the Day of Judgement. I wish that you had died with your mother and that I never laid eyes on you.” What is the ruling on this wasiyyah?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIf you were innocent of this accusation and you did not touch anything of her wealth, then you have nothing to worry about and her claims will not harm you. You should be patient and seek reward with Allah, for Allah has made a promise to those who are patient, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{but give good tidings to the patient\nWho, when disaster strikes them, say, “Indeed we belong to Allah, and indeed to Him we will return.”\nThose are the ones upon whom are blessings from their Lord and mercy. And it is those who are the [rightly] guided}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:155-157].\nSecondly:\nA wasiyyah giving instructions to prevent someone from visiting a person when he is alive or from attending his burial and condolence gathering if he dies is a haram kind of wasiyyah, because of what it includes of calling for severing ties of kinship. Hence it does not have to be carried out.\nIt is not obligatory to carry out any wasiyyah except that which instructs people to do righteous deeds.\nIbn Rushd (may Allah have mercy on him) said: There is no obligation to carry out a wasiyyah except one which gives instructions to do righteous deeds.""(Al-Bayan wa’t-Tahsil\xa0 2/287).\nKhalil said in his Mukhtasar: The wasiyyah is invalid if the person apostatizes or if it gives instructions to commit sin. End quote.\nIt says in Minah al-Jalil (9/512): [The wasiyyah] is invalid if it gives instructions to commit sin, such as if the person bequeaths money to one who will use it to buy wine and drink it, or to kill someone whose life is protected by Islamic law, or to wail for him. End quote.\nThe jurists stipulated that the instructions given in the wasiyyah should not involve sin, as was narrated above from the jurists.\nIt says in al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (43/258), on the topic of conditions regarding instructions given in a wasiyyah:\nThe instructions should not involve sin or anything that is prohibited according to Islamic teachings:\n51. The purpose of giving instructions before death (wasiyyah) is to make up for what the person has missed of righteous deeds during his lifetime, so it is not permissible for the instructions to involve any sin. End quote.\nMoreover, when the jurists speak of wasiyyah, they speak of bequeathing wealth that has value, or whatever comes under the same heading. [See: al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (43/254-258)]. Based on that, this and similar questions do not come under the heading of wasiyyah at all. The purpose behind quoting the words of the jurists here is to highlight that the fact that they stated that it is haram to give any instructions that involve sin indicates that such behaviour is not allowed. Moreover, this kind of instruction does not come under the heading of the wasiyyah that the jurists usually discuss at all, even if there is no sin involved. So how about if the wasiyyah involves sin and an attempt to assert control that serves no purpose for the deceased whatsoever; in fact it comes under the heading of mischief that would lead to more enmity and rancour, and calls for sin and severing ties of kinship, as is quite obvious?\nConclusion:\nThese instructions to prevent someone from attending the funeral of the deceased or praying for him, and the like, do not come under the heading of wasiyyah as it is known in Islamic teachings, which must be carried out. Rather they are more akin to sin and severing ties of kinship, as may be understood from the question. The deceased has no right to do that and there is no interest to be served by it, in addition to what it involves of depriving the deceased of supplication for him and prayers for his forgiveness. All of that is prohibited.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/290605/a-haram-wasiyyah-instructions-given-by-one-who-is-dying
