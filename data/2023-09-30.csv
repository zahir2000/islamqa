311585,I had been married to my husband for two years and we have one child together. I am now 4 months pregnant and about 2 months ago I was granted a Khulah. Now me and my ex regret this choice and I feel as though I could have been more patient with him in our marriage. do I have to wait until I give birth and clean from my bleeding before I can remarry him or can I do it while I am pregnant,"['Praise be to Allah.Khul‘ means that the wife is completely divorced from the husband in the sense of minor divorce, and she is not permissible for the one who divorced her by khul‘ except with a new marriage contract.\nWhat is required of the woman who has been divorced by khul‘ is to observe ‘iddah for one menstrual cycle, according to the correct scholarly view, unless she is pregnant, in which case her ‘iddah ends when she gives birth.\nIt is permissible for her former husband to do a new marriage contract with her and consummate the marriage with her during her ‘iddah; what is prohibited is for someone else to marry her during her ‘iddah.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If a man divorces his wife by khul‘ or annuls the marriage, he may remarry her during her ‘iddah according to the view of the majority of jurists. This is the view of Sa‘id ibn al-Musayyab, ‘Ata’, Tawus, az-Zuhri, al-Hasan, Qatadah, Malik, ash-Shafa‘i and ashab ar-ra’y.\nSome of the later scholars had an odd view and said: it is not permissible for him to marry her or propose to her, because she is observing ‘iddah.\nOur view is that the purpose of the ‘iddah is to preserve his lineage and protect his semen [from being mixed with that of another man, if she were to marry someone else during her ‘iddah] and there is no point in protecting his own semen from his semen, if their initial marriage was valid.""(Al-Mughni\xa0 8/127).\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his Tafsir (1/620): All scholars are agreed that the one who divorced his wife by khul‘ may remarry her during her ‘iddah. Shaykh Abu ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-Barr narrated from a group that it is not permissible for him to do that, just as it is not permissible for anyone else, but this is an odd view and is to be rejected. End quote.\nBased on that:\nThere is nothing wrong with you doing a new marriage contract now, before giving birth.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/311585/ruling-on-a-woman-divorced-by-khul-remarrying-the-one-who-divorced-her-when-she-is-still-observing-iddah
113584,"I am a student in a university in France and I live with my family. I do not want to continue my studies, yet I signed up in university to study. I receive a monthly grant to spend on my study, but I did not go to university since the educational year started except few times. I intended to leave study totally and attend only the exams, as I fear they stop giving me the grant. What is the ruling on taking this grant, knowing that I spend most of it on my family and friends?","['Praise be to Allah.If the matter is as you mention, that you received this grant legally, there is nothing wrong with you accepting it, even if you have decided to give up your study completely, so long as you have not actually given it up yet.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/113584/she-received-a-grant-to-spend-on-her-study-but-she-has-decided-to-give-up-her-study
