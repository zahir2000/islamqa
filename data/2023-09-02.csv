140931,"A woman is asking, after having repented to Allah for wealth that she accumulated through begging: This wealth includes two dwellings for my children and some small businesses. Please note that she is a widow and has no income.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly: undoubtedly begging and asking of people when one is not in need is haram.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: There are mutawatir hadiths from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) which indicate that it is prohibited to ask of people except in the case of necessity.""(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa\xa0 8/538).\nWe have previously discussed the prohibition on begging and the circumstances in which it is permissible, and the evidence for that, in the answer to question no. 104781 .\nSecondly: the wealth that has been accumulated through begging and asking of people without being in need is unlawful wealth, because it was taken in a manner that is not permissible according to Islamic teachings, as the one who gave it in charity to the beggar only gave it to him because he thought that the one who was asking for it was in need and poor.\nBased on that, this woman must get rid of this wealth by spending it on charitable causes and giving it to the poor and needy on behalf of those who donated it.\nWhatever has been spent of this wealth, no action is required regarding it.\nIf the woman is in need, then she may take of it as much as she needs and will suffice her. That includes what she has bought with this money of dwellings and shops and the like. But she should limit it to as much as she and her children need, and get rid of the rest.\nPlease see the answer to question no. 78289 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/140931/she-accumulated-wealth-through-begging-and-built-her-house-with-it-how-can-she-repent
423150,Is it permissible for a patient who takes narcotic medicine to pray?,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe basic principle is that it is not permissible to take narcotic medicines or drugs, especially if their effect is powerful and has a clear impact on the patient’s consciousness and understanding.\nBut if it is necessary, and the doctors have decided that the patient should take this narcotic medicine, and there is no non-narcotic alternative, then it is permissible for him to take it, subject to certain conditions.\nIt was stated in the Eighth Medical Fiqh Conference: An Islamic View of some Medical Problems – which was held in Kuwait –:\nNarcotic substances are prohibited, and it is not permissible to take them except for the purpose of specific medical treatment, in the amounts prescribed by the doctors, if they are pure (tahir) in and of themselves.""(Al-Fiqh al-Islami wa Adillatuhu, Wahbah az-Zuhayli 7/5266).\nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 192321 .\nSecondly:\nWith regard to the validity of the prayer of someone who takes a narcotic medicine at the time when he is taking it, there are two scenarios:\nThe first scenario is where he becomes unconscious when taking it, or he does not fully know what he is saying or doing. In this case his prayer is not valid until he comes back to full consciousness and awareness, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {O you who have believed, do not approach prayer while you are intoxicated until you know what you are saying} [An-Nisa’ 4:43].\nThe second scenario is where he knows fully what he is saying and doing when he takes the narcotic medicine. In this case, his prayer is valid. The scholars have stated that the prayer of one who is intoxicated is valid if he is aware of what he is saying, so that is more likely to be applicable in this case.\nAsh-Shafa‘i (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If someone who has drunk something haram prays and is not intoxicated, he is sinning for having drunk that haram thing, but he does not have to repeat his prayer.""(Al-Umm\xa0 1/88).\nShaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about the one who prays after having drunk alcohol when he is aware of what he is saying. He replied: His prayer is valid if he prayed when he was sober and the drunkenness had left him; he may do wudu’ and pray. But if he is in a state of intoxication, then his prayer is not valid because he is not aware of what he is saying.""(Fatawa Nur ‘ala ad-Darb by Ibn Baz\xa0 6/25).\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah stated that the prayer of one who has consumed alcohol or hashish is valid if he prays when he knows what he is saying.\nSee: Majmu‘ al-Fatawa (33/103; 23/358).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/423150/is-the-patients-prayer-valid-if-he-takes-narcotic-medicine
