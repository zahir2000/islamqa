269007,"I found someone who had a wheelchair for rent or purchase in the street next to the Haram in Makkah, and I bought the wheelchair from him for approximately 200 riyals. There was a policeman nearby, and when I asked him about the price of wheelchairs in the shops, I found out that they are sold for no less than approximately 600 riyals. And I used the wheelchair. Please note that there was no writing on the wheelchair to indicate that it was for charity. I hope that you can advise me as to whether that was a valid transaction, especially since my mother used it when doing the rituals of ‘umrah.","['Praise be to Allah.The cheapness of an item does not necessarily indicate that it is stolen goods. It may be fake, or the owner may be rich and no longer needs it, and he does not want to keep it as he no longer has any use for it, so he sells it cheaply, or he asks for a price lower than its real value because he wants to benefit visitors to the House of Allah, or there may be other reasons.\nIf the individual knows that the item is stolen, it is not permissible for him to buy it, because that comes under the heading of consuming people’s wealth unlawfully, and is also cooperating in sin and transgression. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And cooperate in righteousness and piety, but do not cooperate in sin and transgression. And fear Allah; indeed, Allah is severe in penalty}\xa0[al-Ma’idah 5:2].\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about buying stolen goods, and he replied:\nWhat appears to be the case, based on shar‘i evidence, is that it is not permissible for you to buy it, if it is clear to you or you think it most likely that it was stolen, because Allah, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning): {but do not cooperate in sin and transgression} [al-Ma’idah 5:2].\nAnd because you know or think it most likely that the seller is not the rightful owner of the item, and it is not permitted, according to Islamic teachings, to sell it. So how can you help him in his wrongdoing, and take the property of someone else unlawfully?""(Fatawa Ibn Baz\xa0 19/92).\nShaykh al-Albani was asked:\nIs it permissible to buy an item that was possibly stolen for a price that is cheaper than the usual price?\nShaykh: The possibility of its having been stolen may vary, and rulings cannot be based on speculation and delusion. If the possibility is based on what is most likely to be the case, then it is not permissible to buy this item. Most shar‘i rulings are based on what the accountable person thinks is most likely to be the case. As for a mere passing thought, it is not permissible to go along with that thought and accept it, for that will lead to intrusive thoughts and illusions. End quote.\nBut if there is no sound likelihood of that, then the individual is not obliged to check and try to find out who the real owner of what is being offered for sale is. The basic principle is that items that being offered for sale belong to the one in whose hands they are.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/269007/he-found-an-item-being-sold-for-a-cheap-price-and-thinks-that-it-is-stolen-goods-can-he-buy-it
20872,"My parents treated me very badly, to such an extent that I lost my self-confidence and became hesitant and fearful. I couldn’t do anything right and I did not know how to make a decision. I got married and Allah has blessed me with a daughter. I want to avoid what happened to me so that this regrettable experience is not repeated with my daughter. What do you advise me to do?","['Praise be to Allah.When do daughters form their attitudes towards the world?\nAt the age of two, a child starts to form her attitude towards the world around her. Some developmental psychologists think that the sense of self-confidence is one of the first of these attitudes and the strength of these feelings at age 2 depends on the kind of care that the child receives and on the parents’ attitude in meeting her basic needs.\xa0\nAt this stage, the child shows signs of development by showing a desire for independence, as she needs the freedom to speak, walk and play. All of that is connected to the need to assert herself which can only be achieved by allowing her a measure of independence.\xa0\nThis is confirmed by the theory of development through maturity which says that we should respect the child’s individuality and leave him or her to develop naturally.\xa0\nReasons for lack of self-confidence\nSome girls grow up lacking self-confidence such that they cannot rely upon themselves in any matter, major or minor. They rarely take any initiative and are always waiting for someone to say, “Do such and such.”\nIf faced with a problem, such a girl will be unable to take any decision and may try to avoid confronting the problem, or start crying. This is partly the parents’ fault, and it may be for a number of reasons, such as:\n\nToo much control (“Do this, don’t do that”) in major and minor matters alike, even if the matter does not warrant it, so that the child loses her spontaneity and this makes her lose confidence in her actions, and instead she always waits for someone to correct her and reassure her that she is doing the right thing.\nBlaming and criticizing her for everything she does, exposing her faults and rebuking her if she makes a mistake, so that she is blamed and rebuked more than she deserves at the time when she is expecting praise for her efforts. This destroys the child’s motivation to act or to compete in doing anything and doing it well.\nNot giving the child the opportunity to speak in front of others for fear that she may make a mistake or speak of things that are not desirable, or else allowing her to speak but telling her what she should say.\nGiving her too many warnings about danger, which will make her always expect the worst and imagine that she is surrounded by danger on all sides.\nPutting her down or comparing her to others, which makes her think that she has no worth.\nMaking fun of her and mocking her.\nNot paying attention to her questions.\nPaying too much attention in a manner that shows excessive worry about her health or her future.\n\nNegative effects of lack of self-confidence\nLack of self-confidence has many negative effects on the child, such as:\n\nShe will not be able to do anything independently, and if she is asked to bring something and finds that it differs from the description given, she will be hesitant; if she is faced with a problem she will be unable to make a decision.\nShe will become dull-witted and not creative.\nShe will start to complain and feel unhappy whenever anything is asked of her, because she thinks that she will be blamed for whatever she does and that she will not be able to do it in the manner required.\nShe will become weak-willed and will have no resolve, and she will feel meek and apathetic in situations where such attitudes are not appropriate, and will become neglectful and disorganized.\nShe will suffer anxiety and frustration, and will develop a hostile attitude or a tendency to become introverted and withdrawn.\n\nHow parents boost daughter’s self-confidence\nIn order to avoid these negative effects on the child, parents should use a number of ways to develop the child’s self-confidence. Some examples follow, but this is not a complete list:\n\nThey should draw up some general guidelines to follow by telling her what Allah has made permissible, which she may do, and what He has forbidden, which she must avoid. They should make her aware of noble attributes and good manners, and instill in her a dislike for bad manners, deeds and words, and the need to steer clear of trivial matters. Then after that they should give her the freedom to act on her own initiative.\nThe mother should assign her some tasks that she is able to do. If she makes a mistake, the mother should praise her for her initiative and encourage her, then tell her what she should have done. Sometimes she should just praise her for her efforts, then complete the work in a gentle manner, without telling her directly. If the task is not something that the child is able to do, then the mother may do it and consult the child and ask for her opinion, and let the child state what she thinks is good and is not, so that the child will realize that everyone is vulnerable to making mistakes but also gets things right sometimes. This will strengthen her resolve.\nThe parents should try to praise the child in front of her relatives and friends, and give her rewards commensurate with her efforts. They should praise her for the acts of worship that she does, such as praying regularly, memorizing Quran, doing well in her studies, having a good attitude, and so on.\nThey should give her a nickname that will distinguish her from others, but they should not allow anyone to call her by a bad nickname. If she makes them angry they should call her by her real name, so that she will realize that she has fallen short in her duty to one or both of them, or that she has wronged somebody, so that she will realize that.\nStrengthening her will-power, by getting her used to two things, namely:\n\n\nKeeping secrets: when she knows how to keep secrets and not divulge them, then her will-power will develop and grow stronger, and thus her self-confidence will increase.\nGetting her used to fasting, for when she stands firm in the face of hunger and thirst when fasting, she will feel the joy of achieving victory over her Nafs (self), which will strengthen her will-power when facing life, and in turn, this will increase her self-confidence.\n\n\nStrengthening her confidence in dealing with other people. This may be done by getting her to do housework, obeying the parents’ commands, and letting her sit with the adults and get together with other youngsters.\nStrengthening her confidence in gaining knowledge, by teaching her the Quran and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and his biography, so that she will grow up having acquired abundant knowledge in childhood, and thus develop a sense of confidence in the knowledge that she has, because she will have gained the basic principles of true knowledge, far removed from myths and legends.\n\nWhat causes a child to feel inadequate?\nParents must take some precautions and take effective measures to save the child from feeling inadequate. Some of the things that cause a child to feel inadequate are: belittling her, humiliating her and mocking her, such as calling her by offensive names and words in front of her siblings and relatives, or even in front of her friends or in front of strangers whom she has never met before.\xa0\nThese are matters which may make her regard herself as insignificant and worthless, or may generate psychological complexes that will make her look at others with hatred and dislike, and make her withdraw into herself in order to escape from life.\nEven if the offensive words that slip from the parents’ tongues are only for the purpose of disciplining the child for some mistake, great or small, it is not right to use this method to correct her, as this will have a bad effect on the child’s psyche and personal conduct, and it will make her accustomed to the language of condemnation and insult that will destroy her psychologically and morally.\nThe best way of dealing with this problem is to explain to the child, in a gentle manner, where she has gone wrong and to give her proof that will convince her to avoid the mistake in future; the parents should not scold her, and certainly not in front of others. The parents should use good methods in correcting her from the outset, following the example of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in the way he reformed and trained people and corrected their mistakes. For the child is very sensitive and readily influenced, irrational and helpless. Building the child’s self-confidence is the first step in building her personality through all stages of life.\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 215167 , 88153 , 162787 , 10016 , 217409 , and 224758 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20872/how-to-boost-your-daughters-self-confidence-in-islam
274076,Is Masjid al-Qiblatayn (the Mosque of the Two Qiblahs) the mosque in which the Sahabah turned around whilst praying when someone told them about the change of the qiblah? Or is it called thus because the verses about the change of the qiblah were revealed to the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in it?,"['Praise be to Allah.This incident happened in more than one of the mosques of Madinah at that time, yet despite that the mosques were not called by this name.\nThe Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) turned around to face towards the Ka‘bah whilst they were praying in Masjid Quba’, as is proven in the hadith of Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him).\nThey also turned around whilst they were praying in the masjid of Banu Harithah, as was mentioned in the hadith of al-Bara’ ibn ‘Azib (may Allah be pleased with him).\nWhat was mentioned by the biographers about Masjid al-Qiblatayn and the reason for its name has to do with the masjid of Banu Salamah. It was said that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) visited Umm Bishr, and the time came for Zuhr prayer. Whilst he was praying, he was commanded to face towards the Ka‘bah, so he turned around. The scholars and commentators attribute this report to Tabaqat Ibn Sa‘d.\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe reports differ concerning the prayer during which the qiblah was changed, and the mosque in which that happened…\nMuhammad ibn Sa‘d said in al-Tabaqat: It was said that he had led the Muslims in praying two rak‘ahs of Zuhr in his mosque, then he was commanded to face towards al-Masjid al-Haram, so he turned around to face it and the Muslims turned around with him.\nIt was also said that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) visited Umm Bishr ibn al-Bara’ ibn Ma‘rur in Bani Salamah, and she made some food for him. The time for Zuhr came, so the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) led his companions in praying two rak‘ahs, then he was commanded to turn around to face the Ka‘bah, so he turned to face towards it. Hence that place was named Masjid al-Qiblatayn.\nIbn Sa‘d said: al-Waqidi said: This is more sound in our view.""(Fath al-Bari\xa0 2/116).\nThis was also narrated in al-Tabaqat al-Kubra (1/241).\nIbn Kathir said:\nMore than one of the commentators and others stated that the change of the qiblah was revealed to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) when he had prayed two rak‘ahs of Zuhr. That happened in the mosque of Banu Salamah, which became known as Masjid al-Qiblatayn.\nIn the hadith of Nuwaylah bint Muslim, it says that news of that reached them when they were praying Zuhr, so the men moved to the women’s place and the women moved to the men’s place. This was quoted by Shaykh Abu ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-Barr al-Nimri.\nWith regard to the people of Quba’, the news did not reach them until the time of Fajr prayer on the following day, as it was narrated in al-Sahihayn from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both) that he said: Whilst the people in Quba’ were praying Fajr, someone came to them and said: ‘Last night Qur’an came down to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and he was instructed to face towards the Ka‘bah, so turn around to face towards it.’ They were facing towards al -Sham (Greater Syria), then they turned around to face towards the Ka‘bah.""(Tafsir Ibn Kathir\xa0 1/237).\nThis hadith – as is clear – was quoted by Ibn Sa‘d without any isnad, and he quoted it with wording which indicates that there is some doubt and that he was not certain of its soundness, as he said: “It was said… it was said.” Such a report cannot be relied on and there can be no certainty that it is sound.\nBut these are historical reports and no action is based on them. But there is nothing wrong with narrating them by way of telling the story, not by way of affirming its soundness.\nIt is not recommended for the visitor to Madinah to go and visit any of these places in Madinah and its environs, whether the hadith about the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) praying there is sound or not.\nPlease see also the answer to question no. 11669 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/274076/he-is-asking-about-masjid-al-qiblatayn-and-the-reason-for-its-name
69789,"May Allah reward you for your efforts. In the time of our Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), how did the Muslims distinguish themselves from the disbelievers in their dressing? Did the disbelievers of Mecca also wear long robes (commonly known today as kurtas, jallabias etc.)? So can the wearing of the loose robe be considered as an Islamic dress code?","[""Praise be to Allah.Islamic dress code\nClothing is one of the blessings that Allah has bestowed upon His slaves. It covers the `Awrah and protects against heat and cold. Allah has bestowed this blessing upon them as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“O Children of Adam! We have bestowed raiment upon you to cover yourselves (screen your private parts) and as an adornment; and the raiment of righteousness, that is better. Such are among the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of Allah, that they may remember.” [Al-A`raf 7:26]\xa0\n“… and has made for you garments to protect you from the heat (and cold), and coats of mail to protect you from your (mutual) violence. Thus does He perfect His Favour unto you, that you may submit yourselves to His Will (in Islam).”\xa0[An-Nahl 16:81]\nThe basic principle concerning garments is that they are permissible, and the Muslim may wear whatever he wants of things that he has made or that Muslims or others have made for him. This is what the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) did in Makkah and elsewhere. Those who became Muslim did not wear special garments that were just for them.\xa0\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) wore Syrian garments and Yemeni cloaks, and the people who made them were not Muslims. What matters is that the garment should meet the conditions stipulated by Shari`ah .\xa0\nProhibition to imitate the disbelievers\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade resembling the disbelievers in general – in clothing and in other ways. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever imitates a people is one of them .” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 4031; classed as authentic by Al-`Iraqi in Takhrij Ihya’ `Ulum Ad-Din (1/342) and by Al-Albani in Irwa’ Al-Ghalil, 5/109.)\xa0\nWhat clothes are prohibited in Islam?\nThe Prophet also specifically forbade resembling them in clothing. `Abdullah ibn `Amr ibn Al-`As (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw him wearing two garments dyed with safflower and he said to him: “These are the garments of the disbelievers; do not wear them.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2077)\xa0\nMuslim (2069) narrated from `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that he wrote to the Muslims in Azerbaijan saying: “Beware of luxury and the clothing of the people of shirk.”\xa0\nThe garments of the disbelievers which the Muslims are forbidden to wear are those which are worn exclusively by the disbelievers and are not worn by anyone else. As for those which are worn by both disbelievers and Muslims, there is nothing wrong with wearing them and that is not disliked, because they are not exclusive to the disbelievers.\xa0\nThe scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas were asked about the imitation of the disbelievers that is forbidden. They replied:\xa0\n“What is meant by the imitation of the disbelievers that is forbidden is resembling them in the customs that are exclusive to them, or in the religious beliefs and acts of worship that they have invented, such as imitating them by shaving the beard.\xa0\nWith regard to wearing pants , suits and so on, the basic principle is that all types of clothing are permissible, because this is a matter of customs. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Say (O Muhammad): Who has forbidden the adornment with clothes given by Allah, which He has produced for His slaves, and At-Tayyibat [all kinds of lawful things] of food?”\xa0[Al-A`raf 7:32]\nAn exception from that is made in the case of that for which there is Shar`i evidence proving something to be forbidden or disliked, such as silk for men, or that which shows the `Awrah because it is thin and shows the colour of the skin beneath it, or because it is tight and shows the shape of the `Awrah , because in that case it is like showing it, and showing it is prohibited.\xa0\nSimilarly, clothing which is worn exclusively by the disbelievers is not permitted for men or for women, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade imitating them. Also, it is not permitted for men to wear women's clothing or women to wear men’s clothing, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade men to imitate women and women to imitate men.\xa0\nWearing pants or trousers is not something that is exclusive to the disbelievers, because that is something that is worn by both Muslims and disbelievers in many countries. Rather some people do not like to wear such things in some countries because they are not used to it and it is contrary to the customary dress of the people, even though it is customary among other Muslims.\xa0 However, if the Muslim is in a country where the people are not accustomed to such clothing, it is better for him not to wear it when praying or in public gatherings or in the street.” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Al-Da’imah, 3/307-309)\xa0\nThey also said:\n“Muslim men and women should be keen to adhere to Islamic customs and attitudes, and to follow the Islamic way in their expressions of joy and sorrow and in their clothing, food, drink and all their affairs.\xa0\nIt is not permissible for them to imitate the disbelievers in their clothing by wearing tight clothes that show the shape of the `Awrah, or by wearing thin and see-through clothes that show the `Awrah and do not conceal it, or by wearing short clothes that do not cover the chest, forearms, neck, head or face.” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 3/306, 307)\xa0\nDefinition of imitating the disbelievers\nShaykh Muhammad ibn Salih Al-`Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about the definition of imitating the disbelievers. He replied:\xa0\n“The definition of imitation is: doing what is exclusive to those who are being imitated, so imitating the disbelievers refers to a Muslim doing something that is distinct and exclusive to them.\xa0\nWith regard to things that have become widespread among the Muslims and are no longer something which distinguishes disbelievers from Muslims, then this is not imitation, so it is not prohibited on the grounds that it is imitation, unless it is prohibited for some other reason.\xa0\nWhat we have said is what is indicated by this word, and it was explained in a similar way by the author of Fath Al-Bari when he said (10/272): Some of the Salaf regarded it as disliked to wear the burnous because it was the garment of monks. Malik (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about it and he said: ‘There is nothing wrong with it. It was said to him: But it is the clothing of the Christians. He said: It is worn here.’ End quote.\xa0\nI say: It would have been stronger evidence if, when Malik (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked whether wearing the burnous is prohibited, he had quoted as evidence the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “(The pilgrim in Ihram) should not wear a shirt, pants, a burnous…” \xa0\nIn Al-Fath (10/307) it also says: If we say that they (silken saddlepads) are forbidden because that is an imitation of the non-Arabs, then this is a religious reason, but that was their symbol at that time when they were disbelievers, but now it is not something it is unique to them so this meaning no longer applies, so it is no longer disliked. And Allah knows best.” (Majmu` Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin, 12/290)\xa0\nShaykh Salih Al-Fawzan (may Allah preserve him) said:\xa0\n“It is permissible to wear the garments of disbelievers so long as they are not known to be impure, because the basic principle is that things are pure, and that is not altered by doubt. So what they have woven and dyed is permissible, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his companions used to wear things that had been woven and died by the disbelievers.” (Al-Mulakhkhas Al-Fiqhi, 1/20)\xa0\nTo sum up, it is prohibited for a Muslim to imitate the disbelievers in things that are exclusive to them, whether it be clothing or anything else, but whatever is not exclusive to the disbelievers, there is nothing wrong with it.\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/69789/forbidden-types-of-disbelievers-clothing
