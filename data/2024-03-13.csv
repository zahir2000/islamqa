455054,"I do not smoke or vape but I do use nicotine gum as I find it to be relaxing, is this halal?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nNicotine is an organic, semi-alkaline, toxic compound and is considered one of the most harmful substances found in tobacco. .It is the substance that causes addiction in smokers\nSecondly:\nNicotine gum is a medical gum taken orally under prescription and medical supervision, providing a dose of nicotine. Its purpose is to replace the nicotine that individuals might get from smoking cigarettes or other tobacco products during withdrawal symptoms, thereby reducing their severity. While the gum contains the chemical responsible for cigarette addiction, nicotine, it does not contain other harmful substances such as tar and also does not cause intoxication. Nicotine gum works to alleviate the severity of nicotine withdrawal symptoms because it compensates the body for the nicotine that is withdrawn due to the sudden cessation of smoking.\nDespite its benefits and effectiveness in quitting smoking, incorrect use may lead to an alternative addiction to cigarette nicotine, thus entering an endless cycle of nicotine.\nNicotine gum: how to use it and how to avoid addiction to it? - At-Ta`afi Hospital (altaafi.com)\nThis gum has harmful side effects if not used under a doctor\'s supervision.\n""Some harms appear in case of incorrect use and non-adherence to the specified dose, the most prominent of which are:\n- Pain in the mouth, teeth, or jaw.\n- Feeling dizzy.\n- Nausea and vomiting.\n- Severe diarrhea.\n- Weakness and lethargy.\n- Rapid heartbeat.\n- Difficulty breathing.\n- Appearance of a skin rash.\n- Presence of blisters in the mouth."" End quote from:\nBenefits, harms, and price of nicotine gum, the easiest drug to quit smoking | Bareeq Hospital (bareeqeg.com)\nThirdly:\n\xa0If Allah has spared you from smoking, then you are bringing harm upon yourself by using this gum, and it may lead to addiction to it. The basic\xa0 principle is the prohibition of what is harmful; as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): {And do not kill yourselves [or one another]. Indeed, Allah is to you ever Merciful.} (An-Nisa\': 29), and He says (interpretation of the meaning): {And do not throw [yourselves] with your [own] hands into destruction. And do good; indeed, Allah loves the doers of good.} (Al-Baqarah: 195).\nAnd the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him)\xa0said: ""There should be neither harming nor reciprocating harm."" Narrated by Ahmad and Ibn Majah (2341) and authenticated by Al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah.\nAlso, spending a lot of money on it is considered extravagance or wastefulness, and both extravagance and wastefulness are prohibited; as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): {And eat and drink, but be not excessive. Indeed, He likes not those who commit excess.} (Al-A`raf: 31)\nAnd He dispraised wastefulness, saying (interpretation of the meaning): {And give the relative his right, and [also] the poor and the traveler, and do not spend wastefully. Indeed, the wasteful are brothers of the devils, and ever has Satan been to his Lord ungrateful.} (Al-Isra\': 26),\nEven if you adhere to a dose that does not cause harm and do not spend a lot of money on it, there is still a fear of becoming addicted to it. Therefore, the advice is to stay away from it, and in the permissible good things, there is sufficiency.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/455054/using-nicotine-gumnicotine-lip-pouch-if-one-does-not-smoke-or-vape
47693,"I suffer from a lot of discharge, and most of what is discharged is semen (fluid usually emitted at the point of climax) which may or may not be accompanied by feelings of desire, but semen is discharged several times a day, and I do Ghusl each time.","['Praise be to Allah.Please note that if the discharge of semen is accompanied by feelings of desire, Ghusl is required according to scholarly consensus. (See Al-Majmu`, 2/111; Al-Mughni, 1/266)\nWith regard to semen being discharged without desire, the scholars differed concerning that. The most correct view is that if it is emitted without desire, Ghusl is not required but you have to do Wudu.\xa0\nThe evidence for that is the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to `Ali ibn Abu Talib (may Allah be pleased with him): “If water gushes forth then Ghusl is required.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 206; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Al-Irwa’, 125. See also Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti’, 1/278) “Gushes forth” means that it comes out forcefully, with feelings of desire.\xa0\nOne has to distinguish between the kinds of discharge that come out; not every discharge that comes out of the private part is semen for which Ghusl is required . There is Wadiy (a fluid emitted after urination), semen (fluid emitted at the point of climax) and various discharges experienced by women.\xa0\nYou have to know the difference between these and be able to distinguish between them. Madhiy and Wadiy do not necessitate Ghusl, rather what is required is to wash the private parts with water and do Wudu.\xa0\nIt is proven that `Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I was a man who used to emit a great deal of Madhiy, so I told Al-Miqdad ibn Al-Aswad to ask the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about that. He asked him and he said: `Wudu is required for that.’” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 132; Muslim, 303)\xa0\nThese discharges are not impure, but they break Wudu\nIf the emission of semen is accompanied by feelings of desire , then Ghusl is required. If it is not accompanied by feelings of desire then Ghusl is not required.\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“The difference between semen and Madhiy is that semen is thick and has a smell, and it comes out in gushes when desire intensifies. Madhiy is a thin liquid that has no smell, and it does not gush out or come out when desire intensifies, rather it comes when desire has calmed down.\xa0\nWadiy is a liquid that comes out after urinating, a few white drops that appear at the end of urination.\nThis is a description of these three things.\xa0\nWith regard to the rulings on them, Wadiy is subject to the same rulings as urine, in all aspects.\xa0\nMadhiy is somewhat different to urine with regard to purification, because it is less impure, so it is sufficient to sprinkle water on it. So one should put water on the area (of the clothes) affected, without squeezing it or rubbing it. Similarly a man should wash his entire penis and testicles even if no Madhiy got on them.\xa0\nSemen is pure and there is no need to wash what it gets onto, unless that is to remove any marks or traces, but it necessitates Ghusl . Madhiy, Wadiy and urine, on the other hand, necessitate Wudu.” (Majmu` Fatawa Ibn `Uthyamin, 11/169)\xa0\nIt seems that your situation is that of a person who is sick, so you should refer to a doctor or specialist. We ask Allah to grant you a way out from every difficulty, for He is All-Hearing, Ever Responsive.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/47693/is-ghusl-required-if-semen-is-emitted-without-desire
406460,1. Is it kufr to throw a paper on which the name of the mother of ‘Issa is written?,"['Praise be to Allah.\nFirstly:\nIt is prohibited to throw a paper containing the name of a prophet from the prophets into impurity, or to throw it in a manner of insult and belittlement in other than impurity, and this act is considered disbelief.\nIt is stated in ""Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah"" (14/59): ""It is obligatory to protect the books of exegesis, Hadith, and Islamic sciences from being treated with disrespect.\nWhoever throws a paper containing something from Islamic knowledge, or containing the Name of Allah, or the name of a prophet, or an angel into impurity, or smears it with impurity - even if it is overlooked (a small quantity) - is judged as a disbeliever, if it is proven that he intended to insult the Shari`ah.""\nSecondly:\nIt is prohibited to show disrespect (to the name) if the intention is to refer to the prophet by\xa0the name, such as by accompanying it with ""peace be upon him,"" or if the context of the speech indicates that intention.\nHowever, if the name refers to a person other than the prophet, then it is not prohibited to disrespect it, such as if the person\'s name is `Isa (Jesus) or Muhammad or Ibrahim.\nAd-Dusuqi said: ""Like throwing the Quran, which is apostasy: throwing the Names of Allah, etc., and the names of the prophets, if that is with the intention of belittling and making light of them; by way of throwing them because they are the name of a prophet.\nAnd his saying: \'and the names of the prophets\' means: those accompanied by what indicates that, such as: \'peace and blessings be upon him\'y."" This is the end of the statement from ""Hashiyat Ad-Dusuqi"" (4/301).\nAs-Sawi said: ""His saying: [and the Names of Allah]: meaning: and the names of the prophets if it is with the intention of belittling and making light of them, where they are specified with a description that distinguishes them, like Muhammad the Messenger of Allah, or accompanied by prayer."" This is the end of the statement from ""Hashiyat As-Sawi on Ash-Sharh As-Saghir"" (4/433).\nTherefore, it is not prohibited to throw away a paper which has Christian or Christopher written on it - if it means Christian - because this has become a name for the person belonging to Christianity, not meant to mention the name of `Isa (Jesus) peace be upon him.\nThirdly:\nAs for Maryam, she is not a prophet, so it is disliked to throw papers with her name on them, as it is disliked to throw the names of the Companions, and it is prohibited if it is with the intention of disrespect.\nIbn Al-Hajj Al-Maliki, (may Allah have mercy on him)\xa0said: ""It is common among some craftsmen in this time that they use paper without knowing what is in it.\nAnd this is not permissible; because it may contain the Noble Quran, or a Hadith of the Prophet\'name (peace and blessings be upon him)\xa0or a name from the names of the angels or the prophets (peace be upon them).\nWhatever is of that nature, it is not permissible to use it, nor to disrespect it; out of sanctity for it and reverence for its status.\nIf it (paper) contains the names of scholars or the righteous predecessors - may Allah be pleased with them - or the Islamic sciences, then it is disliked, and it does not reach the level of prohibition like the one before it.""\nThis is the end of the statement from ""Al-Madkhal"" (4/89).\nWe asked our Sheikh Abdul Rahman Al-Barrak (may Allah preserve him)\xa0about throwing papers in the trash while they contain the name of a Companion\xa0and he said: ""If the intention is not to insult: then it is not prohibited.""

220647,"I heard that Allah, may He be Exalted, divided Ramadan into three parts: the first ten days of it are mercy, the second ten days are forgiveness and the third ten days are ransom from the fire. It is said that there are specific aDu`asfor each part, so in the first part we say: Allahumm arhamni ya arham ar-rahimeen (O Allah, have mercy on me, O most merciful of those who show mercy); in the second part we say Allahumm ighfir li ya Rabb Al-`Alameen (O Allah forgive me, O Lord of the Worlds); and in the third part we say Allahumm a`tiqni min an-nar wa adkhilni Al-Jannah (O Allah, ransom me from the Fire and admit me to Paradise). Is this correct and is there any evidence for it? What are the Du`a`s that should be recited a great deal in Ramadan? To the best of my knowledge, Allahumma innaka `afuwwun tuhibb Al-`afwa fa`affu `anni (O Allah, You are forgiving and You love forgiveness, so forgive me) is one of the Du`a`s that should be repeated often in the last ten days, when seeking Laylat Al-Qadr. What about the other days of Ramadan? Are there any specific Du`a`s for them?","['Praise be to Allah.Is Ramadan divided into three parts?\nIbn Khuzaymah (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated in his Sahih (1887) that Salman (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) addressed us on the last day of Sha`ban and said: “O people, a great month has come upon you, a blessed month… It is a month the beginning of which is mercy, its middle is forgiveness and its end is ransom from the Fire.”\xa0\nIn the answer to question no.\xa021364 , we explained that this Hadith isinauthentic. \xa0\nThe entire month of Ramadan is mercy from Allah; the entire month is also forgiveness and ransom from the Fire. None of these blessings is restricted to any one part of the month to the exclusion of any other part, and this is a reflection of the vastness of Allah`s mercy.\xa0\nMuslim (1079) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When Ramadan comes, the gates of Paradise are opened and the gates of Hell are closed, and the devils are fettered.”\xa0\nAt-Tirmidhi (682) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When the first night of Ramadan comes, the devils and mischievous jinn are chained up, and the gates of Hell are closed, and none of its gates are opened. The gates of Paradise are opened and none of its gates are closed. And a caller cries out: `O seeker of good, proceed; O seeker of evil, desist.` And Allah has people whom He frees (from the Fire), and that happens every day.” (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Tirmidhi)\xa0\nBased on that, singling out the first third of Ramadan to pray for mercy , the second third to pray for forgiveness and the last third to pray for ransom from Hell is an innovation for which there is no basis in Islamic teachings. There is also no justification for singling out these times for these supplications, because all the days of Ramadan are equal in that regard. Rather the Muslim may pray for whatever he wants of goodness in this world and the hereafter throughout Ramadan; that includes asking Allah for mercy, forgiveness, ransom from the Fire and admission to Paradise.\xa0\nThe recommendation to make a lot of Du`a in Ramadan\nThe Muslim should offer a great deal of Du`a, asking for goodness and mercy, especially in this month, making the most of this time of goodness and blessing (Barakah), seeking the mercy and forgiveness of their Lord, may He be Exalted. Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And when My slaves ask you (O Muhammad blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) concerning Me, then (answer them), I am indeed near (to them by My Knowledge). I respond to the invocations of the supplicant when he calls on Me (without any mediator or intercessor). So let them obey Me and believe in Me, so that they may be led aright.”\xa0[Al-Baqarah 2:186]\xa0\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“The fact that Allah, may He be Exalted, mentions this verse, which encourages one to offer Du`a, in the midst of the verses that speak of the rulings on fasting, indicates that one should strive hard in offering Du`a at the end of the fast and, indeed, every time one breaks the fast.”\xa0(Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 1/509)\xa0\nExamples of Du`as in Ramadan\nIt is good for the one who offers Du`a to follow proper etiquette and to recite many of the Du`as that have been narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and not to overstep the mark in offering Du`a. He should observe the etiquette of Du`a and recite often the Du`as that it is recommended to recite a great deal in Ramadan and also at times other than Ramadan. These include the following:\xa0\n\n\xa0“Rabbana atina fi`d-dunya hasanah wa fi`l-akhirah hasanah wa qina `adhab An-nar (Our Lord, give us that which is good in this world and that which is good in the Hereafter, and protect us from the torment of the Fire),” [Al-Baqarah 2:201]\n“Rabbana hab lana min azwajina wa dhurriyyatina qurrata a`yunin waj`alna lil-muttaqina imama (Our Lord! Bestow on us from our wives and our offspring who will be the comfort of our eyes, and make us leaders for the Muttaqun (the pious))” [Al-Furqan 25:74].\n“Rabb ij`alni muqima as-salati wa min dhurriyyati Rabbana wa taqabbal Du`a. Rabbana ighfir li wa li walidayya wa lil-mu`minina yawma yaqum ul-hisab (O my Lord! Make me one who performs As-Salat (Iqamat-as-Salat), and (also) from my offspring, our Lord! And accept my invocation. Our Lord! Forgive me and my parents, and (all) the believers on the Day when the reckoning will be established).” [Ibrahim 14:40-41]\nAllahumma innaka `afuwwun tuhibb Al-`afwa fa`affu `anni (O Allah, You are forgiving and You love forgiveness, so forgive me).\nAllahumma inni as`aluka min Al-khayri kullihi `ajilihi wa ajilihi, ma `alimtu minhu wa ma lam a`lam, wa a`udhu bika min ash-sharri kullihi `ajilihi wa ajilihi, ma `alimtu minhu wa ma lam a`lam.

153791,"Is it acceptable to do Wudu without rinsing the mouth and nose, because the Quranic verse does not go into details; rather it speaks of generalities, i.e., washing the face?","['Praise be to Allah.The scholars differed concerning the ruling on rinsing the mouth and nose in Wudu and ghusl . The correct scholarly view is that these actions are obligatory, and Wudu or ghusl is not valid without them, because they are included in washing the face which is enjoined in the Quranic verse.\xa0\nAl-Hajjawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Az-Zad, in Bab Furud Al-Wudu wa Sifatuhu (The obligatory parts of Wudu and its description), p. 29:\xa0\n“The obligatory parts (of Wudu) are six: Washing the face – of which the mouth and nose are part; washing the hands; wiping the head – of which the ears are part; washing the feet up to the ankles; doing these actions in order; and doing them continuously , without interruption , which means not delaying the washing of one part until the part before it has dried.”\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Ash-Sharh:\xa0\n“The words “of which the mouth and nose are part” mean they are part of the face, because they are located on the face, so they are included with it. Based on this, rinsing the mouth and nose are among the obligatory parts of Wudu, but they are not separate (rather they are included with the face). This is similar to the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “I have been commanded to prostrate on seven bones: the forehead – and he pointed to his nose…” (Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti‘, 1/119)\xa0\nThe scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas said:\xa0\n“Rinsing the mouth and nose in Wudu is proven from the actions and words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and they are included in washing the face. So Wudu is not valid if they are omitted or if one of them is omitted.” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 4/78) (See also Al-Mughni by Ibn Qudamah, 1/83)\xa0\nThe fact that the verse does not explicitly mention rinsing the mouth and nose does not mean that they are not obligatory, because the Sunnah explains the Quran, and the Sunnah teaches us that we should rinse the mouth and nose. It is not narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that he omitted one or both of them in Wudu. This is an explanation of the command mentioned in the Quran to wash the face when purifying oneself.\xa0\nSo if a person omits rinsing the mouth and nose when purifying himself, his purification is not valid, whether he did that deliberately or by mistake.\xa0\nThe scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas said:\xa0\n“If a person forgets to wash any of the parts of the body that should be washed when doing Wudu, or he omits any portion of that, even if it is small, if it was during Wudu or immediately afterwards and the traces of water are still on his limbs and have not dried yet, then he should wash the part that he forgot and those that come after it only. But if he remembers that he forgot to wash one of the parts of the body that are to be washed in Wudu, or a portion of it, after his limbs have dried or during the prayer or after finishing the prayer, then he has to do Wudu all over again, just as Allah has prescribed repeating the prayer in full. Allah has enjoined washing all the parts of the body that are to be washed in Wudu, so if a person omits part of that, even if it is a small area on one of the parts that are to be washed in Wudu, it is as if he forgot to wash all of it. This is what is indicated in the report narrated by `Umar ibn Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) saw a man doing Wudu, and he omitted a spot the size of a fingernail on his foot. He told him to repeat his Wudu and his prayer, and he went back and prayed again.
