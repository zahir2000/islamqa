256212,Is one sinful for not attending the `Eid sermon? And what is the evidence for that?,"['Praise be to Allah.The `Eid sermon is a recommended Sunnah, so its attendance and listening to it are not mandatory.\nThere is no harm for one who has prayed `Eid to leave and not sit for the sermon, and the evidence for this is what Abu Dawud (1155) narrated from `Abdullah ibn As-Sa\'ib, who said: ""I witnessed `Eid with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him), and when he finished the prayer, he said: \'We will give a sermon, so whoever wishes to sit for the sermon may sit, and whoever wishes to leave may leave.\' There is a difference of opinion regarding the connectedness and interruption of this Hadith. A number of Imams, such as Imam Ahmad, Ibn Ma\'in, Abu Dawud, and Abu Zur`ah Ar-Razi opted for the opinion that it is mursal (interrupted). Refer to: \'Al-Musnad Al-Musannaf Al-Mu`allal\' (11/275).\nHowever, the majority of scholars act according to its implications.\nAs-San`ani (may Allah have mercy on him) said in ""Subul As-Salam"" (3/184): ""Consensus has been transmitted on the non-obligation of the sermon in the two `Eids."" End quote.\nAsh-Shawkani (may Allah have mercy on him) said in ""Nayl Al-Awtar"" (3/376): ""Those who obligate the `Eid prayer and others have agreed on the non-obligation of its sermon, and I do not know of anyone who says it is obligatory."" End quote.\nTherefore, the non-obligation of attending the `Eid sermon is agreed upon among the majority of scholars, and here are some statements of scholars from the four jurisprudential schools confirming this ruling:\nAt-Tahawi Al-Hanafi said in ""Bayan Mushkil Al-Athar"" (9/359) after mentioning the aforementioned Hadith:\n""We understand from this Hadith that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) allowed those who prayed with him to leave before attending his sermon after it (i.e., the prayer). The sermon for `Eid is not like the sermon for Jumu`ah, in terms of sitting for it, listening to it, and refraining from idle talk until it is finished; this is permissible in the `Eid sermon and prohibited in the Jumu`ah sermon."" End quote.\nAl-Hattab Al-Maliki said in ""Mawahib Al-Jalil"" (2/232): ""Listening to the two sermons is recommended."" End quote.\nIn ""Hashiyat Al-`Adawi"" (3/206): ""The ruling of the sermon: It is recommended, as mentioned in the verification."" End quote.\nIbn Al-Hajj said in ""Al-Madkhal"" (2/284): ""The Sunnah is not to leave after the prayer [i.e., `Eid] until the Imam finishes his sermon."" End quote.\nAn-Nawawi Ash-Shafi`i said in ""Al-Majmu`"" (5/29): ""It is recommended for people to listen to the sermon, and neither the sermon nor listening to it is a condition for the validity of the `Eid prayer. However, Ash-Shafi`i said: If one leaves listening to the sermon of `Eid, or the eclipse, or the prayer for rain, or the sermons of Hajj, or speaks during it, or leaves and abandons it, it is disliked, but there is no repetition required for him."" End quote.\nIbn Qudamah Al-Maqdisi said: ""The two sermons are a Sunnah, and their attendance and listening to them are not obligatory... They were placed after the prayer, and Allah knows best, because since they are not obligatory, they were set at a time when those who wish to leave can do so, unlike the Jumu`ah sermon."" End quote from ""Al-Mughni"" (3/279).\nAl-Mardawi Al-Hanbali (may Allah have mercy on him) said in ""Al-Insaf"" (5/357):\n""The two sermons are a Sunnah, this is the doctrine without doubt, and most of the companions [scholars] are upon it."" End quote.\nThe scholars of the Permanent Committee for Islamic Research and Issuing Fatwas said:\n""The two sermons of `Eid are a Sunnah, and they are after the `Eid prayer."" End quote from ""Islamic Fatawa"" (1/425).\nSheikh Ibn `Uthaymin said: ""The Jumu`ah sermon requires attendance because of the verse of Allah (interpretation of the meaning): {O you who have believed, when [the adhan] is called for the prayer on the day of Jumu`ah [Friday], then proceed to the remembrance of Allah and leave trade.} As for the two `Eid sermons, attendance is not obligatory; rather, a person may leave immediately after the prayer, but it is better to stay.""

302320,"I love my husband very much. But when I think of all the times we have argued, I feel sad because I wonder if we are still husband and wife. He has said things like “You can go back to your dad’s house and be miserable again.” He said it was not a Divorce. But how can we be so sure if he used the word ‘again’?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe husband\'s statement, ""You can return to your father\'s house and be miserable again,"" his statement, ""If there is violence, it will be the end,"" and his statement, ""I\'m done""... all of these are implicit expressions, and they are not explicit in divorce.\nDivorce does not occur with implicit expressions without intention.\nSo, if your husband says that he did not intend divorce, then divorce does not take place.\nIn the Encyclopedia of Jurisprudence (35/138): ""These implicit expressions and the like may be understood as referring to divorce or may be understood otherwise. The intended meaning is concealed from the listener, and thus they require intention to specify the intended meaning. So his saying: \'You are ba\'in (separate, revocable),\' can mean separation from evil or good or marriage, and \'free\': can mean free from the husband, and marriage, and can mean free from diseases or defects, and \'I have parted from you\': can mean separation from marriage, and can mean separation from the bed or place, and his saying: \'You are innocent (free),\' can mean innocence from marriage, and can mean innocence from evil or good, and his saying: \'Battah (Absolutely),\' from the word meaning \'cutting off,\' can mean cutting off from marriage and can mean cutting off from evil, and his saying: \'Your matter is in your hands,\' can mean divorce, and can mean something else, and so on.\nThere is no disagreement among the majority of Jurists that divorce occurs with implied statements if there is intention.\nThey differed in some issues of implicit divorce...\nThe Shafi`i school of thought holds that divorce occurs with implicit statements if there is intention and does not occur without intention.\nThere are many such expressions, indeed they are innumerable: like \'You are free,\' \'innocent,\' \'absolutely,\' \'separate,\' \'observe your waiting period,\' \'purify your womb,\' \'join your family,\' \'your rope on your own neck,\' \'remain single,\' \'go away,\' \'leave me,\' \'farewell.\'\nThey said: Implicit refers to what can mean divorce and other things, but with the intention to enact it, and with the intention of its words.\nAs for expressions that do not imply divorce except on an unreasonable basis, they have no effect, so no divorce occurs with them even if intended, such as saying: \'May Allah bless you,\' and \'May Allah reward you well.\' End quote.\nSecondly:\nYour husband\'s statement, ""If there is violence, it will be the end"":\nIf he meant divorce when he said it, then this is a divorce contingent on a condition, so if the intended violence occurs, a divorce takes place.\nAnd if he did not mean divorce when he said it—as understood from your question that he first answered you that he did not mean divorce—then divorce does not take place. Even if he intended afterwards that you would be divorced if violence occurred, divorce would not occur, unless he uttered the sentence again intending divorce.\nYou should seek mediation from knowledgeable people who can sit with your husband and make him understand the seriousness of divorce and its rulings; so that he is cautious about being negligent in this matter.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/302320/implicit-divorce
406878,"Referring to Fatwa number: (222445 ), I gave a sum of money as expiation for delaying the fasting to one of my relatives, and it was a sum of money equivalent to the value of providing rice; since it was difficult for me to bring him rice due to special circumstances, so as not to cause him embarrassment among his brothers and children, with my recommendation to him that he should buy rice with this amount. My question is: Is what I did permissible or not?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nWhoever breaks their fast in Ramadan due to a valid reason, such as menstruation or an illness that is expected to be cured, must make up for the days they missed before the next Ramadan enters.\nIf they delay making up the fasts until the next Ramadan arrives, many Jurists hold the view that in addition to making up the fasts, they must also feed a poor person for each day missed. Others opine that feeding the poor is recommended, not mandatory, and that the obligatory act is only to make up the fasts. Please refer to question no: (26865 ).\nSecondly:\nIt is permissible for one who wishes to feed a poor person to give them money and authorize them to buy food with it, and once the food is purchased, to take possession of it.\nThe Jurists have mentioned the reverse of this scenario and have ruled its permissibility, which is that the poor person authorizes the wealthy to take possession of the Zakat money on their behalf, and by doing so, the Zakat reaches the poor person and remains with the wealthy as a trust.\nThe scholar Ibn Qasim (may Allah have mercy on him) said in ""Hashiyat Ar-Rawd"" (3/293): ""If the poor person authorizes the owner of the wealth to take possession on their behalf, and to buy with it thereafter a garment or the like, it is valid.""

441733,Why are there paintings of some Muslim scholars despite it being haram?,"['Praise be to Allah.(1) We have previously explained in the answer to question number (344172) the ruling on photography and the making of statues, the prohibition by the majority and the permission by some Jurists for a limited type of them, and the most correct view in this matter, so please refer to it.\n(2) It is a well-established fact among specialists that Islamic civilization is more a civilization of the word than a civilization of the image; for this reason, most aspects of Islamic art are related to architecture, calligraphy, and ornamentation, and very little of it has taken the direction of painting and sculpture. Some historians have even stated that the Byzantine Church\'s prohibition of images and statues was influenced by Islam.\nDr. `Abdul Mun`im Majid says in his book ""The Political History of the Arab State - The Era of the Umayyad Caliphs"" (p. 34): ""The doctrine of the Byzantine state itself will be influenced by the call of Islam to prohibit the worship of images.""\n(3) The foregoing does not prevent the existence of drawing and sculpted images, but this was minimal compared to the other manifestations of artistic civilization previously mentioned. This small amount goes back to the environment of palaces and rulers and kings in the Umayyad state, increased slightly in the Abbasid state, and then most of it spread during the Fatimid era and those influenced by them from the Mamluks. This is not surprising for the Fatimids, who deviated from the Shari`ah in the fundamentals of belief, and spread various types of superstitions and polytheistic idolatries, which suited them to spread imagery and statues and other matters prohibited by the Shari`ah to block the means to polytheism and the glorification of the dead.\nDr. Salamah Muhammad `Ali says in his research ""Carving Living Elements in Islamic Art"": ""The Arab spirit was averse to those Western forms and styles that were imported in the form of statues and images printed on fabrics and curtains, which were done by traders coming from the Levant and Yemen, and those countries were polytheistic with multiple gods...\nAnd the Dislike of representing living creatures in Islamic art was a desire to distance from polytheistic manifestations.""\n(4) It is clear from the above that the legal and moral reality of Islam was the prohibition of statues and images, and that deviation from this reality occurred in the environment of rulers where types of deviation from the laws of Islam occurred, even exceeding the issue of images and statues.\nArtists who engaged in photography and sculpture were sponsored by the state, and as far as we know, it has not been proven that any of the scholars of Shari`ah, Jurisprudence, and Tafsir worked in the industry of images and statues, as understood from the formulation of the question. If it did occur, it might have been from those who permitted this matter, not as a practice that one of the majority of scholars who prohibited it engaged in.\nThe occurrence of shar`i violations by some rulers or in some social circles is understandable, as humans are not infallible from sins and mistakes. Muslims obey and disobey, but Islam itself, in its theories, rulings, and values, forbids these violations, and none of the Muslim scholars have systematically and methodically involved themselves in them; otherwise, where is this jurisprudential heritage that establishes these practices or acknowledges them?!\nIf someone has portrayed a scholar from the Muslim scholars, then the one who did it bears the responsibility, whether in the past or present, and there is no sin on the scholar for that, nor does it necessarily mean that he approves of it.\n\xa0And Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/441733/presence-of-paintaings-of-some-muslim-scholars
