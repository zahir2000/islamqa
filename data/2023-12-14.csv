467630,"I am an agricultural engineer in the animal reproduction department. For a while I have been working in the field of artificial insemination for animals (cattle, buffalo), and also importing animal sperm for some engineers and veterinarians who work in the same field.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt is permissible to sell the semen of animals whose meat may be eaten, for the purpose of insemination, because it is pure (tahir) according to the correct view, and has beneficial uses, and it is possible to deliver it. Therefore it is a product which has value, so it is permissible to sell it like anything else that it is permissible to sell.\nShaykh ‘Abd al-Rahman al-Jibrin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: As for selling the semen to horse owners, that may be permissible if it is beneficial and gives results, and the aim is to increase the number of high quality horses. But the value of it should be within normal limits, without going to extremes in raising the value of this semen, because it does not cost its owners much, and they do not lose anything if it is wasted. End quote from the shaykh’s website.\nShaykh Muhammad al-Mukhtar al-Shinqiti said: With regard to the words “its semen and human semen”, what is meant by “its semen” is the semen of animals whose meat may be eaten; it is regarded as pure (tahir). Here the author is speaking about animal semen, because there are many different rulings regarding semen.\nFor example, animal semen may be sold, and this is applicable to different types of animals. It is well established according to Islamic teachings, and this is the view of almost all the scholars except the Hanafis, that it is not permissible to sell that which is impure (najis), because of the hadith of Jabir ibn ‘Abdillah: “Allah and His Messenger forbade the selling of dead meat [meat of an animal that was not slaughtered in the prescribed manner], alcohol, pork and idols.”\xa0 As it is proven that it is not permissible to sell what is impure, and it has been established that the semen that is emitted by an animal whose meat may be eaten is pure, then in this case, if someone were to ask you about selling the semen of animals, which is sold in syringes and injected into the females so that they will conceive and produce young, and whether it is permissible or not,\nthen according to the view that what comes out of an animal is impure, it is not permissible to sell it, because it is not permissible to sell what is impure. But according to the view that it is pure, it is permissible to sell it, because it is pure like any other pure item.""(Sharh Zad al-Mustaqni‘\xa0 23/10).\nWith regard to the prohibition on stud fees – which means that it is not allowed to charge a fee for an animal mating with another and ejaculating – the jurists gave as a reason for that the fact that the nature and quantity of the water (semen) is not known, and it cannot be delivered; the matter depends on the animal’s desire and ejaculation.\nBased on that, there is nothing wrong with you buying animal semen, then selling it.\nSecondly:\nArtificial insemination is a reproductive technology that is used to inseminate female animals using semen that has been extracted by mechanical means from male animals of good pedigree and high productivity. This is inserted into the female reproductive tract, after artificially inducing ovulation in the female by mechanical, hormonal or other means.\nAfter the sperm is obtained, it goes through several stages, including freezing in order to obtain what is known as an insemination straw, which is placed in a nitrogen solution at minus 96°C, so as to preserve it when it is moved from one place to another.\nWhen the straw is taken out for use, it is placed in hot water to prepare it for insertion in the uterus, using a specially designed syringe.\nThere is nothing wrong with artificially inseminating animals, even if that is done for a fee, and it does not come under the prohibition on stud fees.\nIn the answer to question no. 202324 , we explained that this artificial insemination does not come under the heading of stud fees, which are prohibited. Please see that question for more details.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/467630/ruling-on-selling-animal-sperm-for-the-purpose-of-artificial-insemination
194080,"Is hunting allowed in Islam? And under what conditions? Hunting is illegal in my country of living, so please tell me if I hunt secretly, is it allowed in Islam or not?","['Praise be to Allah.Is hunting prohibited in Islam?\nThe basic principle concerning hunting land game is that it is permissible, except for one who is in a state of Ihram for Hajj or `Umrah, or is within the boundaries of the Haram zone even if he is not in Ihram.\xa0\nWith regard to fishing and catching other kinds of seafood , it is permissible for the one who is in Ihram and others alike.\xa0\nWhoever hunts permissible animals in order to benefit from them by selling them to earn money, or eating them, giving them as gifts, and so on, there is nothing wrong with that according to scholarly consensus.\xa0\nThe rulings on hunting have to do with the hunter, the prey, and the “tools” used. We will explain this matter in brief.\xa0\nConditions pertaining to the hunter\xa0\nWith regard to the stipulations required of the hunter for his hunting to be acceptable, they are as follows:\xa0\n\nHe should be of sound mind and have reached the age of discernment. This is the view of the majority of jurists (Hanafis, Maalikis and Hanbalis, and it is one view among the Shafi`is).\n\nThat is because a minor who has not reached the age of discernment is not qualified to slaughter an animal, in their view, (and if he does that, it is not regarded as acceptable and the meat is not permissible); by the same token, he is not qualified to hunt. Moreover, hunting requires the intention and invoking the name of Allah, which are not valid if done by one who is not of sound mind, as was explained by the Hanafis and Hanbalis.\xa0\n\nHe should not be in Ihram. If he is in Ihram for Hajj or ‘Umrah, then any game caught by him is not to be eaten; rather it is regarded as “dead meat” (i.e., meat from an animal that was not slaughtered in the prescribed manner).\nIt should be permissible to eat meat slaughtered by him – i.e., he should be a Muslim or one of the People of the Book (Jewish or Christian). It is not permissible to eat game hunted by a polytheist, Magian (Zoroastrian), communist, atheist, apostate and the like.\n\nBased on that, it is not permissible to eat game hunted by one who does not pray altogether , and it is not permissible to eat meat slaughtered by him, because he is a disbeliever and apostate.\n\nIt is stipulated that the hunter must invoke the name of Allah, may He be Exalted, when releasing his hunting animal or shooting. That is according to the majority of Hanafi, Maaliki and Hanbali jurists.\nIt is stipulated that the hunter should intend by releasing his hunting animal or shooting to catch that which it is permissible to hunt. If he releases an arrow or hunting animal against a human being or tame animal, it is not permissible.\n\nConditions pertaining to the prey\nWith regard to the stipulations on the prey, it should be an animal whose flesh may be eaten, i.e., it should be permissible to eat. This is the view of all the jurists, if the hunt is for the purpose of eating.\xa0\nWith regard to hunting in general terms, they differed concerning it.\xa0\nThe Hanafis and Maalikis are of the view that there is no stipulation that the prey should be an animal whose flesh may be eaten; rather in their view it is permissible to hunt both animals whose flesh may be eaten and those whose flesh may not be eaten, for the purpose of obtaining its skin, hair or feathers, or to ward off its evil (i.e., if it is posing a danger to people).\xa0\nWith regard to the Shafi`is and Hanbalis, they do not regard it as permissible to hunt or slaughter any animal whose flesh may not be eaten.\xa0\n\nThe prey should be a wild animal that is too difficult to capture because it runs very fast or flies away. What is meant by wild is one that is wild by nature and cannot be caught except by means of tricks. As for tame or domesticated animals that have owners, it is not permissible to hunt them.\nIt should not be one of the game animals of the Haram zone. The jurists unanimously agreed that it is prohibited to hunt in the Haram zone any land animals – i.e., those that reproduce on land – regardless of whether their flesh may be eaten or not.\nThe animal should not disappear from the hunter’s view for a long time if he does not go and look for it. If the prey disappears from his view, and he does not go and look for it, then it cannot be eaten. But if it does not disappear, or it disappears but he does not fail to go and look for it, it may be eaten. This is a point on which the jurists agree in general.\nIf he shoots at the prey and part of its body is severed from it, but the animal is still alive, it is prohibited to eat the severed part. There is no difference of opinion among the jurists concerning that, because of the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “Whatever is cut from an animal when it is alive is (considered as) dead meat.” (Narrated by Abu Dawood, 2858; classed as authentic by Al-Albaani in Saheeh Abu Dawood)\n\nIf it is still alive, it must be slaughtered in the prescribed manner or else it too is prohibited, according to scholarly consensus.\nWith regard to sea animals, none of these conditions are stipulated with regard to them.\xa0\nAccording to the majority of jurists (Maalikis and Hanbalis; it is also the more correct view among the Shafi`is), it is permissible to catch and eat all sea animals, whether they are fish or otherwise, because of the words of Allah, may He be exalted (interpretation of the meaning): “Lawful to you is (the pursuit of) water game and its use for food” [Al-Ma’idah 5:96], i.e., hunting or catching it.\xa0\nTherefore, all sea creatures that live only in water are permissible, whether they are caught alive or dead.\nConditions pertaining to the tools of hunting\nWith regard to the “tools” used for hunting, they are of two types: inanimate or animate.\xa0\n\nInanimate “tools”\n\n\nIt is stipulated that the tool should be sharp so that it can pierce or cut the flesh, otherwise the meat is not permissible unless the animal is slaughtered in the prescribed manner.\n\nIt is not stipulated that the tool should be made of metal; rather it is acceptable to hunt with any sharp tool, whether it is made of metal or hard wood or stone that has been sharpened to a point, or similar materials that may pierce the body.\xa0\n\nIt is stipulated that the sharp edge should strike the prey and wound it, and it should be possible to ascertain that death was caused by this wounding, otherwise it is not permissible to eat it, because that which is killed by the blunt edge of the tool or its weight is regarded as having been killed by a violent blow, and is not permissible.\nIt is permissible to hunt with bullets ; whatever is shot with bullets , such as birds, rabbits and gazelles, and the name of Allah was invoked over it at the moment of opening fire, is permissible and may be eaten, even if it is found dead.\nThe jurists are of the view that it is not permissible to hunt with poisoned arrows if it is certain or thought most likely that the poison will help to kill the prey or that is possible, because two factors – one permissible and one prohibited – are combined in its killing, therefore the prohibited factor is deemed to take precedence. The same applies if both a Magian and a Muslim shoot arrows to kill the animal.\xa0\n\nHowever, if it is not possible (that the poison could kill the animal), then it is not prohibited to eat it.\n\nAnimate “tools”\n\nIt is permissible to hunt with trained animals, such as dogs, or other carnivores and birds which have fangs and talons, respectively. Trained dogs, lynxes, tigers, lions, falcons and other trained hunting-animals, such as various types of falcons, hawks and eagles are all the same in that regard.\xa0\nThe basic principle is that in general terms it is permissible to hunt with anything that may be taught and trained.\xa0\nConditions pertaining to the hunting animals\nWith regard to hunting-animals, the following conditions are stipulated:\n\nThe animal should be trained, according to the consensus of the jurists, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And those beasts and birds of prey which you have trained…” [Al-Ma’idah 5:4].\xa0\nThe animal should wound the prey in any part of its body, according to the Maalikis and Hanbalis; this is also the apparent meaning of the report and fatwas of the Hanafis, in contrast to the view of the Shafi`is. If the hunting animal kills it by a blow or bites it without causing a wound, it is not permissible, as in the case of an arrow if it kills it with its blunt edge or weight. The same applies if the hunter releases the dog and it catches the prey and breaks its neck, but does not wound it, or it jumps on its chest and suffocates it.\nThe hunting-animal should be released by a Muslim or a person from the People of the Book (Jewish or Christian), along with invocation of the name of Allah. If it goes forward by itself or runs away from its master, or he forgets to invoke the name of Allah when releasing it, then it catches some prey and kills it, it is not to be eaten. This is in general terms.\nThe animal should not be distracted by something else after it is released, so that the catch will be a direct result of it being released. This condition is stated by the Hanafis and Maalikis.\nThe jurists unanimously agreed that if one whose catch is permissible, such as a Muslim or Christian, hunts in partnership with one whose catch is not permissible, such as a Magian or idol-worshipper, then whatever they catch is prohibited and cannot be eaten. This is based on the principle that the factor that makes it prohibited takes precedence over the factor that makes it permissible.\n\nBased on that, if a Magian works with a Muslim, such as if they both shoot the prey or they both release a hunting animal to catch it, what is caught is prohibited, because both permissible and prohibited factors were present in killing it, so we give precedence to the factor that makes it prohibited in this case. (See: Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah, 28/117-142)\xa0\nHunting in violation of local laws\nIf the laws and regulations of the state do not permit hunting and they prohibit it, then it is not permissible to hunt, because that is contrary to the regulations of the state which you entered with a visa and a work contract, so you have to abide by whatever they have stipulated. By admitting you to their country, they only allow you to adhere to its regulations and laws. In most cases, when the state prohibits hunting it is in the public interest, and in that case you must abide by those regulations.\xa0\nEven if we assume that it is not obligatory to abide by those regulations, going against them exposes one to the risk of punishment and perhaps to expulsion from the country. The wise person does not try to do things that may bring harm to him or his family.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/194080/is-hunting-prohibited-in-islam
269845,"If belief in Allah is innate, then why does this Amazonian tribe called Pirahã does not even have basic beliefs in a Creator? Some atheists are using this as an evidence that religious beliefs are not natural to human beings...","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nHumans have an innate knowledge that they have a Creator and Lord. This is one of the clearest proofs for the existence of Allah, may He be exalted.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said:\nThe innate knowledge that Allah exists is stronger than any other evidence for one who has not been misled by the devils. Hence Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{[Adhere to] the natural disposition that Allah instilled in humankind}\xa0[Al-Rum 30:30],\nafter saying: {Adhere exclusively and sincerely to the true faith of monotheism}. So sound human nature testifies to the existence of Allah, and no one can turn away from this innate knowledge except one whom the devils have misled. In the case of one whom the devils have misled, there is a strong reason why this innate knowledge is no longer effective in his case.""(Sharh al-Safariniyyah, p. 31).\nFor information on the evidence for the existence of Allah, may He be exalted, please see the answer to question no. 26745 .\nThe fact that there are people who deny the existence of Allah, may He be exalted, or who associate others with Him, does not mean that they have no innate knowledge of Allah. Rather it means that they have deviated from this innate knowledge, as a result of the devils among humankind and the jinn misleading them, as is mentioned in the hadith qudsi: “I have created all My slaves with the inclination to worship Me alone, but the devils come to them and turn them away from their religion. They forbid to them that which I have permitted to them, and they tell them to associate others with Me for which I have not sent down any authority.” Narrated by Muslim (2865).\nHence the number of these deniers is very few in relation to the total population of the earth; the entire population has innate knowledge that they have a Lord, even if some of them associate others with Him or worship a lord who is not Allah.\nEven if this innate knowledge is undermined by the influence of parents, forefathers, traditions and one’s environment, it often appears at times of hardship, so a man will turn to his Lord even if he has been arguing about His existence!\nThere is an interesting Western proverb which says, “There are no atheists in the trenches [of the battlefield].”\nMany atheists confirm this innate knowledge of Allah and that it is instilled in every soul, even if they do not call it by this name (fitrah).\nFor more information on that, please see the book Shumu‘ al-Nahar by Ustadh ‘Abdullah al-‘Ujayri, p. 31 ff.\nDr al-Bashir ‘Isam says: One of the most famous counterarguments to the evidence of innate knowledge of Allah is the view of some of them, who say that if knowledge of Allah and His existence is instilled in human nature, then why are there people who deny His existence?\nThe answer is: those who affirm the existence of Allah are only those whose human nature is still sound and has not deviated. As for those who were exposed to strong specious arguments, to the point that they uprooted sound human nature from their souls, they will need to study the rational evidence and scientific proof.\nFor sound human nature to be corrupted and changed is not an impossible or far-fetched notion, for a person may grow up in a deviant and misguided environment, so he will be exposed to many deviant ideas that push him away from the straight path.\nIbn Taymiyah said: “Believing in and acknowledging the Creator is something innate and is instilled in the souls of all people, even though some people may be subjected to that which corrupts their sound human nature to the point that they need to reflect deeply on the matter so as to learn again about their Creator.”\nThere is another answer to this question, which is: those who go against their sound human nature and deny the existence of the Creator are very few among humanity throughout history, as noted above.\nMoreover, many of them may deny the existence of Allah outwardly, even though they may inwardly believe in His existence, as Allah, may He be exalted, tells us about Pharaoh and his people and the way in which they reacted to the signs of Allah, may He be glorified. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{They rejected the signs, although in their hearts they were certain that they were true, out of wickedness and arrogance}\xa0[Al-Naml 27:19]. End quote.\nIt says in his article: It is interesting to note that the view that belief in the existence of Allah is instilled in human nature is not something unique to the scholars of Islam; rather it is something that is affirmed by a group of modern philosophers.\nOne of them, for example, is the American philosopher Alvin Plantinga, who insists that faith is something natural, and that belief in the existence of God is like belief in some other basic concepts, such as the belief that others have rational thought like ours, and the belief that our senses are real, and that the whole is greater than the part. End quote.\nSee the rest of his article for further discussion of the idea that there is a great deal of evidence to prove that knowledge of Allah is innate in human beings.\nFinally, we may note that what we have read about the tribe mentioned is that they are very few in number, and that they live a primitive life. We have not come across anything to suggest that they deny the existence of the Creator. There is a difference between a person not being aware of a particular religion, not worshipping Allah in some way or another, and not knowing Allah by His names and attributes, on the one hand, and denying the existence of the Creator, on the other hand.\nSecondly:\nOur advice to you is to seek knowledge and to avoid reading specious arguments that may corrupt your heart and lead you to doubt, unless you are very well versed in knowledge, in which case you may examine specious arguments in order to refute them.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/269845/response-to-the-specious-argument-that-the-existence-of-primitive-tribes-who-do-not-believe-in-god-undermines-the-idea-that-belief-in-the-existence-of-god-is-innate-in-humans
263252,"There is a sick person who, if he stands, he cannot sit down, and if he sits, he cannot stand up. How should he pray? Should he sit throughout the entire prayer, or should he stand throughout the prayer?","['Praise be to Allah.Importance of doing obligatory and pillars parts of the prayer\xa0\nThe basic principle with regard to the pillars and obligatory parts of the prayer is that the worshipper must do whatever he can, and whatever he is not able to do is waived in his case.\nBased on that, if the worshipper is able to start the prayer standing, then this is what he must do, then bow properly if he is able to. If he is not able to do that, then he may lean forward as much as he is able.\nIf he is able to prostrate on the ground, then this is what he must do. If he is not able to prostrate on the ground, then he may sit (on the floor or on a chair), then he may lean forward for prostration.\nIf he is not able to stand up again , then he may complete his prayer sitting , leaning forward for bowing, and prostrating on the ground if he is able to. If he is not able to do that, then he may lean forward for prostration, and make the leaning for prostration lower than the leaning for bowing.\nIn this way, the worshipper will have complied with the words of Allah, may He be exalted (interpretation of the meaning): “So fear Allah as much as you are able”\xa0 [At-Taghabun 64:16], and with the words of the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “If I command you to do anything, do as much of it as you can.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 7288 and Muslim, 1337)\nIn Mukhtasar Khalil, which is a Maliki book, it says: If he is able to do everything, but if he prostrates he cannot get up again , then he should complete a Rak`ah, then remain seated.\nAl-Khurashi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his Sharh (1/298):\xa0\n“That is, if the worshipper is able to do all the pillars of the prayer, namely standing, reciting Fatihah, bowing, prostrating, rising from the two prostrations and sitting, but if he sits he will not be able to get up and stand, then he should do the first Rak`ah standing, and complete the rest of his prayer sitting. This is the view favoured by Al-Lakhmi, At-Tunisi and Ibn Yunus. It was also said that he should offer all of his prayer standing and leaning forward (for bowing and prostration), except the last Rak`ah, in which he should bow and prostrate normally.”\xa0\nCan you pray standing up?\nIf the worshipper is able to stand and lie down, but he is not able to sit, then he may pray standing, leaning forward for bowing and prostrating, and reciting the Tashahhud whilst standing, then saying the Taslim.\nZakariyya Al-Ansari Ash-Shafa`i (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Asna Al-Matalib (1/146):\n“Whoever is able to stand and lie down only, may stand instead of sitting, because standing is like sitting and more, and he should lean forward instead of bowing and prostrating, and recite the Tashahhud whilst standing. He should not lie down.”\xa0\nIn Hashiyat Al-`Ibadi `Ala Tuhfat Al-Muhtaj (2/23) it says:\n“If he is able to stand or to lie down only, i.e., he is not able to sit, then he should stand and that is obligatory, because standing is like sitting and more, and he should lean forward as much as he can whilst standing up for bowing and prostration … and he should recite the Tashahhud and Tasleem whilst standing; he should not lie down.”\xa0\nAl-Khurashi Al-Maliki (may Allah have mercy on him) said (1/297):\n“The one who is unable to do all the pillars of the prayer, except standing, which he is able to do, should do all of his prayer standing, and lean forward more for his prostration than for his bowing.”\xa0\nIf he is not able to stand, then he may pray sitting, and lean forward instead of bowing and prostrating. If he is able to prostrate on the ground, then he must do that.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Mughni (2/570):\n“The scholars unanimously agreed that the one who is not able to stand may pray sitting.”\xa0\nIn Hashiyat Al-Dusuqi (2/475), it says that “the one who is unable to stand may offer the prayer sitting, doing the bowing and prostration from that position.”\xa0\nIf there is a sick person who can either stand for the entire prayer or sit for the entire prayer, then he should pray sitting.\nThis is indicated by the fact that Islamic teaching waives the obligation of standing in some cases, such as in the supererogatory prayers, or when a man who is able to stand prays behind an Imam who is sick and prays sitting; in that case, he should refrain from standing and pray sitting like his Imam.\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Standing is a pillar of the prayer, but it may be waived in any supererogatory prayer, and may be waived in obligatory prayers in some circumstances.” (Sharh Al-`Umdah (4/515)\nIf there is a conflict between standing and sitting, then doing the prayer sitting is what takes precedence, especially when it is possible, when sitting, to do other pillars of the prayer, such as prostrating, sitting between the two prostrations, and sitting to recite the Tashahhud.\xa0\nTherefore, it is more appropriate to pray the entire\xa0 whilst standing.\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 50075 , 180122 , 10352 , and 13406 .\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/263252/cannot-pray-standing-up
