404812,"Ibn Umar reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said, “The False Messiah will come upon this marsh of Marriqanat. Most of those who go out to him will be women, until a man goes back to his wife, his mother, his daughter, his sister, and his aunt to shackle them tightly, fearing they would go out to him.”","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThis hadith was narrated by Imam Ahmad in al-Musnad (9/255) from Muhammad ibn Ishaq, from Muhammad ibn Talhah, from Salim, from Ibn ‘Umar, who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The Dajjal will halt in this saltmarsh in Marr Qanat, and most of those who go out to him will be women, until a man will go back to his wife, and to his mother, his daughter, his sister and his paternal aunt, and put them in shackles, fearing lest they go out to him. Then Allah will give the Muslims the upper hand over him, and they will fight him and fight his followers, until there will be a Jew hiding beneath a tree or a rock, and the rock or tree will say to the Muslim: Here is a Jew beneath me; kill him.”\nThe commentators on al-Musnad said: Its isnad is weak (da‘if). It includes Muhammad ibn Ishaq, who is mudallis (one who narrates from one who met (a narrator) but did not hear it from him), and he narrated reports from others [without stating clearly that he heard the report directly from them]. It was also narrated by at-Tabarani in al-Kabir (13197) via ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Yahya, from Muhammad ibn Salamah, with this isnad. End quote.\nSecondly:\nBut undoubtedly the tribulation of the Dajjal will be the most difficult tribulation for the individual to prepare for, in order to be able to save himself if he lives until his time.\nIt was narrated that ‘Imran ibn Husayn said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “Between the creation of Adam and the onset of the Hour there is no creation that will cause greater turmoil than the Dajjal.” Narrated by Muslim (2946).\nWe have previously discussed a number of texts which describe this tribulation in the answer to question no. 8806 .\nThe way to save oneself from this tribulation is as follows:\nStriving to be steadfast and be mindful of Allah, may He be exalted, by following His commands and heeding His prohibitions. If a person does that, Allah will be with His slave and will protect him from what he dislikes.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And whoever fears Allah - He will make for him a way out.\nAnd will provide for him from where he does not expect. And whoever relies upon Allah - then He is sufficient for him. Indeed, Allah will accomplish His purpose. Allah has already set for everything a [decreed] extent}\xa0[al-Talaq 65:2-3]\n{ Indeed, Allah is with those who fear Him and those who are doers of good}\xa0[an-Nahl 16:128].\nSeeking refuge with Allah from the tribulation of the false messiah the Dajjal, especially in every prayer after the tashahhud.\nAl-Bukhari (1377) and Muslim (588) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When any one of you says the tashahhud, let him seek refuge with Allah from four things. Let him say: O Allah, I seek refuge with You from the punishment of Hell, from the punishment of the grave, from the trials of life and death, and from the evil of the tribulation of the Dajjal.”\nMemorizing the first ten verses of Surat al-Kahf and reciting them against the Dajjal if he meets him.\nImam Muslim (809) narrated from Abu’d-Darda’ that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever memorizes ten verses from the beginning of Soorat al-Kahf will be protected from the tribulation of the Dajjal.”\nMuslim (7560) and Abu Dawud narrated that an-Nawwas ibn Sam‘an (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever among you lives to see him, let him recite the opening verses of Soorat al-Kahf against him.” Abu Dawud (4324) added: “for that is your protection against his tribulation.” Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Silsilat al-Ahadith as-Sahihah (582).\nLearning and understanding the sound texts which describe him and his tribulation, so that the Muslim will be able to recognize it and avoid it if he lives until his time.\nFollowing the advice of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to flee from the Dajjal and keep away from him.\nAbu Dawud (4319) narrated that ‘Imran ibn Husayn said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever hears of the Dajjal, let him go far away from him, for by Allah a man will come to him thinking that he is a believer, and he will follow him because of the specious arguments that he presents.” Classed as sahih by Shaykh al-Albani in Sahih Sunan Abi Dawud (3/30).\nWe ask Allah, the Most Generous, to protect us and you, and all the Muslims from all tribulations, both apparent and hidden.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/404812/what-is-the-way-to-save-oneself-from-the-tribulation-of-the-dajjal
67618,"Are these prayers done with the recitation out loud or quietly: the optional prayer of Maghrib, the third Rak`ah of Witr prayer when it is done like Maghrib [three consecutive Rak`ahs], Qiyam Al-Layl [voluntary prayers at night], Sunnah of Fajr, and Duha prayer?","['Praise be to Allah.Can you pray Sunnah prayer out loud?\nThe scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) stated that what is prescribed is for the worshipper to recite quietly in optional prayers offered during the day, and when praying at night, he has the choice between reciting out loud or quietly, but reciting out loud is better.\nIn Kashshaf Al-Qina` (1/441), it says that what is meant by day here is sunrise, not the break of dawn, so the regular Sunnah prayer of Fajr is a prayer that is offered at night.\nBased on that, the worshipper should recite quietly in Duha prayer, because it is a prayer that is offered during the day.\nWith regard to the optional prayer of Maghrib , the third Rak`ah or Witr, Qiyam Al-Layl and the Sunnah of Fajr , the worshipper has the choice between reciting out loud or quietly, although reciting out loud is better, unless reciting quietly helps him to focus more, or he has people with him who will be disturbed by his reciting out loud, such as one who sleeping or one who is sick, and the like.\nShaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“The Sunnah in prayers at night is to recite out loud, whether the worshipper is praying on his own or has someone else with him. If his wife or other women are praying with him , then they should pray behind him, even if there is only one woman. If he is praying on his own, then he has the choice between reciting out loud or quietly, and what is prescribed is for him to do that which help him focus more. `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) was asked about that and she said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would sometimes recite out loud in his night prayers and sometimes he would recite quietly. It is proven from him (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), in the Hadith of Hudhayfah (may Allah be pleased with him) and others, that he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to recite out loud in the night prayers; he would pause at a verse that spoke of mercy and ask for mercy, and he would pause at a verse that mentioned punishment and seek refuge with Allah from that, and he would pause at a verse that mentioned glorification of Allah and glorify Him, meaning when reciting verses that mention the divine names and attributes, so he would glorify Allah. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {There has certainly been for you in the Messenger of Allah an excellent pattern [example.]} [Al-Ahzab 33:21] And the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Pray as you have seen me praying.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari in his Sahih)\nThese Hadiths indicate that reciting out loud in the night prayers is better, and that is because it helps the heart to focus more and is more beneficial to those who are listening, unless there are people around him who are sick or sleeping, or are praying or reading Quran, in which case it is better for him to lower his voice so that he will not distract other worshippers and readers, or wake up those who are sleeping, or disturb those who are sick.\nIf he recites quietly in some of the night prayers when he is alone, there is nothing wrong with that, because of the hadith of `Aishah mentioned above, and because that may help him to focus more and may be easier for him sometimes.” (Majmu` Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 11/124-125)\nThe Shaykh (may Allah have mercy on him) also said:\n“If a person is praying by himself, it is prescribed for him to do that which will help him to focus more, of reciting out loud or quietly, if he is offering a optional prayer at night and his reciting out loud will not disturb anyone. But if there are people around him who may be disturbed by his reciting out loud, such as other worshippers, people who are reading the Quran or people who are sleeping, it is prescribed for him to keep his voice low.\nBut with regard to prayers offered during the day, such as Duha prayer , regular Sunnah prayers, Dhuhr and `Asr, the Sunnah is to recite quietly in these prayers.” (Majmu` Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 11/126-127)\nCan you pray Witr with three Rak`ahs like Maghrib?\xa0\nWith regard to the questioner mentioning the third Rak`ah of Witr prayer when it is done like Maghrib [three consecutive Rak`ahs], the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade praying Witr in the same manner as Maghrib, and he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not pray Witr with three Rak`ahs, making it like Maghrib.” (Narrated by Al-Hakim, 1/304; Al-Bayhaqi, 3/31; Ad-Daraqutni, p. 172) Al-Hafidh Ibn Hajar said in Fat-h Al-Bari (4/301): Its chain of narration is authentic according to the conditions of the two Shaykhs; Al-Bukhari and Muslim.\nHow the Prophet offered Witr prayer?\nIt is narrated in an authentic report from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that he prayed Witr with three Rak`ahs in two ways:\n\nA prayer of three Rak`ahs with two Tashahhuds and two Salams, so he prayed two Rak`ahs then said the Salam, then he prayed one Rak`ah and said the Salam.\n\nIt was narrated that Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to separate Ash-Shaf` [the even, the first two Rak`ahs of Witr] and Al-witr [the odd, the last Rak`ah of Witr] with a Taslim [saying Salam] that he made us hear. (Narrated by Ibn Hibban, 2435) Al-Hafidh Ibn Hajar said in Fat-h Al-Bari (2/482): “Its chain of narration is strong.”\n\nHe would pray the three Rak`ahs with one Tashahhud and two Taslims.\n\nIt was narrated that `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to pray Witr with three Rak`ahs, only sitting [for Tashahhud] in the last of them. (Narrated by Al-Bayhaqi, 4581) This Hadith was classed as authentic by Al-Hakim, and Adh-Dhahabi agreed with him. (Al-Mustadrak, 1/304. Classed as authentic by An-Nawawi in Al-Majmu`, 4/7)\nShaykh Al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“With regard to praying five or three, sitting between each two Rak`ahs without saying the Taslim, we do not find that to be proven from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). The basic principle is that it is permissible, but because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade praying Witr with three Rak`ahs, and explained that by saying, “Do not pray Witr with three Rak`ahs, making it like Maghrib,” in that case the one who prays Witr with three Rak`ahs must avoid making it resemble Maghrib, which may be done in two ways:\nThe first is by saying the Taslim between Ash-shaf` [the even, the first two Rak`ahs of Witr] and Al-witr [the odd, the last Rak`ah of Witr], which is the stronger view and is preferable; and the second is by not sitting [for Tashahhud] between the first two Rak`ahs and the last Rak`ah.

249932,Is white alum pure (tahir)?,"['Praise be to Allah.Alum is a strongly astringent substance, which is composed of crystals of aqueous potassium sulfate and aluminium sulfates. It appears in the form of transparent, colourless crystals which are solid.\nWhite alum is used for many purposes, and is used in cosmetics, deodorants and so on. It is also used for medical purposes, such as sterilization of wounds and relieving pain and infections in the gum, and so on.\nAlum is a pure (tahir) substance which it is permissible to use. It is like any other substance for which there is no evidence (in the religious texts) that it is impure or prohibited, because the basic principle is that things are pure and permissible, and cannot be deemed otherwise except on the basis of textual evidence.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: You should understand that in principle all things, regardless their types and characteristics, are permissible for humans and are pure, and it is not prohibited to handle them and touch them. This statement is very general in application and applies to all substances; these are very decisive and clear-cut words of great benefit and immense blessing, and the scholars refer to this principle in many cases and situations.\nThere is a great deal of evidence for that – from what I can call to mind of the religious texts – namely the Book of Allah, the Sunnah of His Messenger, and following the way of the believers which is referred to in the verses (interpretation of the meaning):\n{O you who have believed, obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you}\xa0[An-Nisa’ 4:59]\n{Your ally is none but Allah and [therefore] His Messenger and those who have believed}\xa0[Al-Ma’idah 5:55].\nThen come the methods of analogy, rational thought, and the right way of thinking and understanding.""(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa\xa0 21/535).\nWe have previously discussed this issue in the answer to question no. 231261 .\nThe jurists have stated that the Muslim can buy and sell it and use it for dyeing and the like. All of that is based on the basic ruling that it is pure.\nIt says in al-Muhit al-Burhani (7/83), which is one of the books of the Hanafis: There is nothing wrong with paying in advance [salam transaction] for cotton, linen, copper, iron, lead, brass, alum and so on.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/249932/is-white-alum-pure-tahir

It is best for the Muslim to recite all of them, saying it in one form on one occasion and in another form on another occasion, and so on, so that he will have done all the sunnahs. He should not limit himself only to some of them. But if that is too hard for him, then he should stick to what he is able to do, and there is no sin on him in sha Allah.\xa0\nWhat to say in Tashahhud\nThere follow some of the versions of the Tashahhud and blessings on the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that have been narrated in proven reports from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in the prayer.\n\nIbn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) recited the Tashahhud as follows:\xa0 At-tahiyyatu Lillahi was-salawatu wat-tayyibat, as-salamu `alayka ayyuhan-Nabiyyu wa rahmat-Allahi wa barakatuhu.
