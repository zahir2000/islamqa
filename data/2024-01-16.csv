120819,"There are few job opportunities in our country, unless you can find someone to help you to get a job, but that is in return for payment. Is this haram?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThere is nothing wrong with someone intervening to help you to get a permissible job, so long as his intervention does not deprive someone who is more qualified and more deserving of being appointed to that job, because he has more experience and is more able to do it, or because he applied before you, then they put you ahead of him. Therefore, if that results in someone who is more qualified being deprived of the job, then his intervening is haram, and it is not permissible for you to ask him for help. We have explained the ruling on such intervention in the answer to question no. 26801 .\nWith regard to giving money to the one who intervenes, that is subject to further discussion:\nIf he is going to put some effort into looking for a job for you and tell you about job opportunities, then it is permissible to give him something in return for his efforts, as is the case with employment agencies.\nBut if it will not require any effort on his part, and he is simply going to use his status and position, then this is what the jurists call the price of status or the price for using his status and respectable position. This is a matter concerning which the scholars differed. Some of them are of the view that it is permissible, as may be understood from the words of the Shafa‘is and Hanbalis. Others disallow it, or regard it as disliked (makruh), or say that the ruling depends on the circumstances. And these views are reflected in the Maliki madhhab.\nIt says in ar-Rawd al-Murbi‘, in the chapter on loans: If he says: “Get a loan of one hundred for me, and you will have ten,” that is valid, because it is in return for using his position and status. End quote.\nThere is an example of that in Mughni al-Muhtaj (3/53).\nIt says in al-Insaf (5/134): If he agrees to pay him something for getting him a loan using his position and status, it is valid, because it is in return for using his position and status. End quote.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Imam Ahmad said: If he says: “Get me a loan of one hundred from So-and-so, and you will have ten,” there is nothing wrong with that. But if he says: “Act as my guarantor [for a loan from] that person, and you will have one thousand,” that is not permissible.\nThat is because saying, “Get me a loan and you will have ten” is a payment for doing something permissible, so it is permissible, such as if he were to say: “Build me this wall, and you will have ten.” As for acting as a guarantor, the guarantor is committed to paying off the debt, and if he pays it off, then the one for whom he acted as guarantor will now owe it to him, so the guarantee will have become like a loan, and if he accepts payment, that loan will now be bringing a benefit, so it is not permissible.""(Al-Mughni\xa04/214).\nSecondly:\nIf he has the right to a job or anything else, but he cannot get it except by paying a bribe, it is permissible for him to do that, as we have explained in the answer to question no. 72268 .\nWe ask Allah to help us and you to obey Him and please Him.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/120819/middleman-charging-a-fee-in-return-for-intervening-on-the-basis-of-his-status
317610,"Is prayer valid if one did not wash Madhiy (pre-seminal fluid) from the testicles? I heard that the Shafi `is, Malikis, Hanafis and some of the Hanbalis do not think that we need to wash the testicles.","['Praise be to Allah.How to clean Madhiy\nMadhiy is something impure from which we must purify ourselves.\nIbn `Abd Al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“The regular, well-known substance of Madhiy is a matter concerning which there is consensus and no difference of opinion among the Muslims that it is obligatory to do Wudu because of it, and it is obligatory to wash it off because it is impure."" (At-Tamhid (21/207)\nSo if Madhiy is emitted and any of it gets onto the body, it is obligatory to wash the place it got onto. If someone prays knowing that there is any Madhiy on his body and he deliberately did not wash it, then his prayer is not valid .\nFor the ruling on prayer offered when the body or clothes are not pure, please see the answers to questions no.\xa012720 and\xa0195117 .\nWhat to do if Madhiy gets into the testicles\xa0\nIf the Madhiy gets onto the testicles, then they must be washed in order to remove this impurity, as stated above.\nBut if the Madhiy did not get onto them, and it did not go beyond the place where it was emitted, then in this case there is a difference of opinion among the scholars: is it sufficient to wash only the area of the penis where it was emitted, or must the entire penis, along with the testicles, be washed?\nThe view of Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) is that both the penis and the testicles must be washed.\nAl-Mirdawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Based on the view that it is impure, the penis and testicles must be washed if it is emitted, according to the correct view."" (Al-Insaf c2/328-329)\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) quoted as evidence for that the report narrated in Al-Bukhari and Muslim from `Ali (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) enjoined washing the private part; the apparent meaning indicates that what is meant is the entire private part. In books other than Al-Bukhari and Muslim – such as Musnad Ahmad etc. – it is narrated that it is enjoined to wash the testicles.\n`Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I was a man who emitted a great deal of Madhiy, so I told a man to ask the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) about that, because of the position of his daughter. He said: “Do Wudu and wash your private part.” (Al-Bukhari, 269 and Muslim, 303)\nThe apparent meaning of the word is that the entire private part is to be washed; however, the majority of scholars said that what is meant by “private part” here is the place where the Madhiy is emitted, and not the entire private part. They supported that by comparing it to all other types of impurities; in all other cases it is only required to wash the place where the impurity is.\nIbn Daqiq Al-`Id (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“The scholars differed as to whether he should wash the entire private part, or only the place where the impurity is. The majority are of the view that washing may be limited to the place where the impurity is…"" (Ihkam Al-Ahkam\xa0 1/74)\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“What is required is to wash only the place where the impurity is. This is our view and the view of the majority."" (Al-Majmu` 2/144)\nIbn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“The scholars differed concerning what is meant by the command to wash the private part in the case of Madhiy. Does it mean to wash only the area of the private part where the Madhiy got onto it – as is the case with urine – or to wash the entire private part?\nThere are two views concerning that, both of which were narrated from Malik and Imam Ahmad."" (Fath Al-Bari\xa0 1/304)\nIbn Daqiq Al-`Id (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“The majority of scholars chose not to interpret the word “private part” as referring to the entire area; rather they focused on the context, as what makes washing obligatory is the emission of the substance, which dictates that one may limit washing to the place from which it was emitted and the place it got to [on the body or clothes]."" (Ihkam Al-Ahkam 1/74)\nAbu Ja`far At-Tahhawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“In support of the view that only the place of emission and the place it got to [on the body or clothes] is to be washed, we may say by analogy that the emission of Madhiy is an emission of something that invalidates Wudu; as in the case of urination and defecation, all that is required is to wash the place from which it was emitted and the place it got to [on the body or clothes], and there is no need to wash any more than that, unless one wants to do Wudu and pray. The same applies with regard to bleeding from any part of the body, according to the view of those scholars who regard bleeding as invalidating Wudu.\nThis is the way in which the emission of Madhiy should be dealt with, since it is something that invalidates Wudu; it does not require any washing apart from washing it from wherever it got on the body, apart from washing in order to purify oneself for prayer (Wudu). Thus this argument is further supported by reasoning.\nThis is the view of Abu Hanifah, Abu Yusuf, and Muhammad ibn Al-Hasan (may Allah have mercy on them)."" (Sharh Ma`ani Al-Athar\xa0 1/48)\nThose who say that it is impure responded to that by noting that there is nothing to prevent suggesting that washing more than the place where it is emitted is required. There is a similar case to that in Islamic teaching, which is that it is obligatory to wash the entire body when Maniy is emitted . They also mentioned a benefit of that, which is that washing the penis and testicles stops the emission of Madhiy.\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“And because it is emitted as a result of desire, therefore it is reasonable to suggest that it is obligatory to wash more than the place where it is emitted, as in the case of Maniy . That is because the testicles are its vessel, so washing them will put a stop to it."" (Sharh Al-`Umdah 1/103)\nIt was narrated by Imam Ahmad in Al-Musnad (2/293), and by Abu Dawud (208), from Hisham ibn `Urwah, from `Urwah, that `Ali ibn Abu Talib said to Al-Miqdad (may Allah be pleased with them) … and he mentioned a similar report and said: So Al-Miqdad asked the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and he said: “Let him wash his penis and testicles.”\nIbn Hajar said in At-Talkhis Al-Tahbir (1/117):\n“It was narrated by Abu Dawud via `Urwah from `Ali, and in it it says: “Let him wash his testicles and his penis.” `Urwah did not hear [directly] from `Ali, but Abu `Awanah narrated in his Sahih from `Ubaydah from `Ali with this additional text, and there is nothing wrong with its Isnad [chain of narration].”\nAs-San`ani said in Subul As-Salam (1/199):\n“As it is authentic, there is no reason not to accept the ruling based on it.”\nAbu Dawud (211) narrated from Al-`Ala\xa0ibn Al-Harith, from Haram ibn Hakim, from his paternal uncle `Abdullah ibn Sa`d Al-Ansari (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: I asked the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) about what necessitates Ghusl and about water [i.e., fluid] that is emitted [successively] after water. He (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “That [fluid] is Madhiy, and every male emits Madhiy. So wash it from your private part and your testicles, then do Wudu\xa0as for prayer.” (1/207). (Classed as authentic by Shaykh Al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) in Sahih Sunan Abu Dawud, 1/381)\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“What is required in the case of Madhiy is to wash the penis and testicles."" (Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 17/58)\nThe scholars of the Permanent Committee for Ifta\xa0said:\n“… With regard to Madhiy, it is impure. If you emit Madhiy, you must wash the penis from its base, and the testicles, and sprinkle water over whatever parts of the clothes and body the Madhiy got onto, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed `Ali to wash his penis and testicles and do Wudu in the case of Madhiy, and he instructed him to sprinkle water over whatever of it got onto his clothes.\nAnd Allah is the source of strength. May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and Companions.” (Permanent Committee for Academic Research and Ifta- `Abdullah ibn Qa`ud, `Abdullah ibn Ghadyyan, `Abd Ar-Razzaq `Afifi, `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn `Abdullah ibn Baz.""(Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Daimah 5/382)\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\nWhat is the correct view with regard to washing the penis and testicles when Madhiy is emitted?\nHe replied:\n“The correct view is that it is obligatory, and there is a medical benefit in doing that, which is that washing the penis and testicles stops the emission of Madhiy ."" (Ta`liqat Ash-Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin `Ala Al-Kafi)\nSo the correct view is that it is obligatory to wash the penis and testicles when Madhiy is emitted, because of the soundness of the Hadith which enjoins that.\nWith regard to the validity of prayer , with regard to such matters which are subject to Ijtihad, there is no blame on the one who follows one of the two scholarly views, so long as he believes that it is the correct view, or he is following a scholar whose view it is.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/317610/how-to-clean-madhiy
309254,"How can we reconcile between the two following hadiths? The first hadith is “Whoever does you a favour, then reciprocate him, and if you cannot find anything with which to reciprocate him, then offer supplication for him until you think that you have reciprocated him.” The second hadith is: “Whoever intervenes for his brother and he gives him a gift for that and he accepts it, he has engaged in a major form of riba.” I am confused about this matter, because we have a colleague who helps us with some personal issues of ours and looks after our interests in some other government departments, not as part of his job or his specialty, but out of generosity on his part. Can we reciprocate him for that or not?","['Praise be to Allah.It was narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does you a favour, then reciprocate him, and if you cannot find anything with which to reciprocate him, then offer supplication for him until you think that you have reciprocated him.” Narrated by Abu Dawud (1672) and an-Nasa’i (2567). Shaykh al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) said: al-Hakim said: It is sahih according to the conditions of the two shaykhs (al-Bukhari and Muslim), and adh-Dhahabi agreed with him.

The first hadith is when the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does you a favour, then reciprocate him…”\nThe second hadith is: “Whoever intervenes for his brother and he gives him a gift for that and he accepts it, he has engaged in a major form of riba.”\nThis person who intervened for his brother undoubtedly did him a favour, so if he wants to reciprocate him, how can that be regarded as riba? Please advise us, may Allah reward you with good. Can this be understood as referring to when a payment is stipulated or a payment is given for doing that?\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) replied:\nWhat is referred to in this hadith is intervention that is done for the sake of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, so he should not accept payment for it, because that which is done for the hereafter cannot be a means of worldly gain, and because if the one who intervenes for the sake of Allah is given a gift, his desire for worldly gain may overwhelm him in the future, so he may expect some worldly gain for his intervention. Hence the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) warned against accepting gifts [in return for intervening].""(Liqa’ al-Bab al-Maftuh\xa0 83/16).\n-2-\nThe hadith of Abu Umamah (may Allah be pleased with him) may be understood as referring to the kind of intervening that is obligatory, such as intervening to stop oppression or to restore rights that have been taken from someone, and the like.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAs for gifts in return for intervening, such as one who intervenes on behalf of a man with someone in authority, so that some wrong that has been done to him may be put right, or so that he may get what is due to him, or so that he may be appointed to a position of authority that he deserves, or so that he may be accepted to join the troops – when he is qualified for that – or so that he may be granted something from a waqf (endowment) that is allocated to the poor, jurists, reciters of Qur’an, devoted worshippers and so on – when he is deserving of that – and other types of intervention in which the one who intervenes helps to make sure that something obligatory is done or that something prohibited is stopped: in these cases too it is not permissible to accept gifts, but it is permissible for the giver of the gift to give as much as will enable him to get what is rightfully his or to ward off oppression. This is what was narrated from the early generations and the major scholars.\nSome later jurists granted a concession allowing that, and regarded it as coming under the heading of “payment for some service.” But this is contrary to the Sunnah and the views of the Sahabah and senior scholars, so it is wrong, because such actions come under the heading of serving the public interest that one should do as a duty and obligatory act, either as an individual obligation or as a communal obligation.""(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa\xa0 31/287).\nShaykh al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAbu Dawud included this hadith in a chapter entitled: Chapter on gifts given to one who does an errand or helps with something.\nBased on that, I say: if a person has an issue that the one who is intervening is obliged to help his brother with, such as if he wants to intervene for him with the judge in order to relieve him of some wrong that is being done to him, or to help him get what is rightfully his, and similar matters which Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) discussed in detail…\nIt may occur to some people that this hadith contradicts the hadith in which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does you a favour, then reciprocate him, and if you cannot find anything with which to reciprocate him, then offer supplication for him until you think that you have reciprocated him.”\nI say: There is no contradiction, because this is to be understood as referring to issues in which help does not involve intervening, or something that is not obligatory.""(As-Silsilah as-Sahihah\xa0 7/1372).\n-3-\nThe hadith of Abu Umamah is to be understood as referring to all forms of intervention that are aimed at helping others, and this is an exception to the hadith of Ibn ‘Umar.\nAs-San‘ani (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Subul as-Salaam (5/128), commenting on the hadith of Abu Umamah:\nPerhaps what is meant is that if the intervention is concerning something that is obligatory… or is aimed at stopping something that is prohibited… (then it is haram to give a gift).\nIf the intervention has to do with something that is permissible, perhaps it is permissible to accept the gift, because it is by way of reciprocation for a kind action that is not obligatory.\nOr it may be haram, because the intervention is something minor (that does not require much effort), therefore one should not accept a gift in return. End quote.\nSecondly:\nWith regard to your question:\nIf this employee does some work and puts effort into it, then there is nothing wrong with giving him payment or a gift in return for that, because it may be regarded as being in return for the work that he did.\nBut if his work is limited to (verbal) intervention only, and he does not do any other work, then this is a matter concerning which there is a difference of scholarly opinion.

67801,"Many Muslims greet their brothers by saying “Salamun `alaykum”. Is it permissible for us to say that? If it is not correct, will the one who does that still be rewarded for saying Salam?.","['Praise be to Allah.Is greeting with Salamun `Alaykum Correct?\nThere is nothing wrong with the person who is initiating the greeting saying, “Salamun `alaykum” or `Salamun `alayka.” Allah tells us that the greeting of the angels to the people of Paradise will be “Salamun `alaykum ” as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And angels shall enter unto them from every gate (saying): `Salamun `Alaykum (peace be upon you) for you persevered in patience! Excellent indeed is the final home!’” [Ar-Ra`d 13:23, 24]\n“And those who kept their duty to their Lord (Al-Muttaqun – the pious) will be led to Paradise in groups till when they reach it, and its gates will be opened (before their arrival for their reception) and its keepers will say: Salamun `Alaykum (peace be upon you)! You have done well, so enter here to abide therein.” [Az-Zumar 39:73]\xa0\nThe Salam in this form is also mentioned in the verse where Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Those whose lives the angels take while they are in a pious state (i.e. pure from all evil, and worshipping none but Allah Alone) saying (to them): Salamun `Alaykum (peace be on you) enter you Paradise, because of that (the good) which you used to do (in the world).” [An-Nahl 16:32]\xa0\n“And when they hear Al-Laghw (dirty, false, evil or vain talk), they withdraw from it and say: `To us our deeds, and to you your deeds. Peace be to you (Salamun `Alaykum). We seek not (the way of) the ignorant.’” [Al-Qasas 28:55]\xa0\n“When those who believe in Our Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) come to you, say: Salamun `Alaykum (peace be on you); your Lord has written (prescribed) Mercy for Himself, so that if any of you does evil in ignorance, and thereafter repents and does righteous good deeds (by obeying Allah), then surely, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” [Al-An`am 6:54]\xa0\nIbn Hibban narrated (493) from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that a man passed by the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when he was in a gathering and said, “Salamun `alaykum.” He (the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)) said, “Ten rewards.” Another man passed by and said, “Salamun `alaykum wa rahmatu-Allahi (Peace be upon you and the mercy of Allah).” He said, “Twenty rewards.” Then another man passed by and said, “Salamun `alaykum wa rahmatu-Allahi wa barakatuhu (Peace be upon you and the mercy of Allah and His blessings).” He said: “Thirty rewards.” A man got up and left the gathering and did not say Salam. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “How soon your companion has forgotten. When one of you comes to a gathering and says Salam, if he wants to sit down then let him do so. Then when he wants to leave, let him say Salam, for the one is not more important than the other.” (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Targhib wal-Tarhib, 2712)\xa0\nThis and other evidence indicates that there is nothing wrong with saying Salam to a person by saying “Salamun `alaykum.”\xa0 He will be rewarded for that, and he deserves a response to his Salam.\xa0\nWhich is better: As-Salamu `alaykum or Salamun `alaykum?\nThe scholars differed as to which version is better, As-Salamu `alaykum or Salamun `alaykum, or whether they are both the same.\xa0\nAl-Mardawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Insaf (2/563): “If a person greets a living person, then the correct view in our Madhhab is that he has the choice between using the definite form (with Al-) or the indefinite (without Al-). And he said: this was stated by more than one.”\nThen he mentioned a report from Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) which says that the definite form is better than the indefinite, and he quoted Ibn `Aqil (may Allah have mercy on him) as saying that the indefinite is better than the definite. \xa0\nAl-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Adhkar (p. 356-358):\xa0\n“Note that it is preferable for the Muslim to say “As-Salamu `alaykum wa rahmatu-Allahi wa barakatuhu”, using the plural pronoun (-kum), even if he is greeting only one person. The respondent should say, “Wa `alaykum As-Salam wa rahmatu-Allahi wa barakatuhu.”\xa0\nOur companions said: If the one who is initiating the greeting says, “As-Salamu `alaykum,” then he has given the greeting. If he said “As-Salamu `alayka” or “Salamun `alayka” this also counts as the greeting.\xa0\nAs for the response, the minimum is to say, `Wa `alayka As-Salam” or “Wa `alaykum As-Salam.” If the waw is omitted and one says, “`Alaykum As-Salam” that is sufficient and is a response.\xa0\nIf the person who is initiating the greeting says “Salamun `alaykum” or “As-Salamu `alaykum,” in both cases the respondent may say, “Salamun `alaykum” , or he may say, “As-Salamu `alaykum”. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“When they came in to him and said: `Salam, (peace be upon you)!’ He answered: `Salam, (peace be upon you)’” [Adh-Dhariyaat 51:25]\nImam Abul Hasan Al-Wahidi (may Allah have mercy on him), one of our companions, said: You have the choice between using the definite form (As-Salam) or the indefinite (Salamun).\xa0\nI (An-Nawawi) say: But the alif and lam are preferable (i.e., saying the word Salam with the definite article Al-).”\xa0\nIs it permissible to initiate the greeting by saying `Alayk As-Salam or `Alaykum As-Salam?\xa0\nWhat is disliked is for the one who is initiating the greeting to say ‘`Alayka As-Salam’ or ‘`Alaykum As-Salam,’ because this is the greeting given to the dead as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said.\xa0\nAbu Dawud (5209) and At-Tirmidhi (2722) narrated that Abu Jurayy Al-Hujaymi (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: “ `Alayka As-Salam (upon you be peace), O Messenger of Allah.” He said, “Do not say ` `Alayka As-Salam’, for `Alayka As-Salam’ is the greeting of the dead.” This Hadith was classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud.\xa0\nWhat is meant by the Prophet’s words “`Alayka As-Salam’ is the greeting of the dead” is the fact that many poets and others greeted the dead in this manner. Moreover the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is to greet the dead in the same manner as he greeted the living, by saying “As-Salamu `alaykum.”\xa0\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said, explaining that:\xa0\n“His greeting, when he was initiating the greeting, was to say, “As-Salamu `alaykum wa rahmatu-Allah”. He did not like the initiator to say “`Alayka’l-Salam.” Abu’l-Jurayy Al-Hujaymi said: I came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: “ `Alayka As-Salam (upon you be peace), O Messenger of Allah.” He said, “Do not say ‘`Alayka As-Salam’, for `Alayka As-Salam’ is the greeting of the dead.” (This Hadith was classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud)\nThis Hadith confused some people, who thought that it contradicted what was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about greeting the dead by saying, “As-Salamu `alaykum,” saying the word Salam first. They thought that his words, “`Alayka As-Salam’ is the greeting of the dead” was describing what is prescribed, but that is a mistake which led them to think that there was a contradiction. Rather what is meant by the words “`Alaykas-Salam’ is the greeting of the dead” is a statement of something that used to happen, not something that was prescribed, namely that the poets and others used to greet the dead in this manner, and he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not like the greeting commonly used for the dead to become widespread.” (Zad Al-Ma`ad, 2/383)\nWhat is the best way to greet someone in Islam?\xa0\nThe most complete form of greeting is to say “As-Salamu `alaykum wa rahmatu-Allahi wa barakatuhu (Peace be upon you and the mercy of Allah and His blessings)” or “Salamun `alaykum wa rahmatu-Allahi wa barakatuhu”, because of the Hadith of Ibn Hibban quoted above, and because of the Hadith narrated by Abu Dawud (5195) and At-Tirmidhi (2689) from `Imran ibn Husayn (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: A man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: “As-Salamu `alaykum,” and he returned the greeting, then he sat down. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Ten.” Then another man came and said, “As-Salamu `alaykum wa rahmatu-Allah,” and he returned the greeting, then he sat down. He said, “Twenty.” Then another man came and said As-Salamu `alaykum wa rahmatu-Allahi wa barakatuhu,” and he returned the greeting, then he sat down. He said, “Thirty.” (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud)\nAs for adding the words “wa maghfiratuhu (and His forgiveness)” or “wa ridwanuhu (and His pleasure)”, these are not mentioned in any authentic report from our Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), as was stated by Ibn Al-Qayyim in Zad Al-Ma`ad (2/381) and by Al-Albani in Da`if Abu Dawud (5196). \xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/67801/is-salamun-alaykum-correct
