436389,"If someone is travelling at the time of Eid al-Adha, so he asks someone else to pay money for the udhiyah to one of the charities that do udhiyah on behalf of people, but he does not mention a particular charity, so the other person chooses one of the charities and pays the price of the udhiyah,  but they do not ask him the name of the donor, so the charity takes the price of the udhiyah without the donor’s name, and the proxy thinks that it is not necessary to mention the name of the donor of the udhiyah – is it essential to mention the name of the donor? If it is essential to mention the name of the donor, does the other person who chose the charity and paid on behalf of the donor have to do anything, or is he liable?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly: There is nothing wrong with giving a charity money to do the udhiyah; this comes under the heading of delegating them as a proxy to slaughter the udhiyah.\nCharities undertake to do that in two ways:\nThe first way is mentioning the donors by name, so they have a list of their names and a sheep will be slaughtered on behalf of So-and-so son of So-and-so, and a cow will be slaughtered on behalf of seven specific people who are named in the list, and they do that for each cow. This is what is obligatory.\nThe second way is not mentioning the donors by name; rather if they have one hundred people, for example, they will slaughter one hundred sheep on their behalf, without stating that this sheep is on behalf of So-and-so, and this one is on behalf of So-and-so. This is not valid.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Some Hajj groups collect money from the pilgrims to offer the hadiy (sacrifice) on their behalf, but they do not mention the name of each person [at the time of slaughter]. Is this permissible?\nHe replied: This is not permissible. It is essential to name the person on whose behalf the sacrifice is being slaughtered. So for example, if there are thirty men in the group, and they bought thirty sheep for them, then he [the slaughterman] should have on hand a list of their names, and every time he slaughters a sheep, he should say: This is on behalf of So-and-so. It is essential to mention the names. As for slaughtering thirty sheep on behalf of thirty men, that is not right.""(Al-Liqa’ ash-Shahri\xa0 73/32).\nAnd he (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: We have heard from you that you warned against giving money to these companies, but what is the solution\xa0 regarding what is past? We did Hajj more than once, and we gave money to these companies, but they did not take our names. What is the ruling on what is past? Is it valid? If it is not valid, then what must we do?\nAnswer: We did not warn against giving the hadiy, because the hadiy (sacrifice) is in fact necessary. The person has two options: either he can give it to these companies (charities), or he can slaughter it himself and leave it in the place where he slaughters it, and no one will benefit from it, neither he himself nor anyone else.\nBut if it so happens that a person slaughters his sacrifice, eats some of it and gives some of it as gifts and as charity, then undoubtedly this is much better. This is something that some people can do who have acquaintances in Makkah; they can appoint a proxy to do it on their behalf, and they can say: Slaughter the sacrifice on our behalf. In that case, it will be made use of. Or he can go to Makkah himself, and go to the slaughterhouse, and buy an animal and slaughter it there, and he will find people crowding around him to take some of the meat from him.\nBut what I think is that it is a grievous mistake to send the value of the udhiyah to another country, so that it may be slaughtered there. This is the thing for which there is no basis.\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to send the hadiy to Makkah to be slaughtered in Makkah, and there is no report from him, and no hadith, sound or weak, to suggest that he would send his udhiyah to any other place. Rather he would slaughter it in his own house, and they [his family] would eat some of it, give some of it as gifts and give some of it as charity.""(Al-Liqa’ ash-Shahri\xa0 34/17).\nBased on that, if the charity did not record your friend’s name, this means that they did not specify that this slaughter was done on his behalf. Rather they did it as we mentioned in the second scenario, in which they slaughter a number of animals on behalf of a number of people without mentioning them by name, and this is not permissible.\nPlease see the answer to question no. 126662 .\nSecondly:\nIf the donor was not mentioned by name, then no one is liable – with regard to what has happened in the past – and we ask Allah to accept the udhiyah from the donors. But he should not do that again with the udhiyah in the future.\nWe asked our shaykh, ‘Abd ar-Rahman al-Barrak (may Allah preserve him) about what should be done in a case when the udhiyah was not done in the name of a specific person, and who is responsible in the case when the number of animals slaughtered is fewer than the number required?\nHe said: It is obligatory to mention names.\nBut if names are not mentioned, we do not say that it is just regular meat; rather it is something that Allah has enjoined and He will reward the donor for it.\nIn the case of any shortfall in the numbers of sheep, or if some of the sheep die, the one who neglected to mention the names of the donors is the one who must bear responsibility.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/436389/what-is-the-ruling-on-charities-slaughtering-udhiyah-sacrifices-without-mentioning-the-donors-by-name-at-the-time-of-slaughter
126343,"I have some questions having to do with some types of food:
1. Is it permissible to eat the testicles of halal-slaughtered animals, such as goats for example?
2. Is it permissible to eat shrimp?
3. Is it permissible to eat crabs?
4. I heard that there are seven animals that it is not permissible to eat; can you clarify?","['Praise be to Allah.Are testicles permissible?\nIt is permissible to eat the testicles of lawfully-slaughtered animals, as there is no evidence to suggest that it is not permissible, and the basic principle is that things are permissible.\xa0\nIt says in Al-Mudawwanah:\n“That which may be included with meat, such as fat, liver, stomach, heart, lungs, spleen, kidneys, neck, testicles, feet, head and the like, comes under the same ruling as meat.” (Tahdhib Al-Mudawwanah by Al-Baradha`i, 1/93) (See also Mawahib Al-Jalil, 6/204)\xa0\nThe Standing Committee was asked:\xa0\nIs it permissible to eat the testicles of an animal that are cut off whilst it is alive?\xa0\nThe committee replied:\xa0\n“It is not permissible to eat anything that has been cut from an animal that may be eaten, when it is alive, such as the testicles, fatty tail, and so on, because that comes under the ruling on “dead meat”, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whatever is cut from an animal when it is still alive is `dead meat.’” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 22/501-502)\xa0\nThis implies that it may be eaten if it comes from an animal that has been slaughtered in the prescribed manner.\xa0\nHowever, some scholars regarded it as disliked to eat them, because this is something that people usually find off-putting.\xa0\nIt says in Al-Mughni (3/296): “That part of the animal is not regarded as good to eat.”\nAz-Zayla`i (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Tabyin Al-Haqa’iq (6/226):\xa0\n“It is disliked to eat the vagina, testicles, glands, bladder and gallbladder of sheep, because they are things that people find distasteful and they dislike them.”\xa0\nIs eating crab permissible in Islam?\nThe basic principle with regard to sea creatures is that they are permissible to eat , because Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Lawful to you is (the pursuit of) water game and its use for food - for the benefit of yourselves and those who travel.” [Al-Ma’idah 5:96]\nAl-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated (5/2091):\xa0\n“`Umar said: Its “game” is that which is hunted and caught, and its “food” is that which it casts up (onto the shore). Abu Bakr said: That which floats is permissible. Ibn `Abbas said: Its “food” is its “dead meat” (that which dies without being slaughtered in the prescribed manner), except that which has started to rot. Shurayh, the companion of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: Everything in the sea is (regarded as if it was) slaughtered in the prescribed manner.”\xa0\nAnd the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said concerning the sea: “Its water is a means of purification and its ‘dead meat’ is permissible.” (Narrated and classed as authentic by At-Tirmidhi, 69. Also narrated by Abu Dawud, 83; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Al-Irwa’, 1/42)\xa0\nAnd the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whatever Allah has permitted in His Book is permissible; whatever He has prohibited is prohibited; and whatever He has remained silent about is pardoned, so accept Allah’s pardon, for Allah is never forgetful.” Then he recited this verse (interpretation of the meaning): “and your Lord is never forgetful.” [Maryam 19:64] (Narrated by Al-Bayhaqi, 20216; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in As-Sahihah, 2256)\xa0\nBased on the above, eating shrimp and crab is permissible and there is no reason not to eat them, because of the general meaning of the evidence which indicates that everything caught from the sea is permissible.\xa0\nBut if it is proven that any of these things are toxic or harmful to the one who eats them, then it is prohibited to eat them, because of the harm that it may cause, not because it is prohibited in and of itself.\xa0\nNumber of prohibited animals in Islam\nWe do not know of any text that limits the number of prohibited animals to seven. Moreover, there cannot be any such limit if we examine the texts. The texts say that pigs, any wild animal that has fangs, any bird that has talons, tame donkeys and scavengers are all prohibited.\xa0\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed that five animals are to be killed , namely: crows, kites, rats, scorpions and vicious dogs.\nFor more details, please refer to the following answers: 231261 , 2841 , 85534 , and 70320 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/126343/is-eating-testicles-permissible
503975,"What is the ruling on what some people do, whereby they give in charity the costs of doing ‘umrah to someone who wants to do ‘umrah, with the intention of that being an ongoing charity (sadaqah jariyah) on behalf of someone who has died? Meaning that the reward of the charity will go to the deceased, and it will allow the pilgrim to do ‘umrah if he intends to do that ‘umrah on behalf of himself?","['Praise be to Allah.We have previously stated that it is permissible to give money to one in need so that he can do ‘umrah or Hajj. Please see the answer to question no. 346822.\nGiving money to someone so that he can do ‘umrah with it is an act of kindness, so it is an act of charity.\nMuslim (1005) narrated from Hudhayfah that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Every good deed is a charity.”\nIt says in al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah al-Kuwaitiyyah (26/323):\nIn linguistic terms, sadaqah (charity) refers to what is given for the purpose of drawing closer to Allah, may He be exalted, not for the purpose of showing kindness to someone …\nIn Islamic terminology, it means giving something during one’s lifetime for nothing in return, for the purpose of drawing close to Allah, may He be exalted…\nAl-Hattab said: If a gift (hibah) is given purely for the purpose of seeking reward in the hereafter, then it is charity (sadaqah). Something similar was stated by al-Ba‘li al-Hanbali in al-Mutli‘ ‘ala Abwab al-Muqni‘. End quote.\nGiving charity on behalf of one who has died is prescribed according to scholarly consensus, and there is the hope that the reward will reach both the giver and the deceased person on whose behalf he gave charity.\nShaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nGiving charity on behalf of one who has died is prescribed, and will benefit the deceased. It is soundly narrated in as-Sahihayn from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that he was asked about that. A man said to him: O Messenger of Allah, my mother has died; will she have reward if I give charity on her behalf? He said: “Yes.” Thus charity will benefit the deceased, and there is the hope that the giver will have a reward similar to that which reaches the deceased, because he has done a good deed voluntarily, so there is the hope that he will have a reward like what he gave…""(Fatawa Nur ‘ala ad-Darb\xa0 14/312).\nFor more information, please see the answers to questions no. 42384 and 219751 .\nConclusion:\nIt is prescribed for the Muslim to donate money to a needy person so that he can do ‘umrah, and to dedicate the reward for that money to a Muslim who has died.\nBut we should point out that this charity is not ongoing charity (sadaqah jariyah); rather it is charity that will come to an end. Ongoing charity refers to a waqf (Islamic endowment) that is not used up or consumed, and is not spent; rather it is wealth that is put into a permanent asset that can be used and reused, such as if wealth is used to build a mosque or donate books of knowledge as a waqf, and the like.\nHelping a pilgrim to do Hajj or ‘umrah by giving him money is an act of charity on behalf of the deceased, and will help him in sha Allah, but it is not ongoing charity (sadaqah jariyah).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/503975/what-is-the-ruling-on-giving-in-charity-on-behalf-of-one-who-has-died-the-costs-of-doing-umrah
22203,"Could u please tell us relating the 'Day of judgement' it's tortures,the questions that wud be asked.","['Praise be to Allah.Questions on the grave\nIt is proven in the Quran and Sunnah that when a person dies, he will be called to account for every major and minor action he did in this world, whether it was good or bad. He will be rewarded for his good deeds and punished for his bad deeds.\xa0\nThe first stage of that reckoning is in the grave . In the grave, the first thing a person will be asked will be: Who was your Lord? What is your religion? Who is this man who was sent amongst you? – as was narrated in the Hadith of Al-Bara’ ibn `Azib (may Allah be pleased with him), which was narrated by Abu Dawud in his Sunan (4753) and classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud, 2979.\xa0\nWhat questions will be asked on the Day of Judgement?\nThen on the Day of Resurrection he will be brought to account for every major and minor action , even though he has already been brought to account for that in the grave . The first thing for which he will be brought to account for then will be his prayer.\xa0\nIt was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The first thing among their deeds for which the people will be brought to account on the Day of Resurrection will be prayer. Our Lord will say to His angels, although He knows best, `Look at My slave’s prayer, is it complete or lacking?’ If it is complete, it will be recorded as complete, but if it is lacking, He will say, `Look and see whether my slave did any optional prayers.’ If he had done voluntary prayers, He will say, `Complete the obligatory prayers of My slave from his voluntary prayers.’ Then the rest of his deeds will be examined in a similar manner.”\xa0((Narrated by Abu Dawud, 864; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud, 770)\nOn the Day of Resurrection, people will be asked about other matters, including the following:\xa0\n\nIt was narrated from Ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The son of Adam will not be dismissed from before his Lord on the Day of Resurrection until he has been questioned about five things: his life and how he spent it, his youth and how he used it, his wealth and how he earned it and how he disposed of it, and how he acted upon what he acquired of knowledge.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 2422; classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Tirmidhi, 1969)\xa0\nAnd the nations will be asked on the Day of Resurrection:\xa0\n\n“What answer gave you to the Messengers?” [Al-Qasas 28:65 – interpretation of the meaning]\nThese are some of the things about which people will be asked on the Day of Resurrection.
