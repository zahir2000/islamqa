292835,"I am a teenager, and while browsing the internet, I entered a site for chatting with strangers, and suddenly I saw a naked person fondling his private part, and suddenly a drop of semen was discharged from me involuntarily during my fasting, knowing that I did not fondle my private part, and I did not want that to happen, so what is legally required of me?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt is incumbent upon a person who sincerely advises themselves to be extremely cautious of following what their soul, which commands evil, and their devil whisper to them. Allah the Exalted says (translation of the meaning): {O you who have believed, do not follow the footsteps of Satan. And whoever follows the footsteps of Satan - indeed, he enjoins immorality and wrongdoing} (An-Nur 24:21).\nAbu Sa`id Al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: ""A man should not look at the private parts of another man, and a woman should not look at the private parts of another woman."" Reported by Muslim (338).\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n""This contains the prohibition of a man looking at the private parts of another man, and a woman looking at the private parts of another woman, and there is no disagreement on this."" End quote.\nSecondly:\nA Muslim must protect their hearing, sight, and limbs from engaging in what Allah the Exalted has prohibited, especially when fasting; for it is neither wise nor in accordance with the Shari`ah for a person to fast from what Allah has made lawful of good things, and then let their hearing, sight, and tongue indulge in what Allah has prohibited.\nAbu Hurairah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: ""Whoever does not give up false speech and acting upon it, Allah has no need for him to leave his food and drink."" Reported by Al-Bukhari (1804).\nAnd Jabir ibn Abdullah Al-Ansari said: When you fast, let your hearing, sight, and tongue fast from lying and sin, leave off harming the servant, and let there be upon you dignity and tranquility on the day of your fast, and do not make your day of breaking the fast and your day of fasting alike.\nFor further benefit, please see the answers to questions number: (93723 ), (50063 ), and (66699 ).\nThirdly:\nIf semen is discharged due to repeated looking, then according to the most correct opinion of the scholars, the fast is invalidated; contrary to the opinion of those who say it does not break the fast, just as ejaculation due to thought does not break the fast.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n""Our argument is that it is ejaculation caused by an act that one finds pleasure in, and it is possible to avoid; therefore, it invalidates the fast, like ejaculation caused by touching.\nThinking is not something one can avoid, unlike repeated looking."" End quote from ""Al-Mughni"" (3/129).\nIn conclusion:\nWhat you must do regarding what you have done are two things:\n- Hasten to repent to Allah for what has emanated from you, hoping that He may accept your repentance and forgive you.\n- Make up for that day, and there is no expiation required from you, because expiation is only obligatory for someone who invalidates their fast through sexual intercourse.

30784,Is it permissible for me to go to sleep when I am Junub (due to intercourse) and wake up at the time of Fajr prayer to do Ghusl?,"['Praise be to Allah.It is permissible for one who is Junub to go to sleep before doing Ghusl , then wake up to do Ghusl before praying Fajr.\xa0\nThe evidence for that is the report narrated by At-Tirmidhi (110) from `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her), who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would go to sleep when he was Junub without touching water. (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in\xa0Sahih At-Tirmidhi,\xa0103)\nBut it is better for him to do Wudu before going to sleep, and if he does Ghusl that is best.\xa0\nIt was narrated from `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that she was asked: What did the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) do when he was Junub? Did he do Ghusl before going to sleep, or did he go to sleep before doing Ghusl? She said: He did both; sometimes he would do Ghusl then go to sleep, and sometimes he would do Wudu then go to sleep.

315220,"My question is related to fasting; as you are aware of its virtue and reward with Allah the Almighty, and by Allah, I love fasting. However, my problem is that I have a headache, the causes of which I don't even know. I have undergone many examinations, but to no avail. But all praise is due to Allah in any case. I had my last visit with a specialist in head diseases, who told me that recovery from my condition is almost impossible. In fact, he said: I must learn to live with this headache. What concerns me is that when I start fasting and half the day passes, the headache begins and continues until the next day, despite taking painkillers. This headache even affects me to the extent that I perform Salah with great difficulty. So, are there any acts of worship through which I can attain the reward of fasting? Knowing that in my heart - and my Lord knows best - if I were able to fast, I would fast. For clarification, I am talking about Optional fasting; because I had started fasting the six days of Shawwal yesterday. As for the Mandatory fast, all praise is due to Allah, I have completed it despite the illness. I also ask you by Allah the Almighty to pray for my healing.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nWe ask Allah to heal you and grant you well-being, and we bring you glad tidings that as long as you are keen on fasting, and were it not for illness you would have fasted, then the reward of a fasting person is recorded for you. Al-Bukhari (4423) narrated from Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him): ""The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) returned from the expedition to Tabuk and when he came near Medina, he said: \'There are people in Medina who were with you in every pass and valley you crossed.\' They said, \'O Messenger of Allah, even though they were in Medina?\' He said: \'Even though they were in Medina, because they were held back by a valid excuse.\'""\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Fath al-Bari: ""This indicates that a person can achieve the reward of those who do deeds if an excuse prevents him from doing the deeds."" End quote.\nAt-Tirmidhi (2325) and Ibn Majah (4228) narrated from Abu Kabshah al-Anmari that he heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) say: “In this world there are four types of people: a person upon whom Allah bestows wealth and knowledge, so he fears his Lord with regard to it, upholds ties of kinship with it, and acknowledges the rights of Allah concerning it – he will have the highest status; a person upon whom Allah bestows knowledge but does not grant him wealth, so he is sincere in his intention and says: ‘If I had wealth, I would do the same as So and so’ – so he will be rewarded according to his intention and the reward of both will be the same; a person upon whom Allah bestows wealth but does not grant him knowledge, so he squanders his wealth without knowledge, and does not fear his Lord with regard to it or uphold his ties of kinship with it, and he does not acknowledge the rights of Allah concerning it – he will be the lowest in status; and a person upon whom Allah has not bestowed wealth or knowledge, so he says: ‘If I had wealth, I would do the same as So and so’ – so he will be judged according to his intention, and the burden of sin of both will be the same.” The Hadith was authenticated by Al-Albani in ""Sahih At-Tirmidhi.""\nSecondly:\nThere are legislated deeds through which one may receive the reward of a fasting person.\nAmong these are:\n1- Caring for the widow and the poor:\nAl-Bukhari (5353) and Muslim (2982) narrated from Abu Hurairah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: ""The one who looks after a widow or a poor person is like a Mujahid (warrior) in the cause of Allah, or like one who fasts during the day and prays all night.""\nAn-Nawawi said in ""Sharh Muslim"" (18/112): ""The one who looks after them means the one who earns for them, takes care of their needs. The armalah (widow) is the one who has no husband, whether she has been married before or not. It was also said that it means the one who is separated from her husband."" End quote.\nIbn Hibban said in ""Al-Ifsah \'an Ma\'ani As-Sahihah"" (6/267): ""It means that Allah, the Exalted, combines for him the reward of a fasting person, a person who prays at night, and a Mujahid in one go; because he stands in place of the widow\'s husband whom fate has taken from her, and he causes her to be pleased with her Lord, and he takes care of that poor person who is unable to take care of himself..."" End quote.\nIbn Battal said in ""Sharh Sahih Al-Bukhari"" (9/218): ""Whoever is unable to engage in Jihad for the sake of Allah, or to pray at night and fast during the day, should act upon this Hadith, and look after widows and the poor so that he may be gathered on the Day of Resurrection among those who strive in the cause of Allah without having taken a step in that direction, or spent a dirham, or faced an enemy and been frightened by the encounter, or to be gathered among the ranks of those who fast and pray while he eats during the day and sleeps at night throughout his life.\xa0So every believer should be keen on this trade that does not perish, and to strive for a widow or a needy person for the sake of Allah the Almighty, thus earning in his trade the ranks of those who strive in Allah\'s cause, those who fast, and those who stand (in prayer) without fatigue or hardship. That is the Grace of Allah which He bestows upon whom He wills.""

The Hadith was authenticated by Al-Albani in ""Sahih At-Tirmidhi.""\n3- Providing Iftar for a fasting person:\nZaid ibn Khalid al-Juhani said: The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: ""Whoever provides Iftar for a fasting person will have a reward like his, without that detracting from the fasting person\'s reward in the slightest."" Narrated by At-Tirmidhi (807) and Ibn Majah (1746) and authenticated by Ibn Hibban (8/216) and Al-Albani in ""Sahih al-Jami\'"" (6415).\nThese deeds earn the doer the reward of a fasting person, as well as one who intends to fast but is prevented by a valid excuse.\nWe ask Allah for success and correctness for us and for you.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/315220/deeds-through-which-one-can-attain-the-rewards-of-the-fasting-person
272580,I would like to know the ruling on messages in WhatsApp asking for forgiveness before the month of Ramadan begins.,"['Praise be to Allah.All righteous deeds – whether they are acts of worship that are for Allah alone, may He be Glorified and Exalted, such as prayer, fasting and so on, or are acts of kindness towards other people – are all required at all times.\nThey are particularly encouraged at times of virtue, and these times are only given virtue so that people will compete at these times in doing all kinds of righteous and good deeds.\nOne of the righteous deeds that are encouraged and enjoined is to forgive one another and dispel rancour.\nIt is proven from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that he said: “If one of you starts his day fasting, let him not engage in any obscene or ignorant speech, and if someone insults him or argues with him, let him say: I am fasting, I am fasting.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 1894 and Muslim, 1151)\nHence, it is recommended for people to refrain from persisting in disputes, settling scores with opponents and answering back, and not to respond to offensive treatment in kind.\nAs the Muslim is striving to increase his righteous deeds at those times, and there is the fear that rancour may prevent his good deeds from being taken up to Allah, it is prescribed to ask people to forgive him.\nMuslim (2565) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The people’s deeds are shown (to Allah) twice every week, on Mondays and Thursdays, and every believing slave is forgiven, except a slave between whom and his brother there is some grudge. It is said: Leave these two until they reconcile.”\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Undoubtedly conflicts and disputes among people are a cause of good being withheld. The evidence for that is the fact that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) went out one night to his companions in Ramadan , to tell them about Laylat Al-Qadr , but two men among the Companions were arguing, so the knowledge of when it was in that year was taken away.… Therefore the individual should strive not to have any resentment in his heart towards any of the Muslims.” (Al-Liqa’ Ash-Shahri, no. 36)\nThe one who spreads a spirit of tolerance, asks people to forgive him and strives to right wrongs and to fulfil his duty towards others, and encourages others to do that, in Ramadan or otherwise, is undoubtedly following righteousness and doing good.\nIn conclusion, it is clearly recommended to ask people for forgiveness and to try to right wrongs at this special time. There does not seem to us to be anything wrong, in sha Allah, with pointing this out on these occasions, or reminding others of that and encouraging them to do it.\nFor more details, please refer to the following answers: 220647 , 202017 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/272580/is-it-sunnah-to-ask-for-forgiveness-before-ramadan
