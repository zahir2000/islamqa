417506,"What is the ruling on participating in building a school with a real estate investor by means of a share system, in which the profits are a percentage of the value of the shares and will increase with time to reach the maximum amount in the fourth year?","['Praise be to Allah.It is permissible for a group of people to participate with a real estate investor to build a private school by means of a share system, but the profit must be a known percentage of the total profit, such as 50% of the profit, for example, going to the real estate investor and 50% going to the shareholders, to be distributed among them according to the number of shares each of them holds. It is not permissible for the profit on the shares to be a percentage of the value of the shares, because that is like stipulating a certain amount of money [as profit], which is not permissible in any partnership.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If the share of one of the partners is defined as a known amount of money, or he will receive in addition to his share of the profit a specific amount of money, such as stipulating that he will have his percentage of the profit plus ten dirhams, the partnership is rendered invalid.\nIbn al-Mundhir said: All of the scholars from whom we acquired knowledge are unanimously agreed that a profit-sharing partnership is rendered invalid if one or both of the partners stipulate that he will receive a known amount of money. Those from whom we learned that include Malik, al-Awza‘i, ash-Shafa‘i, Abu Thawr and ashab ar-ra’y.""(Al-Mughni\xa0 5/23).\nIn al-Ma‘ayir al-Shar‘iyyah (p. 198) it says: It is not permissible for the conditions or bylaws of a partnership governing the distribution of profits to include any clause that leads to the possibility of putting a stop to the sharing of the profits. If there is any such clause, then the contract is invalid. It is not permissible for one of the partners to stipulate that he will receive a specific amount of the profits or a percentage of the capital.

427817,When were Surat al-Falaq and Surat an-Nas revealed? Is the hadith about the eleven knots which were tied to bewitch the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) sahih?,"['Praise be to Allah.The hadiths indicate that the Mu‘awwidhatayn (Al-Falaq) and An-Nas) were revealed in Madinah.\nThis is mentioned in the hadith of ‘Uqbah ibn ‘Amir, who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Do you not see verses that have been revealed tonight, the like of which has never been seen? {Say, ""I seek refuge in the Lord of daybreak} [Al-Falaq 113] and {Say, ""I seek refuge in the Lord of mankind} [An-Nas 114].”\n‘Uqbah ibn ‘Amir (may Allah be pleased with him) accompanied the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in Madinah, and these two surahs were revealed after the bewitching incident.\n‘Abd ibn Humayd narrated in al-Muntakhab (1/228): Ahmad ibn Yunus told me: Abu Mu‘awiyah told us, from al-A‘mash, from Yazid ibn Hayyan, from Zayd ibn Arqam, who said: A Jewish man bewitched the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and he fell sick. Jibril came to him, bringing down al-Mu‘awwidhatayn, and said: A Jewish man has bewitched you, and the item used for witchcraft is in the well of So-and-so. So he sent ‘Ali, who brought it to him, then he instructed him to untie the knots and recite verses, so he started reciting and untying, until the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) got up as if he had been released from restraints. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not say anything to that Jewish man about what he had done to him, and he never confronted him with it.\nThe narrators of this isnad are trustworthy (thiqat); it was classed as sahih by the commentators on the book, and by Shaykh al-Albani in as-SIlsilah as-Sahihah (6/617).\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar said:\nHe said: Because of that, al-Mu‘aawidhatayn were revealed. End quote.\nThis was narrated by ath-Tha‘labi from Ibn ‘Abbas in a mu‘allaq report, and from ‘A’ishah, also in a mu‘allaq report.\nThe isnad going back to ‘A’ishah is sahih. It was narrated by Sufyan ibn ‘Uyaynah in his Tafsir from Abu ‘Ubaydillah, from Hisham ibn ‘Urwah, from his father, from ‘A’ishah. In it, it says: And {Qul a‘udhu bi Rabb il-falaq} [Surat al-Falaq] was revealed.""(At-Talkhis al-Habir\xa0 6/2689).\nAs for the number of knots being eleven, no sahih hadith has been narrated concerning that.\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAs-Suhayli stated that the number of knots was eleven, so it was appropriate that the number of verses of the Mu‘awwidhatayn should be eleven, so that with every verse, one knot was undone.\nI say: al-Bayhaqi narrated in ad-Dala’il something similar with a da‘if isnad, in the story in which it is said that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was bewitched… At the end of the hadith, it says that they found a string in which there were eleven knots, and Surat al-Falaq and Surat an-Nas were revealed, so every time he recited a verse, one knot came undone.\nIbn Sa‘d narrated with a munqati‘ (interrupted) isnad from Ibn ‘Abbas that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) sent ‘Ali and ‘Ammar, and they found a string in which there were eleven knots, and he mentioned a similar report.""(At-Talkhis al-Habir\xa06/2689-2690).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/427817/when-were-surat-al-falaq-and-surat-an-nas-revealed
