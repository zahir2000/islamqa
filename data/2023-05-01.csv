232245,"If someone treated his parents badly, then realised his mistake after they died, what should he do so that he might be forgiven?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nDisobedience towards parents is a major sin.\nIt was narrated from ‘Abd ar-Rahman ibn Abi Bakrah that his father (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) said: “Shall I not tell you of the greatest of major sins?” We said: Yes indeed, O Messenger of Allah. He said: “Associating others with Allah (shirk) and disobedience towards parents.” He was reclining, but then he sat up and said, “And – indeed – false speech and false testimony, and – indeed – false speech and false testimony,” and he kept on saying it until I thought he would never stop.\xa0\n(Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5631; Muslim, 87).\xa0\nIt was narrated from ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr, that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The major sins are: associating others with Allah, mistreatment of parents, murder and al-yamin al-ghamus\xa0[an oath which will cause a person to be dipped in the hellfire, that is, a false oath that is sworn knowingly]. Narrated by al-Bukhari (6675).\nMistreatment of parents refers to that which the son does or says – without any shar‘i justification –that causes hurt to his parents.\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: What is meant by mistreatment of parents is any word or deed\xa0 on the part of the son which causes hurt to the father, except in the case where he instructs him to associate something with Allah or commit sin.""(Fath al-Bari\xa0 10/406).\nSecondly:\nOne of the important issues of Islamic belief (‘aqidah) that the Muslim should understand, believe in, and act in accordance with is that it is possible to repent from any sin, no matter how great.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Say, “O My servants who have transgressed against themselves [by sinning], do not despair of the mercy of Allah . Indeed, Allah forgives all sins. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful.”}\xa0[az-Zumar 39:53].\nSo all this person who mistreated his parents has to do now is hasten to repent, for Allah, may He be exalted, has promised to accept the repentance of the one who repents. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And it is He who accepts repentance from His servants and pardons misdeeds, and He knows what you do}\xa0[ash-Shura 42:25].\nIn order for his repentance to be sincere and accepted, it is essential to fulfil the conditions thereof.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe scholars said: Repentance from every sin is essential. If it is something between a person and Allah, may He be exalted, and has nothing to do with the rights of another person, there are three conditions of repentance:\xa0\n\nHe should give up the sin\nHe should regret having done it\nHe should resolve never to go back to it.\n\nIf one of these three is missing, then his repentance is not sincere.""(Riyadh as-Salihin\xa0 p. 14).\nBut one may raise the issue that some of these conditions cannot be fulfilled after the death of the parents.\nThe response to that is twofold:\nThe first point is that in such a case, regret alone is repentance.\nIt was narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn Ma‘qil ibn Muqarrin said: I went with my father to visit ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud, and I heard him say: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Regret is repentance.” Narrated by Ibn Majah (4252) and Ahmad (6/37); classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Sunan Ibn Majah.\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nOne of the rulings on repentance is that if the sinner no longer has the means of committing the sin and it is now beyond him, meaning that it is impossible for him to do it, is repentance valid? Examples of that include the liar, the slanderer and the one who gives false testimony, if their tongues are cut out… And the one who reaches a state where he no longer has any motive to commit a sin that he used to commit.\nConcerning that there are two scholarly views…\nThe second view – which is the correct view – is that it is possible for him to repent sincerely, because the only elements of repentance that is possible in his case is regret. In al-Musnad it is narrated with a marfu‘ isnad that “Regret is repentance.” So if he truly regrets the sin, and blames himself for it, then this is repentance. How can it be truly said that he cannot repent, when he greatly regrets the sin and blames himself for it?\nMadarij as-Salikin (1/741-746).\nThis is the view of the majority of scholars. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe repentance of one who is unable to act - such as the repentance of the one whose penis has been cut off from zina, and the repentance of the one whose hand has been cut off and he is no longer able to steal, and others who are similarly incapacitated and can no longer commit the sin in question – is valid and acceptable according to the majority of scholars among Ahl as-Sunnah and others.""(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa\xa010/746).\nThe second point is that by Allah’s mercy towards the Muslims, He has ordained that the door of reward for honouring parents is not closed when they die, so the son who had fallen short can strive to do whatever he is able to do of honouring them.\nThe ways of honouring parents after their death include the following:\n1. Offering a great deal of supplication (du ‘a’) for them.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{ and say, “My Lord, have mercy upon them as they brought me up [when I was] small”}\xa0[al-Isra’ 17:24].\nIt was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When a man dies, all his good deeds come to an end except three: ongoing charity (sadaqah jaariyah), beneficial knowledge, or a righteous son who will pray for him.” Narrated by Muslim (1631).\nThis supplication is one of the greatest ways of showing kindness to parents.\nIt was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “A man will be raised in status in Paradise and will say, ‘Where did this come from?’ And it will be said: ‘From your son’s praying for forgiveness for you.’”\nNarrated by Ibn Majah (3660); classed as hasan by al-Albani in as-Silsilah as-Sahihah (4/129).\n2. Doing righteous deeds so that the reward thereof will reach them\nsuch as giving charity on their behalf. Please see the answer to question no. 218872 .\nOr doing Hajj and ‘umrah on their behalf. For more information on the guidelines and rulings on doing Hajj on behalf of someone else, please see the answer to question no. 111794 .\nIf they had left behind any debts or things that had been entrusted to them, then the son should strive hard to pay them off on their behalf. Or if they had wronged any people, he should ask those who were wronged to pardon them and he should seek to settle the matter with them.\n3. Honouring their friends and loved ones.\nIt was narrated from ‘Abdullah ibn Dinar, from Ibn ‘Umar, that when Ibn ‘Umar set out for Makkah, he had a donkey with him that he would ride for a change when he tired of riding his camel, and he had a turban that he wrapped around his head. One day whilst he was riding that donkey, a Bedouin passed by him and he said: Aren’t you So and so the son of So and so? He said: Yes. He gave him the donkey and said: Ride this, and he gave him the turban and said: Wrap this around your head. Some of his companions said to him: May Allah forgive you, you have given this Bedouin a donkey that you were riding for a change and a turban that you had wrapped around your head. He said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “One of the best acts of righteousness is for a man to uphold ties with the friends of his father after he (the father) dies.” And his father was a friend of ‘Umar’s.\nNarrated by Muslim (2552).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/232245/he-mistreated-his-parents-and-regretted-it-after-they-died-what-should-he-do
194998,"How can we reconcile the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) – “Whoever says in the morning and in the evening: ‘Subhan Allahi wa bi hamdih (Glory and praise be to Allah)’ one hundred times, no one will come on the Day of Resurrection with anything better than what he has done, except one who said something like what he said, or more than that” narrated by Muslim (2692) – and question no. 148699 , in which it says that nothing should be added to the number of times for reciting adhkar as mentioned in the hadiths?","['Praise be to Allah.Dhikr (remembering Allah) is of two types: unrestricted dhikr and restricted dhikr. Both types of dhikr are mentioned in the verses in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{O you who have believed, remember Allah with much remembrance,\nAnd exalt Him morning and afternoon}\xa0[al-Ahzab 33:41-42]\n{ And remember your Lord much and exalt [Him with praise] in the evening and the morning }\xa0[Al ‘Imran 3:41].\nUnrestricted dhikr is dhikr that is not connected to a particular time, place or situation; rather a person may remember his Lord by reciting such dhikr in all situations, as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to do. Muslim (373) narrated that ‘A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to remember Allah in all situations.\nReciting this type of dhikr a great deal is encouraged in Islamic teachings. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{and the men who remember Allah often and the women who do so - for them Allah has prepared forgiveness and a great reward}\xa0[al-Ahzab 33:35]\n{ and remember Allah much that you may be successful}\xa0[al-Anfal 8:45].\nMuslim (2676) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was travelling on the road to Makkah, and he passed by a mountain called Jumdan. He said: “Proceed, this is Jumdan; those who have distinguished themselves [from others, by focusing on constant dhikr] have gone on ahead.” They said: Who are those who have distinguished themselves, O Messenger of Allah? He said: “{the men who remember Allah often and the women who do so}.”\nAs for restricted dhikr, this is dhikr that is connected to a particular time, place or situation, or is to be recited in certain words and a certain number of times. The basic principle with regard to this type of dhikr is that one should adhere to what is mentioned in the hadiths.\nAn example of this type is the adhkar that are to be recited following the prayers, the adhkar to be recited before going to sleep, the adhkar to be recited in the morning and the evening, and other restricted adhkar. These are to be done as described in the hadiths, in terms of the wording and the number of times they are to be repeated.\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: From this it may be understood that paying attention to the specific number of times adhkar are to be recited is important, otherwise it could be said: add to it tahlil [saying “La ilaha ill-Allah (there is no god worthy of worship except Allah)”] thirty-three times. Some of the scholars said – with regard to the number of times mentioned in the hadiths, as in the case of the dhikr to be recited following the prayers – that if the hadith mentions a particular number for which there is a specific reward, if the one who is reciting it adds to the number mentioned, he will not attain that specific reward, because of the possibility that there is some special wisdom behind that, that may be missed by going beyond that number… End quote from Fath al-Bari by Ibn Hajar (2/330).\nIt says in Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah (24/203): With regard to the du‘a’s and adhkar that are mentioned in the hadiths, the basic principle is that they are tawqifi [i.e., they can only be known through divine Revelation and sound texts of hadeeth, with no room for ijtihad] in terms of their wording and the number of times they are to be recited, so the Muslim should pay attention to that and adhere to it, and he should not add to the number of times stated or the wording, or detract from that or deviate from it. And Allah is the source of strength. End quote.\nThe fact that he should adhere to what is narrated in the hadiths in the case of restricted dhikr is indicated by the fact that there is no report from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to suggest that he added to the wording of some adhkar, such as the adhkar following the prayer, for example. Rather, when the poor Muhajirin complained to him that the rich ones had also started to recite the adhkar following the prayer, he did not instruct them to add anything to the number of times that they are to be repeated (thirty-three). Rather he said: “That is the bounty of Allah which he bestows upon whomever He wills.” This indicates that this dhikr is restricted to a particular number.\nRegarding the answer about the hadith in which it says “Whoever says in the morning and in the evening: ‘Subhan Allahi wa bi hamdih (Glory and praise be to Allah)’ one hundred times, no one will come on the Day of Resurrection with anything better than what he has done, except one who said something like what he said, or more than that,” it may be noted that it is possible that what is meant by “more than that” is more of the same type of dhikr, in which case this is an exception which allows adding more to what is mentioned in this hadith, or it may be that what is meant by “more than that” is adding more dhikr in general terms, in which case what is meant is that he recites the dhikr mentioned in this hadith and adds to it another type of dhikr.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The Prophet’s words, “Whoever says ‘La ilaha ill-Allah wahdahu la sharika lah, lahu’l-mulk wa lahu’l-hamd wa huwa ‘ala kulli shay’in qadir (there is no god worthy of worship except Allah alone, with no partner or associate. His is the Dominion and to Him be praise, and He is able to do all things)’ one hundred times in a day, … no one can do anything better than what he has done except one who does more than that” indicate that if someone were to recite this dhikr more than one hundred times in a day, he will have the reward for one hundred times that is mentioned in the hadith, and will have a another reward for what he recites in addition to that, and this does not come under the heading of limits that are not to be exceeded, in which there is no virtue in adding to it and it could even invalidate it, as is the case if one adds to the number of times that limbs are to be washed when doing wudu’ or adding to the number of rak‘ahs in the prayer.\nIt may be that what is meant is doing more righteous deeds, not reciting more of the same dhikr, or it may be that what is meant is adding anything of any nature, where it is adding more of the same type of dhikr or other types of righteous deeds, or adding more of the same type of dhikr and other types of righteous deeds. The latter is more likely to be the case. And Allah knows best.""(Sharh Muslim by an-Nawawi\xa0 17/17).\nConclusion: Dhikr it is of two types: unrestricted and restricted. In the case of that which is unrestricted, there is no specific number of times for repeating phrases; rather the individual may remember his Lord as much as he is able to. In the case of that which is restricted, the basic principle is that the individual should adhere to what has been narrated in the religious hadiths in terms of wording and number of repetitions, except when the text indicates that he may add to what is mentioned in the hadith, as in the case of saying “Subhan Allahi wa bi hamdih (Glory and praise be to Allah)” and “La ilaha ill-Allah wahdahu la sharika lah, lahu’l-mulk wa lahu’l-hamd wa huwa ‘ala kulli shay’in qadir (there is no god worthy of worship except Allah alone, with no partner or associate. His is the Dominion and to Him be praise, and He is able to do all things).” In that case, if he adds more than one hundred, there is nothing wrong with that.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/194998/what-is-the-ruling-on-adding-to-the-number-of-times-for-reciting-adhkar-as-mentioned-in-the-hadiths
