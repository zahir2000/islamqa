398094,"Nowadays there is something that is called environmentally-friendly burial (“green” or “natural” burial that allows the body to decompose naturally, or “tree pod burial”). The way in which this burial is done is by placing the person in a biodegradable pod. The body is placed in the foetal position inside the pod, which is then buried in the ground and a small tree, chosen by the deceased or his relatives, is planted above the pod. What is meant is that this will be a new life for a soul by planting the tree, or a revival or bringing his life back. Usually the tree is of a long-lived variety, which with the passage of time will spread widely. What is the ruling on that?","['Praise be to Allah.With regard to the method of burial described in the question, and planting a tree as mentioned, none of that is permissible, because of what it involves of innovated ideas and introducing new things. Allah, may He be exalted, has prescribed that bodies are to be buried in the ground. This is what His prophets and messengers did, and no attention is to be paid to anyone who claims that this is harmful to the environment.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{From the earth We created you, and into it We will return you, and from it We will extract you another time}\xa0[Ta-Ha 20:55]\n{Have We not made the earth a container,\nOf the living and the dead?}\xa0[al-Mursalat 77:25-26].\nAl-Baghawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his Tafsir (8/305): {a container [kifat]} is a vessel. What is meant by the root word al-kaft is bringing something together. Al-Farra’ said: What is meant is bringing the living together on the surface of the earth in their houses and homes, and bringing the dead together under the surface; in other words, containing them. End quote.\nAbu Dawud (3208), an-Nasa’i (2009), at-Tirmidhi (1045) and Ibn Majah (1554) narrated that Ibn ‘Abbas said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The niche (lahd) is for us and the trench (shaqq) in the ground is for others.”\nIt was also narrated by Ahmad (19158) from Jarir ibn ‘Abdillah al-Bajali; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud.\nThe lahd (niche) and shaqq (trench) are both in the ground, but the lahd is in the side of the grave. See the answer to question no. 103880 .\nSecondly:\nIt is not prescribed to plant trees on graves.\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is not prescribed to plant trees on graves, whether Indian figs or any other kind, or to sow barley or wheat or anything else on them, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not do that with graves, and neither did the Rightly-Guided Caliphs who succeeded him (may Allah be pleased with them).\nWith regard to what he did with the two graves when Allah informed him of the torment of their occupants, and he placed a palm branch on them, this is something that was only for those two graves, because he did not do that with any other graves.\nThe Muslims have no right to introduce any acts of worship or rituals that Allah has not prescribed, because of the hadiths quoted above, and because Allah, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Or have they other deities who have ordained for them a religion to which Allah has not consented?}\xa0[ash-Shura 42:21].""(Majmu‘ Fatawa ash-Shaykh Ibn Baz\xa0 5/407).\nAnd he (may Allah have mercy on him) said: That is not prescribed, rather it is an innovation, because the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) only put the palm branch on the two graves when Allah, may He be glorified, informed him of the torment being suffered by their occupants, and he did not place palm branches on any other graves. Thus it is known that it is not permissible to place them on graves, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever introduces anything into this matter of ours that is not part of it, it will be rejected.” According to a version narrated by Muslim: “Whoever does a deed that is not in accordance with this matter of ours, it will be rejected.”\nSimilarly, it is not permissible to write on graves, or to place flowers on them, because of the two hadiths quoted above. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade plastering over graves, building structures over them, sitting on them and writing on them.""(Majallat al-Buhooth al-Islamiyyah\xa0 68/50).\nThis is in addition to the fact that the tree mentioned is not planted on the grave itself, and is not connected to the body of the deceased; rather the trees are planted between the graves, or the palm branches are placed on the graves; in either case, they are not connected to the body of the deceased person in his grave.\nAs for the way of planting trees that is mentioned, and saying or believing that this will be a new life for a soul by planting the tree, or a revival or bringing his life back, all of that is the misguidance of the people of ignorance, and it is more akin to deviant belief in the transmigration of souls. When life departs from a person, it will never come back to him until Allah resurrects those who are in the graves. His soul does not go to a tree or to an animal; rather the soul is with its Creator, Who will place it wherever He wills. It will not return to another body or to an animal or to a tree, according to the consensus of the Muslim scholars; rather those who say this and similar things are deviant people who believe in the transmigration of souls, and those who are influenced by them.\nFor more information, please see the answer\xa0to question\xa0no. 14379 \xa0.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/398094/what-is-the-ruling-on-environmentally-friendly-burial-tree-pod-burial
34744,"I am going to Makkah to do `Umrah, but I do not know any Du`as. Can you help me?","['Praise be to Allah.There are Du`as and Adhkar \xa0 narrated in the authentic Sunnah which you can recite during the rituals of `Umrah , and from which the Muslim can benefit by memorizing them, understanding them and acting upon them. These include the following:\xa0\nDu`a\xa0 at the Miqat\xa0\nIt is Sunnah for the Muslim to recite Tasbih (saying “Subhan-Allah (glory be to Allah)”), Tahlil (saying “La ilaha illallah (there is none worthy of worship but Allah)”) and Takbir (saying “Allahu akbar (Allah is Most Great)”) before entering Ihram for `Umrah or Hajj.\xa0\nIt was narrated that Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prayed Dhuhr with four Rak`ahs when we were with him in Madinah, and he prayed `Asr in Dhu`l-Hulayfah with two Rak`ahs, then he stayed there overnight. When morning came he rode until he reached Al-Bayda’, then he praised, glorified and magnified Allah. Then he recited Talbiyah with the intention of performing Hajj and `Umrah and the people did likewise.\xa0(Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 1476)\xa0\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“This ruling – that it is recommended to recite Tasbih and the other (Adhkars) mentioned before Ihram – is something that not many people do even though it is proven in the Sunnah.” (Fat-h Al-Bari, 3/412)\xa0\nDu`a\xa0 on the way to Makkah\xa0\nIt is Sunnah to recite the Talbiyah a great deal and to raise one`s voice – for men; women should recite in a low voice so that no non-Mahram men will hear them.\xa0\nIt was narrated from `Abdullah ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that when the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) set out riding from the mosque of Dhul-Hulayfah, he recited the Talbiyah and said: “Labbayk Allahumma labbayk , labbayka la sharika laka labbayk, inna Al-hamda wa`l-ni`matah laka wal-mulk, la sharika lak (Here I am, O Allah, in response to your call, here I am. Here I am, in response to your call, You have no partner, here I am. Verily all praise and grace and dominion are Yours, You have no partner).”\xa0(Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 5571 and Muslim, 1184)\xa0\nDu`a during Tawaf\xa0\nEvery time you come in line with the Black Stone in each circuit, say, “Allahu akbar.” Al-Bukhari (1613) narrated from Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) circumambulated the House, and every time he came to the corner (i.e., the Black Stone), he pointed to it with something he had in his hand and said Takbir .\xa0\nBetween the Yemeni Corner and the Black Stone you should say the words that were narrated from `Abdullah ibn As-Sa’ib (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say between the two Corners: “Rabbana atina fid-dunya hasanah wa fil-akhirah hasanah wa qina `adhab An-nar (Our Lord, give us that which is good in this world and that which is good in the Hereafter, and protect us from the torment of the Fire).” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 1892; classed as sound by Shaykh Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud)\xa0\nDu`a before climbing up As-Safa and when atop it\xa0\nIt was narrated that Jabir ibn `Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: … then he (the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)) went out through the gate to As-Safa and when he drew near to As-Safa he recited: “Verily, As-Safa and Al-Marwah (two mountains in Makkah) are of the Symbols of Allah” [Al-Baqarah 2:158 – interpretation of the meaning], (and he said:) “I begin with that with which Allah began.” He began with As-Safa and climbed it until he could see the House, then he turned to face the Qiblah and proclaimed the Oneness of Allah and magnified Him, and said: “La ilaha illallah wahdahu la sharika lah, lahul-mulk wa lahul-hamd wa huwa `ala kulli shay’in qadir; La ilaha illallah wahdahu anjaza wa`dah wa nasara `abdah wa hazama Al-ahzaba wahdah (There is none worthy of worship but Allah alone, with no partner or associate, His is the dominion and to Him be praise, and He is able to do all things; there is none worthy of worship but Allah alone, He fulfilled His promises and granted victory to His slave and defeated the confederates alone).” Then he made Du`a between that and repeated this three times.\xa0(Narrated by Muslim, 1218)\xa0\nDu`a when climbing Al-Marwah\xa0\nYou should do the same as you did when climbing As-Safa, without reciting the verse before starting to climb.\xa0\nJabir (may Allah be pleased with him) said:\xa0 Then he came down towards Al-Marwah and when his feet reached the bottom of the valley he ran until the ground started to rise, then he walked until he came to Al-Marwah, and he did at Al-Marwah as he had done at As-Safa. (Narrated by Muslim, 1218)\xa0\nWhen drinking Zamzam water, you may say Du`a asking for the best of this world and the Hereafter, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The water of Zamzam is for whatever it is drunk for.” (Narrated by Ibn Majah, 3062; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in 5502)\xa0\nSimilarly it is prescribed to remember Allah a great deal (Dhikr), which includes Du`a, during Tawaf and Sa`i, so the Muslim should make Du`a as Allah inspires him. There is nothing wrong with reciting Quran during tawaf and Sa`i. What some people say, that there are special Du`as for each circuit of tawaf and Sa`i is something for which there is no basis in Shari`ah.\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“It is recommended during Tawaf to remember Allah and call upon Him in ways that are prescribed in Shari`ah. If one recites Quran there is nothing wrong with that. There is no specific Dhikr that has been narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), that he either enjoined, said or taught to others. Rather (the pilgrim) may say any Du`a that is prescribed in Shari`ah. What many people say, that there is a specific Du`a to be recited beneath the downspout of the Ka`bah and so on has no basis.\xa0\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to end his Tawaf between the two Corners by saying,\xa0 “Rabbana atina fid-dunya hasanah wa fil-akhirah hasanah wa qina `adhab An-nar (Our Lord, give us that which is good in this world and that which is good in the Hereafter, and protect us from the torment of the Fire),” as he used to finish all his Du`as with these words, and there is no specific Du`a for that, according to scholarly consensus.” (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 26/122, 123)\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34744/dua-during-umrah
109320,Is it permissible for us to separate Tawaf and Sa`i by two hours or more and do Sa`i after that?,"['Praise be to Allah.Yes, there is nothing wrong with delaying Sa`i after Tawaf , although it is better to do Sa`i straight after Tawaf .\xa0\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Mughni (10/240):\xa0\n“It is not obligatory to do Sa`i immediately after Tawaf .\xa0\nImam Ahmad said: There is nothing wrong with delaying Sa`i until one has rested or until evening.\xa0\n`Ata’ and Al-Hasan did not see anything wrong with the one who had circumambulated the Ka`bah at the beginning of the day delaying As-Safa and Al-Marwah until evening. This was done by Al-Qasim and Sa`id ibn Jubayr.”\xa0\nIt says in Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah:\xa0\n“The Sunnah is that Sa`i should be connected to Tawaf as much as possible, but if one delays Sa`i a great deal and then does it, that is valid.\xa0\nAnd Allah is the Source of strength. May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.” (Shaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn Baz, Shaykh `Abd Ar-Razzaq `Afifi, Shaykh `Abdullah ibn Qu`ud.\xa0Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah lil-Buhuth Al-`Ilmiyyah wal-Ifta, 11/263)\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“It is not essential that Tawaf and Sa`i be done one after the other, even if there is no reason for that, so if a person does Tawaf at the beginning of the day and Sa`i at the end, there is nothing wrong with that, or if he does Tawaf at the beginning of the night and Sa`i during the day, there is nothing wrong with that, because doing Tawaf and Sa`i one after the other is Sunnah, not obligatory.” (Majmu` Fatawa Ibn `Uthaymin, 23/201)\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/109320/can-you-take-a-break-between-tawaf-and-sai
