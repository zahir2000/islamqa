301735,In which area of Makkah did the birds (Ababil) throw stone on the army of Abraha?,"['Praise be to Allah.Abrahah made preparations to enter Makkah; he mobilised his army and prepared his elephant. Then when he was in Wadi Muhassir, between Muzdalifah and Mina, the elephant knelt down and would not get up to advance towards the Ka‘bah.\nIt was said that when they made the elephant face towards Makkah, Nufayl ibn Habib al-Khath‘ami came up to the elephant and stood beside it, then he took hold of its ear and said: Sit down, Mahmoud, for you are in the sacred land of Allah. Then he let go of its ear, and the elephant knelt down. Nufayl left, running up to the top of the mountain. They beat the elephant to make it stand up, but it refused. So they struck its head to make it stand up, and it refused. They turned it around as if to go back to Yemen, and it got up and ran in that direction. They turned it to face towards Syria, and it did the same thing; they turned it to face towards the east, and it did the same thing; but when they turned it to face towards Makkah, it knelt down.\nWhilst they were like that, Allah, may He be exalted, sent against them birds in flocks from the sea. Each bird was carrying three stones, one in its beak and one in each of its feet; the size of the stones was like the size of chickpeas or lentils. None of the army were struck but his limbs were cut off and he died, but not all of them were struck; those who were spared fled, rushing towards the road by which they had come.\nSee: al-Lu’lu’ al-Maknun by al-‘Azimi (1/61).\nAs-Salihi said: When the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came to the bottom of Wadi Muhassir, he made his she-camel speed up and run quickly. This was his habit in places where the punishment of Allah had come down upon His enemies, and that was the place where there happened to the people of the elephant that which Allah has told us about.\nHence that wadi was called Wadi Muhassir, because the elephant halted (hasara) there and did not proceed any further.\nMuhassir is an area between Mina and Muzdalifah; it does not belong to either of them.""(Subul al-Huda wa’r-Rashad\xa0 8/474).\nAl-Fayyumi said: Wadi Muhassir is between Mina and Muzdalifah.\nIt is named thus because the elephant of Abrahah grew tired there and could not proceed any further, which caused sorrow (hasarat) to its owners.""(Al-Misbah al-Munir\xa0 1/135).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/301735/in-what-area-of-makkah-did-the-birds-ababil-throw-stones-on-the-army-of-abrahah
128850,"Is it permissible for me, as a Muslim, to read the Gospel out of curiosity, and not for any other purpose? Does believing in the divinely-revealed books mean believing that they are from Allah, or believing in what it says in them?","['Praise be to Allah.Belief in Divinely-revealed Books\nShaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said.\n“Every Muslim is required to believe in the Torah, Gospel and Zabur , and that they came from Allah. So he must believe that Allah sent down the Books to the Prophets , and that He sent to them scriptures that contained commands and prohibitions, exhortation and reminders, and spoke of matters of the past, of Paradise and Hell, and so on. But he should not follow them, because they have been affected by distortion, alterations and changes.\xa0\nSo he should not keep copies of the Torah, Gospel or Zabur, or read them , because this is dangerous, for he may end up disbelieving in something that is true or believing something that is false, because these books have been distorted and changed.\xa0\nThe Jews, Christians and others have altered them , distorted them and changed the order of material in these books. We have no need of them because of what Allah has given us of our own book, the Glorious Quran.\nIt was narrated from the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that he saw part of the Torah in the hand of `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him); he became angry and said: “Are you in doubt, O son of Al-Khattab? I have brought to you a message that is bright and pure, and if Musa were alive he would have no choice but to follow me.”\nIs it prohibited to read the Bible?\nThe point is that we advise you and others not to take anything from either the Torah or the Zabur or the Gospel, and not to keep any of these books. Rather if you have any of these things, then you should bury it or burn it, for the changes and alterations that have been introduced to them are evil and false . What is required of the believer is to avoid that and to beware of looking at it, for perhaps he may end up believing something that is false or disbelieving something that is true. The way to be safe from that is either to bury it or burn it.\nIt is permissible for a scholar who has insight to read it in order to refute\xa0Jewish and Christian opponents of Islam, as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) called for the Torah when the Jews denied the punishment of stoning, so that he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) could have it checked, after which they admitted [that the punishment of stoning is mentioned in the Torah].\nThe point is that the scholars who are well versed in Islamic teachings may need to look at the Torah or Gospel or Zabur for Islamic purposes, such as refuting the enemies of Allah, or to highlight the virtue of the Quran and what it contains of truth and guidance.\xa0\nAs for ordinary Muslims, they have no right to do that; rather if they have anything of the Torah or Gospel or Zabur, they must bury it in a clean place or burn it so that no one will be misguided by it.” (Fatawa Nur `ala Ad-Darb, 1/9-10)\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/128850/is-it-prohibited-to-read-the-bible

192665,What is the ruling on offering congratulations for `Eid one or two days before it begins?,"['Praise be to Allah.Is saying `Eid Mubarak Bi`dah?\nOffering congratulations for `Eid is something that is permissible ; that was narrated from some of the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them).\xa0\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Ibn `Aqil quoted some Hadiths about offering congratulations on `Eid , including the report that Muhammad ibn Ziyad said: I was with Abu Umamah Al-Bahili and some of the other companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him); when they went back from `Eid (prayer), they would say to one another: May Allah accept from us and from you. Ahmad said: The chain of narration of the Hadith of Abu Umamah is good.” (Al-Mughni, 2/130)\xa0\nWhen should you say `Eid Mubarak?\nWhat appears to be the case from the actions of the Companions and what has been narrated from them is that offering congratulations for `Eid should come after the `Eid prayer . So if a person limits it to that, that is good, as it is following the example of the Companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). But if he offers such congratulations before that, to be the first to give this greeting to his friend, it seems that there is nothing wrong with that, because offering congratulations for `Eid comes under the heading of customs and traditions, and such matters are broad in scope and should be referred to the customs that are prevalent among the people.\xa0\nAsh-Shirwani Ash-Shafi`i (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “From his words it may be understood that on the day of `Eid , it is not required to congratulate people during the days of Tashriq or after the day of `Eid Al-Fitr; rather it has become customary among people to offer congratulations on these days, and there is no reason not to do so, because the aim behind it is to create feelings of friendship and express joy. It may also be understood from his mentioning the day of `Eid\xa0 that the time for offering congratulations begins at Fajr, not the night before, even though there are other views, as mentioned in some commentaries. It may be said that there is nothing wrong with doing it if that is the custom, because of what he mentioned about the aims behind it, namely to create feelings of friendship and express joy. This is supported by the fact that it is recommended to say Takbir on the night before `Eid .” (Hawashi Ash-Shirwani `ala Tuhfat Al-Muhtaj, 2/57)\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/192665/when-should-you-say-eid-mubarak
