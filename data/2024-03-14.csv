442021,"If there is no intention of divorce, divorce in writing is not valid. Does the same apply in the case of zihar, khul', li'aan and faskh, and other such matters? explain","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nDivorce through writing, without verbal expression, does not occur except with\xa0intention;because it is a form of indirect expressions of divorce, and is not considered explicit.\nPlease refer to\xa0the answer to question no. 70460\nSecondly:\nZihar (a form of divorce) through writing also does not occur except with\xa0intention, similar to written divorce.\nIt is stated in Al-Hawi Al-Kabir (10/169): ""As for Zihar through writing: it is like divorce according in that there are two opinions.\nAs for Ila\' (oath of abstinence) through writing: it is not valid, unanimously; because Ila\' is an oath by Allah the Exalted and does not take effect through indirect expressions.""

End quote.\nAs for annulment, it is a ruling that is a result of matters such as defects, the conversion of one of the spouses to Islam, and non-fulfillment of a condition in the marriage contract.\nFourthly:\nLi`an (oath of condemnation) is not valid in writing; because it is an oath by Allah; thus, it does not take effect through indirect expressions, as previously mentioned about Ila\' in Al-Hawi.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/442021/written-khul-and-dhihar
11798,"I know when getting married a person needs their parents blessing and consent but what if married couples are separated and are considering returning to each other, do they still need their parents blessing all over again?","['Praise be to Allah.If a man divorces his wife and this is the first or second pronouncement of divorce and she has not ended her `iddah (by giving birth if she is pregnant or by the passage of three menstrual cycles if she is not pregnant), then he can take his wife back by saying, “I am taking you back” or “I am keeping you.” Then his taking her back is valid. Or he may do some action intending thereby to take her back, such as having intercourse with the intention of taking her back.\xa0\nThe Sunnah is to have two witnesses to the fact that he has taken her back , so that two witnesses testify to that, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Then when they are about to attain their term appointed, either take them back in a good manner or part with them in a good manner. And take as witness two just persons from among you (Muslims).” [At-Talaq 65:2]\nIn this manner a man may take his wife back.\xa0\nBut if the `Iddah has ended following a first or second pronouncement of divorce, then there has to be a new marriage contract. In this case, he has to propose marriage like any other man, to her guardian and to her.\xa0\nWhen she and her guardian agree and they agree upon a Mahr, then the marriage contract is completed. That must be done in the presence of two just witnesses.\xa0\nBut if the divorce is the final – i.e., third – divorce, then she becomes prohibited for him until another man has married her , because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And if he has divorced her (the third time), then she is not lawful unto him thereafter until she has married another husband.” [Al-Baqarah 2:230]\nSo it is not permissible for him to marry her unless she has been married to another man and the marriage has been consummated, then he leaves her either through death or divorce. This marriage must be a legitimate Shar`i marriage; if she marries him just to make it permissible for her to go back to her first husband, that is not permitted and she does not become permissible (to the first husband).\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11798/how-to-take-back-your-wife-after-divorce
6533,My question is that: how soon after having sex should a bath be taken? We have heard that everything you do before having a bath like walking or cooking is haram. Is it OK to take a bath before your next prayer?,"['Praise be to Allah.Should we bathe immediately after sex?\nThere is no set time limit within which a woman who is in a state of major ritual impurity has to do Ghusl . It has to do with the performance of prayers and other acts of worship where purity is required.\xa0\nCan you delay Ghusl until the time for the next prayer?\nThere is no harm in delaying Ghusl until the time for the next prayer comes, so long as the prayer before it has been performed in a state of purity. But it is recommended for the Muslim to hasten to do Ghusl so that he will always be in a state of purity, as is the Sunnah, and because the angels do not come near a person who is in a state of major ritual impurity.\xa0\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There are three things which the angels do not approach: the dead body of a disbeliever, a man who has perfumed himself with saffron (because this is frivolous and foolish behaviour, and is an imitation of women – Qayd al-Qadir, 3/325), and a person who is in a state of major ritual impurity, until he does Ghusl.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 4180; classed as sahih by Al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud, 3522).\nIf a woman is busy and it is not easy for her to do Ghusl from major ritual impurity straight after intercourse, this does not affect her and she is not impure. It is sufficient for her to do Wudu, to reduce the major ritual impurity and so that the angels will come near her.\nCan women who are in a state of major ritual impurity cook or touch things?\nThe claim that some people make, that it is prohibited for a woman who is in a state of major ritual impurity to touch things and to do certain things , is all innovated (Bid`ah) and false ideas which have no basis in Islam. This false belief is based on false and fabricated Hadiths that have been narrated on this topic.\xa0\nShaykh Ash-Shuqairi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Among these false ideas is the notion that if a woman who is in a state of major ritual impurity kneads dough, it becomes corrupt because of her major impurity, and that the blessing will vanish from everything her hand touches.” (As-Sunan wal Mubtada`at, p. 31)\nA similar question was submitted to Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah wal Buhuth. (5/318 – Al-Fatawa). The text of their response is as follows:\n“Praise be to Allah Alone, and blessings and peace be upon His Messenger and his family and Companions.\nYes, it is permissible for a person – whether a man or a woman – who is in a state of major ritual impurity to touch things such as clothes, plates, pots, etc., before doing Ghusl, because this person is not impure and does not make the things he or she touches impure.\xa0\nIt was reported in an authentic Hadith that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) was with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) one day; then he withdrew from him, then he came back. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to him: “Where were you, O Abu Hurayrah?” He said, “I was in a state of major ritual impurity and I did not want to sit with you when I was not pure.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Subhan Allah, a Muslim does not become impure.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 1/333)\nAnd Allah is the Source of strength. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad and his family and Companions and grant them peace.”\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 8828 , 20847 , 27091 , 6533 , and 181351 .\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/6533/can-a-woman-who-is-in-a-state-of-impurity-cook-or-touch-things
455054,"I do not smoke or vape but I do use nicotine gum as I find it to be relaxing, is this halal?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nNicotine is an organic, semi-alkaline, toxic compound and is considered one of the most harmful substances found in tobacco. .It is the substance that causes addiction in smokers\nSecondly:\nNicotine gum is a medical gum taken orally under prescription and medical supervision, providing a dose of nicotine. Its purpose is to replace the nicotine that individuals might get from smoking cigarettes or other tobacco products during withdrawal symptoms, thereby reducing their severity. While the gum contains the chemical responsible for cigarette addiction, nicotine, it does not contain other harmful substances such as tar and also does not cause intoxication. Nicotine gum works to alleviate the severity of nicotine withdrawal symptoms because it compensates the body for the nicotine that is withdrawn due to the sudden cessation of smoking.\nDespite its benefits and effectiveness in quitting smoking, incorrect use may lead to an alternative addiction to cigarette nicotine, thus entering an endless cycle of nicotine.\nNicotine gum: how to use it and how to avoid addiction to it? - At-Ta`afi Hospital (altaafi.com)\nThis gum has harmful side effects if not used under a doctor\'s supervision.\n""Some harms appear in case of incorrect use and non-adherence to the specified dose, the most prominent of which are:\n- Pain in the mouth, teeth, or jaw.\n- Feeling dizzy.\n- Nausea and vomiting.\n- Severe diarrhea.\n- Weakness and lethargy.\n- Rapid heartbeat.\n- Difficulty breathing.\n- Appearance of a skin rash.\n- Presence of blisters in the mouth."" End quote from:\nBenefits, harms, and price of nicotine gum, the easiest drug to quit smoking | Bareeq Hospital (bareeqeg.com)\nThirdly:\n\xa0If Allah has spared you from smoking, then you are bringing harm upon yourself by using this gum, and it may lead to addiction to it. The basic\xa0 principle is the prohibition of what is harmful; as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): {And do not kill yourselves [or one another]. Indeed, Allah is to you ever Merciful.} (An-Nisa\': 29), and He says (interpretation of the meaning): {And do not throw [yourselves] with your [own] hands into destruction. And do good; indeed, Allah loves the doers of good.} (Al-Baqarah: 195).\nAnd the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him)\xa0said: ""There should be neither harming nor reciprocating harm."" Narrated by Ahmad and Ibn Majah (2341) and authenticated by Al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah.\nAlso, spending a lot of money on it is considered extravagance or wastefulness, and both extravagance and wastefulness are prohibited; as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): {And eat and drink, but be not excessive. Indeed, He likes not those who commit excess.} (Al-A`raf: 31)\nAnd He dispraised wastefulness, saying (interpretation of the meaning): {And give the relative his right, and [also] the poor and the traveler, and do not spend wastefully. Indeed, the wasteful are brothers of the devils, and ever has Satan been to his Lord ungrateful.} (Al-Isra\': 26),\nEven if you adhere to a dose that does not cause harm and do not spend a lot of money on it, there is still a fear of becoming addicted to it.

47693,"I suffer from a lot of discharge, and most of what is discharged is semen (fluid usually emitted at the point of climax) which may or may not be accompanied by feelings of desire, but semen is discharged several times a day, and I do Ghusl each time.","['Praise be to Allah.Please note that if the discharge of semen is accompanied by feelings of desire, Ghusl is required according to scholarly consensus. (See Al-Majmu`, 2/111; Al-Mughni, 1/266)\nWith regard to semen being discharged without desire, the scholars differed concerning that. The most correct view is that if it is emitted without desire, Ghusl is not required but you have to do Wudu.\xa0\nThe evidence for that is the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to `Ali ibn Abu Talib (may Allah be pleased with him): “If water gushes forth then Ghusl is required.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 206; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Al-Irwa’, 125. See also Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti’, 1/278) “Gushes forth” means that it comes out forcefully, with feelings of desire.\xa0\nOne has to distinguish between the kinds of discharge that come out; not every discharge that comes out of the private part is semen for which Ghusl is required . There is Wadiy (a fluid emitted after urination), semen (fluid emitted at the point of climax) and various discharges experienced by women.\xa0\nYou have to know the difference between these and be able to distinguish between them. Madhiy and Wadiy do not necessitate Ghusl, rather what is required is to wash the private parts with water and do Wudu.\xa0\nIt is proven that `Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I was a man who used to emit a great deal of Madhiy, so I told Al-Miqdad ibn Al-Aswad to ask the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about that. He asked him and he said: `Wudu is required for that.’” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 132; Muslim, 303)\xa0\nThese discharges are not impure, but they break Wudu\nIf the emission of semen is accompanied by feelings of desire , then Ghusl is required. If it is not accompanied by feelings of desire then Ghusl is not required.\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“The difference between semen and Madhiy is that semen is thick and has a smell, and it comes out in gushes when desire intensifies. Madhiy is a thin liquid that has no smell, and it does not gush out or come out when desire intensifies, rather it comes when desire has calmed down.\xa0\nWadiy is a liquid that comes out after urinating, a few white drops that appear at the end of urination.\nThis is a description of these three things.\xa0\nWith regard to the rulings on them, Wadiy is subject to the same rulings as urine, in all aspects.\xa0\nMadhiy is somewhat different to urine with regard to purification, because it is less impure, so it is sufficient to sprinkle water on it. So one should put water on the area (of the clothes) affected, without squeezing it or rubbing it. Similarly a man should wash his entire penis and testicles even if no Madhiy got on them.\xa0\nSemen is pure and there is no need to wash what it gets onto, unless that is to remove any marks or traces, but it necessitates Ghusl . Madhiy, Wadiy and urine, on the other hand, necessitate Wudu.” (Majmu` Fatawa Ibn `Uthyamin, 11/169)\xa0\nIt seems that your situation is that of a person who is sick, so you should refer to a doctor or specialist. We ask Allah to grant you a way out from every difficulty, for He is All-Hearing, Ever Responsive.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/47693/is-ghusl-required-if-semen-is-emitted-without-desire
