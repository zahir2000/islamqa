225452,"I prayed next to someone in a mosque, and I heard him recite two of the opening supplications. Did any of the scholars say that that is permissible?","['Praise be to Allah.What appears to be the case from the Sunnah is that the worshipper should recite only one of the opening supplications.\nBukhari (744) and Muslim (597) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to remain silent between the takbir and recitation, and that period of silence was brief. I said: May my father and mother be sacrificed for you, O Messenger of Allah. When you remain silent between the takbir and recitation, what do you say? He said: “I say: Allahumma ba‘id bayni wa bayna khatayaya kama ba‘adta bayna al-mashriqi wa’l-maghrib. Allahumma naqqini min al-khataya kama yunaqqa ath-thawb al-abyad min al-danas. Allahumma ighsil khatayaya bi’l-ma’i wa’th-thalji wa’l-ma’i wa’l-barad\xa0(O Allah, put a great distance between me and my sins, as great as the distance You have made between the East and the West. O Allah, cleanse me of sin as a white garment is cleansed from filth. O Allah, wash away my sins with water and snow and hail).”\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin was asked: Can a person combine two types of the opening supplications?\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) replied: He should not combine two types of the opening supplication, because it is soundly narrated in as-Sahihayn that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: … And he quoted the hadith referred to above.\nThen he said:\nWhen someone asked the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) what he should say [in the opening supplication], he only told him of one supplication. This indicates that it is not prescribed to combine different types thereof.""(Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymin\xa0 13/122).\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe Sunnah is to vary the opening supplication. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not combine them. Sometimes he would recite the opening supplication that is narrated in the hadith of ‘Umar: “Subhanak Allahumma wa bi hamdik, wa tabarak asmuka wa ta‘ala jadduka wa la ilaha ghayruk (glory and praise be to You, O Allah, blessed be Your name, exalted be Your majesty; there is no god worthy of worship except You).” And sometimes he would recite that which is narrated in the hadith of Abu Hurayrah: “Allahumma ba‘id bayni wa bayna khatayaya… (O Allah, put a great distance between me and my sins…),” which is narrated in as-Sahihayn…""(\xa0Fatawa Nur ‘ala ad-Darb by Ibn Baz\xa0 8/172).\nSome of the scholars are of the view that there is nothing wrong with combining opening supplications in a single prayer. It says in al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (4/52):\nThe view of Abu Yusuf, the companion of Abu Hanifah, and of a number of the Shafa‘is, including Abu Ishaq al-Marwazi and al-Qadi Abu Hamid – and it is also the view favoured by al-Wazir ibn Hubayrah, who was one of the companions of Imam Ahmad – is that two of the supplication narrated in the reports may be put together: “Subhanak Allahumma wa bi hamdik… (Glory and praise be to You, O Allah…).” and “Wajjahtu wajhiya… I have set my face towards…).”\nAn-Nawawi also recommended that the opening supplications should include all the versions that have been narrated, for one who is praying on his own, and for the imam, if those who are praying behind him give him permission to do so. End quote.\nShaykh Muhammad ibn Muhammad al-Mukhtar ash-Shinqiti was asked: Is it permissible to combine the narrated versions of the opening supplication in prayer, or should the worshipper recite only one of them?\nHe (may Allah preserve him) replied:\nThe view that was favoured by a number of scholars is that he should vary it, so he should recite one supplication sometimes, and another one sometimes, because the difference here has to do with variation, and the reports do not contradict one another. Based on that, he should vary it, so he may recite one supplication in one prayer, and another supplication in another prayer, because that was the practice of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nBut if he combines all of them in one prayer, then there are two scholarly views. The first view is that favoured by Imam an-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him), which is that there is nothing wrong with putting these supplications together.\nThe other view is that favoured by Shaykh al-Islam and others, which is that there is no report which speaks of putting them together; therefore he should limit it only to what was narrated.\nWhat is better and more prudent is for the individual to limit it only to what was narrated, so he should recite one in his prayers sometimes, and recite another one in his prayers sometimes, as was narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).""(Sharh Zad al-Mustaqni‘ by Shaykh ash-Shinqiti).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/225452/did-any-of-the-scholars-say-that-it-is-permissible-to-recite-two-of-the-opening-supplications-in-prayer
224450,"I would like some information about the Islamic ruling on looking at the girl, when a young man proposes marriage: what is the ruling on that, and what has been narrated concerning it of verses and hadiths? Why was it prescribed, and what is the wisdom behind it? What should the young man ask the girl? For example: your future ambitions, your aim in life, your understanding of the concept of marriage; and various issues such as the ruling on seeing her more than once, how serious the man should be about marriage, and how long he should see her for – should it be half an hour, or an hour? What is the Islamic ruling on that? Is it permissible to do that or not, and what is permitted and what is forbidden? Can the man sit near her, and can they be next to one another? What part of her body can the woman uncover? I would like references and names of useful Islamic books that speak about this topic, even if it is only in a few chapters. And for the girl, what is required of her? Should she look natural or adorn herself lightly, without going to too much trouble or adding some cosmetic details that change her appearance?","['Praise be to Allah.The Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed the one who wants to propose marriage to a woman to look at her, and he described that as one of the means of creating affection between them.\nAt-Tirmidhi (1087) and Ibn Maajah (1865) narrated from al-Mugheerah ibn Shu‘bah (may Allah be pleased with him) that he proposed to a woman, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Go and look at her, for that is more likely to create affection between you” meaning that it is more likely to create lasting affection between you. This hadith was classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih at-Tirmidhi.\nAbu Dawud (2082) narrated that Jabir ibn ‘Abdillah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When one of you proposes to a woman, if he is able to see of her that which would encourage him to go ahead and marry her, then let him do so.” Classed as hasan by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud.\nThe conditions of it being permissible to look at the woman are six:\n\nIt should be without being alone with her.\nIt should be without desire.\nHe should think it most likely that they will accept his proposal.\nHe should look at what usually appears, such as the face, hands, head and feet. As for anything more than that, it is not permissible for him to look at it.\nHe should be serious in his intention to propose.\nThis is addressed to the woman: she should not appear wearing make-up or perfume.\n\nThis has been discussed previously in a number of questions here, such as questions no. 2572 and 102369 .\nThe wisdom behind the suitor looking at the woman to whom he wants to propose is that he may find out more about her, and propose to her when he is pleased with her, lest he see something in her after marriage that he dislikes, so he regrets marrying her.\nAsh-Sharbini said in al-Iqna‘ (2/405): He may look repeatedly if he needs to, so that he will have a good idea about her appearance, and so that he will not have any regrets after marrying her. End quote.\nAs for asking a lot of questions about her hobbies and ambitions, and about shaykhs and scholars, and the like, what we think is that this comes under the heading of asking too much, for which there is no basis in Islamic teachings, and it was not the practice of the righteous or of people of prominence and dignity. Moreover, they may get carried away in their conversation, and the like, in addition to the fact that usually that has no great value in ordinary married life, and it does not reflect the situation precisely. Rather the suitor should try to ask about all that from acquaintances, relatives and intermediaries, before he proposes marriage, and getting carried away in talking is not praiseworthy in this situation.\nBu if he is concerned about a specific matter, he may ask about it so as to put his mind at rest, without asking too much.\nIt is not permissible for him to sit close to her, rather he should sit far away from her, but in such a manner as to be able to fulfil the purpose of seeing her. That is because she is still a stranger to him, and Islam has only granted him a concession allowing him to look at her so that he will not have any regrets after marriage.\nRather he may sit with her until he is certain whether he would be pleased with her as a wife or not.\nIt is not permissible to laugh a great deal, or to speak softly or to speak at length about any unnecessary matters, and other such matters that are not permissible between a man and a woman who is a stranger to him.\nYou can learn more from the book Tuhfat al-‘Arus.\nFor more information on proposing marriage in the Islamically prescribed manner, please see the answer to question no. 88130 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/224450/several-questions-about-proposing-marriage-to-a-woman
249413,"I want to ask about making a profit from advertising websites and earning money from that, so that we will not get involved in anything haram or issues of riba.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt is permissible to invest in advertising websites if they meet the following conditions:\n\nJoining the website should be free; if it is in return for payment then it is haram, because it is gambling and riba, as it is exchanging money for money with delay of payment and a difference in quantity.\nThe ads should be for permissible things.\nThe participant should not use trickery with regard to clicking on ads by using software or paying websites to give the impression that there are a lot of visitors.\nWhat you will gain should be known, so every click should be worth such and such.\n\nFrom your question, it is clear that joining this website is not free; rather you have to pay a dollar. Based on that, it is haram to join it.\nThe fact that you benefit from this dollar by getting your website advertised does not make it permissible, because in reality the transaction with this website is as follows: you pay money in return for getting your website advertised, and you will be able to click on ads and make money out of that, as well as inviting others to join and make money from their contributions. This contract is haram, because it involves gambling and riba.\nAs for gambling, that is because you are paying in the hope of acquiring more every time you click on ads, which may happen or may not happen. This is definite loss for possible gain, which is the essence of gambling.\nThe reason why it is riba is because it is exchanging money for money, with an additional amount and a delay in the exchange.\nIf your aim is to advertise your website, then you should pay money and nothing else; you should not try to make money by clicking on ads. In other words, do not combine advertising with making money at the same time, because the trickery that you are trying to use to get around the prohibition is quite obvious.\nSee the answer to question no. 198784 .\nSecondly:\nWith regard to selling your account to someone else, if what is meant is selling your website, there is nothing wrong with that.\nBut if what is meant is that the one who buys it will be joining the advertising website and will be given his own account, with points and profits, then it is not permissible to sell it, because of what we have noted above about it being a haram contract.\nSimilarly, it is not permissible to invite others to join it, because that comes under the heading of helping in sin and transgression.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/249413/making-a-profit-from-ads-on-websites-by-buying-a-group-of-ads-for-one-dollar
