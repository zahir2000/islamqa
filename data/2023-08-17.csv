20227,"I like one girl, and we are gonna get WED in future. My parents are fully agreed with my decision, so her parents. Everything is going alright. The problem I am encountered with is, ""She is Christian."" While discussing with each others, I have asked her to Embrace ISLAM, And I have been given many information regarding islam so she can understand each and everything, It seems she doesn't want to EMBRACE islam. As she said "" I am very very strong christian, I just cannot accept any faith than christianity, I cannot become Muslim. She doesn't eat pork, nor, does she drinks, She is a Chaste lady with her true feelings and a Clean heart. This is true that she has nothing against my faith. She is agree to accept me with my faith and she wants me accept her with her faith, and the children would be MUSLIMS. This is what we have decided so far. Some of my friends advised me to FORCE her to EMBRACE ISLAM, Like threaten ""I won't marry you if you don't Embrace islam"" This is what my friend advised me, But as far as I realize, This wouldn't be fair at all. please Tell Me Should I force her to become Muslim? I guess, to embrace islam she must have the feelings that ALLAH is One and she should have the real feelings instead of fake feelings. I don't want to force her cause I'm scared that IF she becomes Muslim JUST to show me, JUST to get married with me, It's gonna be SIN on me. I want she to become Muslim from her true feelings and real feelings with that ALLAH is One and He is the God. I am trying my best to provide her knowledge of Islam and to show her the right path. Please tell me Should I force her?
IF she refuses to embrace Islam, Can I marry her? Can she and I get married and live as husband and wife?","['Praise be to Allah.Can Muslims Marry Christians?\nAllah has permitted a Muslim man to marry Jewish and Christian woman , on condition that they are chaste and avoid zina (unlawful sexual relations), and that the husband\xa0of that Christian woman (who is a Muslim) will then have wilayah over her.\xa0\nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Made lawful to you this day are At-Tayyibat [all kinds of Halal (lawful) foods, which Allah has made lawful (meat of slaughtered eatable animals, milk products, fats, vegetables and fruits)]. The food (slaughtered cattle, eatable animals) of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) is lawful to you and yours is lawful to them. (Lawful to you in marriage) are chaste women from the believers and chaste women from those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) before your time when you have given their due Mahr (bridal-money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage), desiring chastity (i.e. taking them in legal wedlock) not committing illegal sexual intercourse, nor taking them as girlfriends. And whosoever disbelieves in Faith, [i.e. in the Oneness of Allah and in all the other Articles of Faith i.e. His (Allah’s) Angels, His Holy Books, His Messengers, the Day of Resurrection and Al-Qadar (Divine Preordainment)], then fruitless is his work; and in the Hereafter he will be among the losers.” [Al-Maidah 5:5]\nWhat is meant by chaste is refraining from zina (unlawful sexual relationships).\xa0\nIbn Kathir said:\xa0\n“This is the view of the majority, which is the most correct opinion, so as to avoid the combination of her being a non-Muslim with her being unchaste, which would mean that she is totally corrupt and thus her husband will get, as the Arabic proverb says, “Bad goods and cheated on the weight.” The apparent meaning of the ayah is that what is meant is those who are chaste and refrain from zina.” (Tafsir Ibn Kathieer, 3/55)\xa0\nThe condition of the woman’s wali being a Muslim is indicated by the verse (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And never will Allah grant to the disbelievers a way (to triumph) over the believers.” [Al-Nisa 4:141]\nHowever, we do not advise you to marry a non-Muslim woman, nor do we advise you to marry just any Muslim woman. For married life is not based only on beauty and attraction, rather the wise Muslim must look with insight at what is beyond that, because he needs to be sure that his house will be looked after in his absence, and he needs to bring up his children, and he will not be able to find that or other things which every wise husband seeks, except with a religious Muslim woman. This is the advice of our Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).\xa0\nAbu Hurayrah narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “A woman may be married for four reasons: her wealth, her lineage, her beauty and her religious commitment. Choose the one who is religious, may your hands be rubbed with dust [i.e., may you prosper].”\xa0((Narrated by al-Bukhari, 4802; Muslim, 1466)\xa0\nAl-Nawawi said:\xa0\n“The correct meaning of this hadith is that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was describing what people usually do, for they seek these four characteristics, the last of which in their view is religious commitment, but you, the one who is seeking guidance, should look for a wife who is religious. But this is not an absolute command.\xa0\nThis hadith encourages keeping company with people who are religiously committed in all things, because the one who keeps company with them will benefit from their good attitude and morals, their blessing and their good ways, and he will be safe from mischief at their hands.” (Sharh Muslim, 10/52)\xa0\nA realistic look at marriage to women of the People of the Book\nBut marriage to women of the People of the Book leads to a great deal of mischief and trouble, such as:\xa0\n\nHe may have to be courteous to this wife of his at the expense of his religion, especially if she is “very committed” to her own religion. This may mean that she will hang up crosses and go to the church, and the children will not be safe in this environment.\nShe is not going to wash properly after finishing her period, or tell him not to have intercourse with her when she is menstruating; she is going to make him do something that is wrong according to shari’ah and cause him physical harm.\nHe is going to be put in an embarrassing situation because of her careless attitude concerning dress and her mixing with men and speaking to them.\nThe states and governments of these women of the Book will be on their side and will give them custody of the children if differences arise and divorce takes place. This will cause these children to be lost and to fall into kufr. Such cases are too well known to need mentioning here and too many to count.\n\nIt may be said:\xa0\nMarriage to a Christian is not ideal as the likelihood of the children becoming Christian is high..\nYou must look for one who is religiously committed, if you want a sound marriage.\nForget about the people of kufr and beware of marrying them, for that will lead to a lot of evil.\nThe children of such a marriage will not be guided; they will swell the ranks of evildoers.\xa0\nCan you force your Christian wife to become Muslim?\nIt is not permissible for you to force your Christian wife – if you do marry her – to become Muslim. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“There is no compulsion in religion. Verily, the Right Path has become distinct from the wrong path. Whoever disbelieves in Taghut [falsehood, false gods] and believes in Allah, then he has grasped the most trustworthy handhold that will never break. And Allah is All-Hearer, All-Knower.” [Al-Baqarah 2:256]\nIbn Kathir said:\xa0\n“Allah says: “There is no compulsion in religion ” meaning: do not force anyone to enter Islam, for it is obvious and clear, and its proof and evidence are apparent. There is no need to force anyone to enter it, rather whomever Allah guides to Islam and opens his heart to it and illuminates his insight will enter it with conviction; but whoever Allah makes blind in his heart and seals his hearing and insight will not benefit from being compelled to enter the religion by force. They said that the reason for the revelation of this verse was concerning some people among the Ansar, even though this ruling is general.” (Tasfieer Ibn Kathir, 1/311)\xa0\nWe advise you – once again – to leave this woman and to pray to Allah to guide your heart to that which is in the best interests of your religion. So long as you give her up for the sake of Allah, then you should be certain that Allah will replace her for you with someone better, for whoever gives up something for the sake of Allah, Allah will compensate him with something better.\xa0\nFor more, please see these answers: 21380 , 8396 , and 21047 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20227/can-a-muslim-marry-a-christian
317409,"One day we found a gift, a brand-new mobile phone, in the window of the children’s room, and we do not know who put it there. With it there was a small piece of paper on which was written “This is a gift for you, Son-and-so son of So-and-so” – addressed to my fourteen-year-old son. Is it permissible to take it and use it? Or what should we do in this case?","['Praise be to Allah.One of the established principles in Islamic teachings is that the Muslim should not take something that belongs someone else unless it is given with the owner’s willing consent. So if it becomes clear that there was consent, on the basis of acceptable proof, then it is permissible to take that thing in that case.\nProof that is regarded as acceptable, according to the purists, includes reasonable circumstantial evidence.\nShaykh az-Zarqa (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhat is meant by circumstantial evidence is any clear sign that clarifies a subtle issue and confirms it.""(Al-Madkhal al-Fiqhi al-‘Am\xa0 2/936).\nCircumstantial evidence that is that which makes an issue go from being possible to being most likely to be the case, and what it indicates is to be taken into account as being reliable, unless it is contradicted by other evidence that is stronger than it.\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe Lawgiver did not disregard signs, indications and circumstantial evidence; rather whoever examines the religious texts will find proof that these things carry weight and rulings may be based on them.""(At-Turuq al-Hukmiyyah\xa0 1/27).\nThe scholars have a great deal of evidence to support that, including the report narrated by Abu Dawud (3632) from Jabir ibn ‘Abdillah, who said: I wanted to go out to Khaybar, so I came to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and greeted him with salaam, and I said to him: I want to go out to Khaybar. He said: “When you come to my deputy, take five wasqs from him. If he asks you for a sign, place your hand on his collar bone.”\nThe isnad of this hadith was classed as hasan by al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar, who said: al-Bukhari narrated part of it in a mu‘allaq report at the end of Kitab al-Khumus.""(At-Talkhis al-Habir\xa0 3/122).\nBased on that:\nThe fact that you found a mobile phone in the window of the house, accompanied by a message stating that its owner was giving it as a gift to So-and-so, is circumstantial evidence which indicates that it is a gift and is permissible for you, and that as a result it becomes the property of your son.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/317409/he-received-a-gift-from-an-unknown-person
