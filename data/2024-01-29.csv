153894,What is the ruling on keeping a dog outside the house as a pet? What is meant by the loss of two qirats of one’s good deeds – does it mean that it is forbidden (haram) or disliked (makruh)?,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt is not permissible to keep a dog as a pet only, and it makes no difference whether the dog is kept inside the house or in a separate place outside the house.\nThis is indicated by the report which was narrated by al-Bukhari (5060) and Muslim (2941) from Ibn ‘Umar, according to which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever keeps a dog, except a dog for hunting or herding livestock, two qirats will be deducted from his reward every day.” According to another version: “Whoever keeps a dog, two qirats will be deducted from his good deeds every day…” al-Bukhari (2154) and Muslim (2949).\nAn-Nawawi said:\nOur companions and others are agreed that it is haram to keep a dog unnecessarily, such as if someone keeps it because he likes the way it looks, or to show off. This is prohibited, and there is no difference of opinion concerning that.""(Sharh Sahih Muslim\xa0 1/448).\nThat is because dogs are lowly and dirty animals, and because of the harm and negative consequences involved in keeping them; for example, they keep the angels away from the place where the dog is; they scare and frighten others; they are impure; and are dirty.\nIf there is a need for that, because of some benefits and interests that are served, such as guarding sheep from the danger of wolves and thieves, or keeping them for farming purposes, or using them for hunting, then these benefits justify keeping a dog, and there is no blame on the one who does that.""(Taysir al-‘Allam Sharh ‘Umdat al-Hukkam\xa0 2/209).\nPlease see also the answers to questions no. 33668 and 69777 .\nSecondly:\nMost of those who commented on this hadith are of the view that the Prophet’s words “two qirats will be deducted from his reward every day” indicate that it is haram.\nNone of the scholars disagreed with that, as far as we know, except Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr among the leading scholars of hadith, and the Maliki scholars. He was of the view that the hadith indicates that keeping dogs is disliked (makruh), but not haram.\nIbn ‘Abd al-Barr said:\nThis hadith indicates that keeping dogs is not haram, even if they are kept for purposes other than farming, herding and hunting, because the words “two qirats will be deducted from his reward every day” indicate that it is permissible, not prohibited, because it cannot be said of prohibited things that whoever does this thing, such and such will be detracted from his good deeds or from his reward. Rather, if it was prohibited, the Lawgiver would have prohibited it in clear terms, so that the Muslim would not do any such thing. Rather this wording indicates that it is disliked (makruh), not prohibited (haram).""(Al-Istidhkar al-Jami‘ li Madhahib Fuqaha’ al-Ansar\xa0 9/450).\nThis a view of Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr is a weak view, which more than one of the scholars have commented on.\nAl-Hafiz al-‘Iraqi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: His view is strange, because our conclusion that it is haram is based on that detraction from the reward, for that indicates that he has done something that is prohibited, which nullifies the reward of some of his good deeds, just as the non-acceptance of prayers from one who drinks alcohol, a runaway slave and one who goes to a fortune teller or soothsayer (as mentioned in other hadiths) indicates that these actions are prohibited. The fact that they are prohibited is the reason why the reward for prayer is nullified in these cases.\nAnd he said: The reason why the wording of the hadith indicates that it is prohibited is very clear, because detraction from reward can only come about because of the sin that one has committed.""(Tarh al-Tathrib\xa0 6/173).\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar said: What is claimed, that it is not haram based on the argument that he stated, is not sound. Rather it is possible that the punishment could come in the form of no longer being enabled to do a qirat’s worth of righteous deeds that he used to do, when he did not keep a dog.\nAnd it is possible that keeping a dog is haram, and what is meant by detracting from the reward is that the sin that results from keeping the dog is equivalent to one or two qirats of reward, so what is detracted from the reward of the dog owner’s righteous deeds is equivalent to the sin incurred by keeping the dog, which is one or two qirats.""(Fath al-Bari\xa0 5/7).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/153894/ruling-on-keeping-a-dog-outside-the-house-as-a-pet
178639,We know the Hadith of the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) about the rights of one Muslim over another.,"['Praise be to Allah.Will you be sinning if you fail to fulfil one of the rights of another Muslim?\nThe rights that one Muslim has over another are many; some of which are individual obligations that are required of each person, and if he fails to do them he is sinning. Others are communal obligations; if some people do them, the burden of sin is waived for the rest. And some are encouraged but not obligatory, so the Muslim is not sinning if he does not do them.\xa0\nHow many rights does a Muslim have over another Muslim?\nAl-Bukhari (1240) and Muslim (2162) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “The rights of one Muslim over another are five: returning the greeting of Salam, visiting the sick, attending funerals, accepting invitations, and saying Yarhamuk Allah (may Allah have mercy on you) to one who sneezes.”\xa0\nAnd Muslim (2162) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The rights of one Muslim over another are six.” It was said: What are they, O Messenger of Allah? He said: “If you meet him, greet him with Salam; if he invites you, accept the invitation; if he asks for advice, give him sincere advice; if he sneezes and praises Allah, say Yarhamuk Allah (may Allah have mercy on you); if he falls sick, visit him; and if he dies, attend his funeral.”\xa0\nAsh-Shawkani (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “What is meant by the words “The rights of the Muslim” is that they should not be omitted and doing them is either obligatory, or encouraged to such an extent that it is very similar to being obligatory and should not be omitted. The word “right” (Haqq) may be used in the sense of obligatory, as was mentioned by Ibn Al-`Arabi.” (Nayl Al-Awtar, 4/21)\xa0\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Returning the greeting of Salam is obligatory if the greeting is given to one person. If it is given to a group, then it is obligatory upon the group (Fard Kifayah or communal obligation; if one of the group returns the greeting, the obligation has been met). With regard to initiating the greeting, the basic principle is that it is encouraged.\xa0\nIt says in Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah (11/314):\xa0\n“Initiating the greeting is Sunnah Mu’akkadah (a confirmed Sunnah) because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Spread the greeting of Salam amongst yourselves.” It is obligatory to return the greeting if it is given to one person. If the greeting is given to a group, then in their case responding is a Fard Kifayah (communal obligation); if one of them responds the sin is waived from the others, but if they all respond, they have all done what is required, Whether they respond all together or one after another. If they all refrain from responding, then they are all sinning because of the report which says: “The rights of one Muslim over another are five: returning (the greeting) of Salam…”\xa0\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Visiting the sick it is a communal obligation .\xa0\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0“Visiting the sick is a Fard Kifayah (communal obligation).” (Majmu` Fatawa wa Rasa’il Ibn `Uthaymin, 13/1085)\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Attending funerals is also a Fard Kifayah (communal obligation).\xa0\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 With regard to accepting invitations , if the invitation is to a wedding feast, then the majority of scholars are of the view that it is obligatory to accept unless there is a legitimate Shar‘i reason not to do so. If it is for something other than a wedding feast, the majority are of the view that it is encouraged. But there are conditions for accepting invitations in general terms.\xa0\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 With regard to saying Yarhamuk Allah (May Allah have mercy on you) to one who sneezes, there is a difference of opinion concerning the ruling.\xa0\nIt says in Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah, 4/22:\xa0\n“This saying Yarhamuk Allah (May Allah have mercy on you) is encouraged according to the Shafa`is.\xa0\nAccording to the Hanbalis and the Hanafis, it is obligatory.\xa0\nThe Malikis said – and it is also an opinion among the Hanbalis – that it is a communal obligation. It was narrated from Al-Bayan that the stronger view is that it is an individual obligation (Fard ‘Ayn), because of the Hadith: “It is the duty of every Muslim who hears him (the one who sneezes) to say: Yarhamuk Allah (may Allah have mercy on you).\nThe more correct opinion is that it is obligatory on the one who hears the sneezer praise Allah (by saying “Al-hamdu Lillah”), because of the report narrated by Al-Bukhari (6223) from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) who said: “Allah likes the act of sneezing and dislikes the act of yawning, so if any one of you sneezes and praises Allah (says ‘Al-hamdu Lillah’), it is a duty on every Muslim who hears him to say to him, ‘Yarhamuk Allah (may Allah have mercy on you).’”\xa0\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“We have quoted above the Hadith of Abu Hurayrah, in which it says: “if any one of you sneezes and praises Allah (says ‘Al-hamdu Lillah’), it is a duty (Haqq) on every Muslim who hears him to say to him, ‘Yarhamuk Allah (may Allah have mercy on you).”. At-Tirmidhi included the Hadith of Anas under the heading: Chapter on what was narrated about it being obligatory to say Yarhamuk Allah (may Allah have mercy on you) when one who sneezes says Al-hamdu Lillah (Praise be to Allah). This indicates that it is obligatory in his view, and this is the correct view, because of the Hadiths that clearly indicate that it is obligatory and there was nothing to contradict that, and Allah knows best.\xa0\nOne of them is the Hadith of Abu Hurayrah mentioned above, and another is his other Hadith, “There are five (rights) that the Muslim has over his brother,” which is also mentioned above. Another is the Hadith of Salim ibn ‘Ubayd, in which it says: “Let those who are with him say to him: Yarhamuk Allah (may Allah have mercy on you).” And another is the report narrated by At-Tirmidhi from ‘Ali who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The Muslim has six (rights) over his fellow-Muslim: he should greet him with Salam when he meets him; he should respond when he invites him; he should say Yarhamuk Allah (may Allah have mercy on you) if he sneezes; he should visit him if he falls sick; he should attend his funeral if he dies; and he should love for him what he loves for himself.” He (At-Tirmidhi) said: This is a sound Hadith. It was also narrated via another Isnad (chain of narration) from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Some of the scholars spoke negatively about Al-Harith Al-A‘war (one of the narrators). In the same chapter it is also narrated from Abu Hurayrah, Abu Ayyub, Al-Bara’ and Abu Mas‘ud. And another of these Hadiths is that which was narrated by At-Tirmidhi from Abu Ayyub, according to which the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If one of you sneezes, let him say Al-hamdu Lillah (praise be to Allah); and let him say ‘ala kulli hal (in all circumstances). And let the one who responds to him say: Yarhamuk Allah (may Allah have mercy on you). And let him say: Yahdikum Allahu wa yuslih balakum (May Allah guide you and set your affairs straight).\xa0\nThere are four kinds of proof in the Hadith quoted above (“if any one of you sneezes and praises Allah (says ‘Al-hamdu Lillah’), it is a duty (Haqq) on every Muslim who hears him to say to him, ‘Yarhamuk Allah (may Allah have mercy on you)”):\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 there is a clear statement that it is obligatory to say Yarhamuk Allah (may Allah have mercy on you), which cannot be interpreted in any other way;\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 it is made obligatory by use of the word Haqq (translated above as duty);\n3.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 it is made obligatory by use of the word ‘Ala (on). This word clearly means that it is obligatory\n4.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 it is enjoined. There can be no doubt that there are many duties that are proven to be obligatory on the basis of less evidence than this. And Allah knows best.” (Hashiyat Ibn Al-Qayyim ‘ala Sunan Abu Dawud, 13/259)\xa0\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) also said:\xa0\n“The apparent meaning of the Hadith mentioned above is that saying Yarhamuk Allah is an individual obligation upon everyone who hears the one who sneezed say Al-hamdu Lillah; it is not acceptable for just one of them to say it. This is one of the two scholarly opinions, which was favoured by the Malikis Ibn Abu Zayd and Abu Bakr ibn Al-‘Arabi, and it cannot be otherwise.” (Zad Al-Ma`ad, 2/437)\xa0\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 With regard to giving him advice if he asks for it, it is most likely that offering advice is a communal obligation.\xa0\nIbn Muflih (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“The apparent meaning of the words of Ahmad and our companions is that it is obligatory to offer advice to the Muslim , even if he does not ask for it, as is the apparent meaning of the reports.” (Al-Adab Ash-Shar‘iyyah by Ibn Muflih, 1/307)\xa0\nAl-Mullah `Ali Al-Qari (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“If he asks you for advice” means if he asks you for advice, then give it to him; it is obligatory. It is also obligatory to give advice even if he did not ask for it.” (Mirqat Al-Mafatih, 5/213)\xa0\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“It is clear that what is meant by “duty” (Haqq) here is that it is obligatory. This is different from the words of Ibn Battal who said that what is meant is the duty of respect and companionship. It seems that what is meant here is that it is a communal obligation.” (Fath Al-Bari, 3/113)\xa0\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 21878 and 65649\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/178639/is-failing-to-fulfil-one-right-of-a-muslim-a-sin
148923,"I have Muslim teachers, but they do not wear hijab, and one of them is Shi‘i. I want to advise them and give them some Islamic books… Would that be considered to be bribery? Allah knows that my intention has nothing to do with bribery at all. As that is the case, how can I call them to wear hijab and follow the path of our Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)? On one occasion I spoke with my Shi‘i teacher and she liked what I said. She said: “Ma sha Allah, you have knowledge!” But she also told me: “I have lived all my life as a Shi‘i; my parents brought me up in this way. Thank you for talking to me anyway.” And the conversation with her ended. But I want to do more; I want to explain things to her and give her books so that she could follow the path of the Sunnah. What do you advise me to do?","['Praise be to Allah.We ask Allah to make you steadfast in guidance and to help you to speak the truth and tell others about it, and to fulfil the duty of calling people to Allah on the basis of knowledge, seeking His pleasure.\nYou should understand that your advising these teachers, telling them what is right and warning them about what is wrong is a noble action for which you deserve to be praised. So we ask Allah to help you to do it and to increase you in guidance and faith, and to benefit you and benefit others through you.\nWith regard to giving them Islamic books, it is better not to do that, so as to err on the side of caution. It is also better to keep away from an action that could resemble a bribe or have an impact on them at a time when they have some authority over you, as they are in charge of your education, and it could make them favour you when giving grades and so on, because people have a natural inclination towards those who do them favours.\nYou can avoid that by making the books that you give to them a loan, so that one of them can read it, then give it back to you. This is more prudent and will absolve you of any wrongdoing. Moreover, it may be more beneficial, because you can guarantee that the teacher will read it, and it is possible that this exchange will lead to a discussion between you and the teacher, so that you can talk with her about the content of the book.\nIf you want to give her a book, then keep that book with you for now, until you finish your time in school.

132608,"With all due respect to the one who answered question no. 21365 about the two verses (no. 106, 107) of Surah Hud, you stated that the people of Hell will abide therein forever and ever and will never come out of it. However, I read in Sahih Al-Bukhari (Book 2, 12, 72) that Allah will show mercy to some of the people of Hell and will admit them to Paradise because of what there is in their hearts of faith in Him. Which of the two is more correct? If both are correct, how can we reconcile between them? Based on that, do the verses in Surah Hud indicate that some of those who do good deeds will remain for a similar period in Paradise but in the end they will enter Hell? If that is not the case, then how will these disbelievers who spend their lives in the service of humanity then die in non-Muslim countries – like Mother Teresa – be rewarded?","['Praise be to Allah.We appreciate the questioner’s interest in the answers that we publish on our website and his following up on them. We also appreciate his question about the apparent contradiction, which is indicative of his love of learning and his efforts to benefit from what he reads, in sha Allah.\xa0\nTypes of people in Hell\nThere is no contradiction between what is mentioned in the answer to the question referred to, and the Hadiths referred to in the question. To explain further, the people of Hell are of two types:\xa0\n\nThe first type are monotheists (people who affirmed the Oneness of Allah) who mixed good deeds with bad deeds. Allah will admit them to Hell for their sins, and He has willed that they should be punished there.\xa0\n\nThis category will be punished in Hell for a while, and Allah, may He be Exalted, is the One Who will determine the length thereof. Then He will bring them out of the Fire and will decree that they will abide for eternity in Paradise after that.\xa0\nThese are the ones referred to in the Hadiths mentioned in the question, in which it is stated that some of those who are in the Fire will be brought out because of what they believe in of Tawhid (the Oneness of Allah). They are the people of Hell among the Muslims.\xa0\n\nThe second type are the disbelievers and hypocrites who do not have any belief in Tawhid and who die in a state of disbelief, Shirk (polytheism), atheism or hypocrisy.\xa0\n\nThis category will be punished in Hell for eternity. Their Lord warned them that they would abide in Hell for eternity if they did not do what Allah, may He be Exalted, commanded them to do of affirming His Oneness (Tawhid) and devoting all their acts of worship\xa0 to Him alone. They chose for themselves Kufr (disbelief) and they chose to abide for eternity in the Fire.\xa0\nThese are the ones who are referred to in the verses of Surah Hud referred to at the beginning of your question.\xa0\nWho will go to Hell?\nFrom what we have mentioned above, you will realise that being admitted to Hell is not just for one group; rather it is for two groups, one of which will be brought out of it. They are the monotheists (believers in Tawhid, the Oneness of Allah) who committed sins that meant that they deserved to enter Hell. The other group will not be brought out of it; those are the ones who disbelieved and died in a state of disbelief.\xa0\nCan You Get Kicked out of Jannah?\nWith regard to Paradise, none will enter it except one group, namely the monotheists (believers in Tawhid). When a person enters it, he will never exit from it; rather he will enjoy what it contains, and he will never feel sorrow or despair, he will never die or fall sick, he will never grow old or be deprived of that delight after he has tasted it.\xa0\nOnce you understand that there are two categories of people, those who believe and those who disbelieve, those who are blessed (destined for Paradise) and those who are doomed (destined for Hell), then you will be able to understand what is mentioned in the Book of Allah, may He be Exalted, of the decree that there will be no exit from Hell, and that those who are referred to in this case are the disbelievers who will abide in Hell forever, as Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Thus Allah will show them their deeds as regrets for them. And they will never get out of the Fire.” [Al-Baqarah 2:167]\n“They will long to get out of the Fire, but never will they get out therefrom, and theirs will be a lasting torment.” [Al-Ma’idah 5:37]\xa0\nWith regard to those who are blessed (destined for Paradise) and the people of faith, Allah, may He be Exalted, has decreed that they will not exit from Paradise , as He, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“No sense of fatigue shall touch them, nor shall they (ever) be asked to leave it.” [Al-Hijr 15:48].\xa0\nFor more information, please see the answers to questions no.\xa031174 ,\xa026792 \xa0and\xa045804\nWill disbelievers enter Jannah?\nOnce this is understood clearly, it should be noted that if the disbeliever does something that is deserving of reward, he will be rewarded for it in this world , not in the Hereafter. His disbelief prevents his deed being accepted in such a way that he may benefit from it in the Hereafter, because one of the conditions of good deeds being accepted is that one should be Muslim.\xa0\nAt-Tabari (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\nIf a person does a righteous deed without fearing Allah – i.e., he is a Mushrik or polytheist – he will be given a reward for that in this world, such as if he upholds ties of kinship, gives to one who is in need out of compassion, and other such righteous deeds. Allah will give him the reward of his good deed in this world, such as increasing his livelihood and provision, giving him joy in what He blesses him with, warding off from him the harms of this world, and so on. But he will not have any share (of reward) in the Hereafter.\xa0\nTafsir At-Tabari, 15/265\xa0\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Al-Qadi ‘Iyad said: There is scholarly consensus that the deeds of the disbelievers will not benefit them [in the Hereafter]; they will not be rewarded for them with joy and no punishment will be reduced for them, even though some of them will be more severely punished than others.” (Al-Fath, 9/48)\xa0\nIt should be understood that Allah, may He be Exalted, will not cause the reward for their deeds that benefit people to be lost; but their reward will come in this world and not in the Hereafter. As for the believer, the reward for his good deeds will be in this world and in the Hereafter.\xa0\nAnas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If the disbeliever does a good deed, he is fed because of it in this world. As for the believer, Allah stores up his good deeds for him in the Hereafter and grants him provision in accordance with his obedience in this world.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2808)\xa0\nAccording to another report, “Allah does not treat the believer unjustly with regard to his good deeds. He blesses him because of them in this world and He will reward him for them in the Hereafter. As for the disbeliever, he is fed because of the good deeds that he does for the sake of Allah in this world, then when he passes on into the Hereafter, he will have no good deeds left for which to be rewarded.”\nYou should understand that this reward in this world is not definite; rather it is subject to the Will of Allah. Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “Whoever wishes for the quick-passing (transitory enjoyment of this world), We readily grant him what We will for whom We like.” [Al-Isra’ 18:18]\xa0\nAsh-Shanqiti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“It should be understood that this matter, for which we have quoted evidence from the Quran and Sunnah, that the disbeliever may benefit from his righteous deeds in this world, such as honouring his parents, upholding ties of kinship, honouring guests and neighbours, relieving people of distress and so on – all of that is subject to the Will of Allah, may He be Exalted, as He has stated in the verse (interpretation of the meaning): “Whoever wishes for the quick-passing (transitory enjoyment of this world), We readily grant him what We will for whom We like.” [Al-Isra’ 18:18]\xa0\nThis verse is specific and specifies what is mentioned in general terms in other verses and Hadiths.” (Adwa’ Al-Bayan, 3/450)\xa0\nWhat we have mentioned about Allah, may He be Exalted, rewarding whomever He wills among the disbelievers does not apply to Mother Teresa, whose original name was Anjezë Gonxhe Bojaxhiu. She originally came from Macedonia and died in 1997 CE. She was a missionary nun whose work focused on helping the poor, destitute and sick, and she used her work to try to convert them to Christianity. The deeds of a person like this cannot be called “good” and whatever provision he or she gets in this world is not the reward of good deeds; rather it is provision that is granted by Allah, for which those who disbelieve in Him will be punished, as Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And (remember) when Ibrahim (Abraham) said, ‘My Lord, make this city (Makkah) a place of security and provide its people with fruits, such of them as believe in Allah and the Last Day.’ He (Allah) answered: ‘As for him who disbelieves, I shall leave him in contentment for a while, then I shall compel him to the torment of the Fire, and worst indeed is that destination!’.” [Al-Baqarah 2:126].\xa0\nTypes of the deeds of the disbelievers\nTo sum up, the deeds of the disbelievers in this world are of two types:\xa0\n\nWorldly deeds such as acts of kindness, in which it is not stipulated that one should have the intention of drawing close to Allah, such as upholding ties of kinship, honouring guests, and so on. This is what is referred to in the Hadith, for which the disbeliever will be rewarded in this world if Allah wants to reward him.\xa0\n\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“It is clearly stated in this Hadith that (the disbeliever) is fed in this world because of what he does of good deeds, i.e., what he does seeking thereby to draw closer to Allah of actions in which their validity does not depend on the intention, such as upholding ties of kinship, giving charity, manumitting slaves, hosting guests, and other good deeds.”\xa0(Sharh Muslim, 17/150)\xa0\n\nWorldly deeds, in which the doer’s intention is to spread his religion and mislead Muslims away from their religion. These are not included in the Hadith; rather the sternest warning is given to the one who does them, because he is turning people away from the religion of Allah and exploiting people’s needs, poverty and sickness for this evil purpose. That includes what Mother Teresa and other missionaries and promoters of falsehood are doing.\xa0\n\nWith regard to religious actions in which it is stipulated that one should have the intention of drawing close to Allah, such as Hajj, `Umrah and du`a (supplication), the disbeliever will not be rewarded for these either in this world or in the Hereafter , because it is invalid, as some of the conditions of its being accepted are not present, i.e., being Muslim, being sincere towards Allah alone, and following (the Sunnah). Moreover, disbelief renders good deeds invalid, so the one who does them will not benefit from them at all on the Day of Resurrection.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/132608/can-anyone-get-expelled-from-jannah
