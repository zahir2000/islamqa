504160,"I deal in crypto spot trading only, without financial leverage or margins, and as far as I know it is permissible. Sometimes we follow Telegram channels which publish leaked recommendations from other channels belonging to analysts who have private, paid-for channels, for which they charge a subscription fee. I want to ask about the ruling on engaging in a transaction based on leaked information that is made available to the public for free, even though I know that this advice is leaked from another, paid-for channel. If the answer is that it is not permissible, what should I do if I got this advice through leaks?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt is permissible to deal in crypto currency, if the exchange takes place immediately and the transaction is free of any infractions of Islamic teachings, such as using financial leverages and dealing in differences, futures and so on.\nPlease see the answers to questions no. 106094 , 125758 and 310956 .\nSecondly:\nIt is not permissible to transgress against the rights of others, such as leaking recommendations from a channel of which the owners do not allow publishing them and making them available to the public, even if the one who leaks them is a subscriber to the channel, but the owners do not allow people to publicise them. That is because of the established principle which says that “Muslims are bound by their conditions.” Moreover, intellectual property rights are rights which must be protected and it is forbidden to transgress against them.\nIt says in a statement of the Islamic Fiqh Council regarding non-tangible rights:\nIntellectual property rights and patents are protected according to Islamic teachings. Their owners have the right to dispose of them, and it is not permissible to transgress against them.""(Majallat al-Majma‘ (vol. 5, issue 3, p. 2267).\nThirdly:\nIf a book or analysis is published and the authors do not want it to be made available to the public for free, but it is made available to people, is it haram to read it and make use of it?\nWhat appears to be the case is that it is not haram, unless that helps the transgressor to continue in his transgression, such as if he publishes it in a video clip, and clicking on it will encourage him to carry on doing that.\nBut if it will not help him in his transgression, such as if it is taken from somewhere other than his website, then there is nothing wrong with making use of the book or analysis that has been published.\nFor more information, please see the answers to questions no. 226230 , 236653 and 130235 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/504160/what-is-the-ruling-on-dealing-in-crypto-currency-and-benefitting-from-market-analysis-that-is-leaked-to-us
247636,“Daughters are good deeds and sons are blessings; good deeds will be rewarded and blessings will be asked about” – how sound is this hadith and what does it mean?,"['Praise be to Allah.These words are not known to be narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) or from any of his companions. Rather they were quoted by some of the scholars from some of the early generations.\nAbu Mansur ath-Tha‘alibi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Durar al-Hukam (p. 24):\nJa‘far ibn Muhammad said: “Daughters are good deeds and sons are blessings; good deeds will be rewarded and blessings will be asked about.”\nThe Shi‘ah often quote these words in their books and attribute them to Ja‘far ibn Muhammad (may Allah have mercy on him), but what they mention in their books cannot be quoted as evidence, because they tell lies about Allah and His Messenger, and they tell lies about the early generations of this ummah.\nIbn ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Bahjat al-Majalis (p. 162):\nMuhammad ibn Sulayman said: Sons are a blessing and daughters are good deeds, and Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will bring people to account for blessings and will reward them for good deeds.\nSomething similar was mentioned by Ibn Muflih (may Allah have mercy on him) in al-Adab ash-Shar‘iyyah (1/454), quoting from Muhammad ibn Sulayman.\nSons and daughters are both blessings that Allah, may He be exalted, bestows on people, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{He bestows female [offspring] upon whomever He wills, and bestows male [offspring] upon whomever He wills,\nor He bestows both males and females; and He leaves barren whomever He wills. Verily, He is All-Knowing, Omnipotent}\xa0[ash-Shura 42:49-50].\nIt may be that what is meant by the one who said that is that the blessing of sons is greater and more perfect.\nBut there are a number of hadiths which speak of the virtue of raising daughters, such as that in which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Anyone who is tested with daughters and treats them kindly, they will be a shield for him against the Fire.”\nAnd he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever takes care of two girls until they reach puberty, he and I will come like this on the Day of Resurrection” – and he held his two fingers together. Narrated by Muslim (2631).\nThe criterion to determine which is better is not gender; rather the criterion is righteousness, and joy is to be found in having righteous offspring.\nA daughter may be better for her parents in this world and the hereafter than a son, or it may be the other way round.\nSons and daughters are both blessings, and they both come under the heading of good deeds, if Allah blesses them.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/247636/daughters-are-good-deeds-and-sons-are-blessings-good-deeds-will-be-rewarded-and-blessings-will-be-asked-about-how-sound-is-this-hadith-and-what-does-it-mean
139953,"The two Angels, who write our lives in a book (good and bad things) , don't come to the house with a picture? When I pray and there is a picture. I must give Salam to the angels(Taslim) and the angels aren't here, because there are pictures in the house?","['Praise be to Allah.Do recording Angels enter a house with pictures?\nYes, the recording angels who write down the deeds of the son of Adam enter houses in which there are images.\xa0\nDo Angels of mercy enter a house with pictures?\xa0\nWhat is meant by the angels who do not enter a house in which there are images are the angels of mercy.\xa0\nAl-Bukhari (3226) and Muslim (2106) narrated from Abu Talhah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said; “The angels do not enter a house in which there is an image.”\xa0\nWhy\xa0 don’t the angels of mercy enter a house with pictures\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“The scholars said: The reason why they do not enter a house in which there is an image is because it is a grievous sin, and it is competing with the creation of Allah, may He be exalted, and some of them are images of things that are worshipped instead of Allah, may He be exalted.\xa0\nWith regard to these angels who do not enter a house in which there is a dog or an image, they are the angels who go round with mercy, blessings and prayers for forgiveness. With regard to the recording angels, they enter every house and never leave the sons of Adam under any circumstances, because they are enjoined to list and record their deeds .” (Sharh Muslim, 14/84)\nIt says in Tuhfat Al-Ahwadhi (8/72): \xa0\n“The words “the angels do not enter” mean: the angels of mercy, not the recording angels or the Angels of death.”\xa0\nIbn Al-Athir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“What is meant is the angels who travel about and not the recording angels and those who are present at the time of death.” (An-Nihayah, 4/789)\nAs-Suyuti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Al-Khattabi said: What is meant is the angels who bring mercy and blessings, not the recording angels.” (Sharh An-Nasa’i, 1/141)\nShaykh Muhammad ibn Ibrahim (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Are his words “The angels do not enter a house in which there is an image or a dog” general in meaning and do they include the recording angels or not?\xa0\nHe replied: “It seems that they are not included in this.” (Fatawa wa Rasa’il Muhammad ibn Ibrahim, 1/169)\xa0\nWhat are the images that prevent angels from entering a house?\nThe images which prevent the angels from entering a house are images of animate beings, apart from images that are dealt with in a disrespectful manner.\xa0\nAl-Khattabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“The angels do not enter a house in which there is a dog or an image that it is forbidden to keep. With regard to that which it is not forbidden to keep, such as a dog for hunting, farming or guarding livestock, or images that are not dealt with in a respectful manner (such as) those on carpets, pillows and the like, the angels are not prevented from entering because of them.” (Tuhfat Al-Ahwadhi, 8/72)\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin said: “If the images are treated without respect, such as images on carpets or pillows, the majority of scholars are of the view that they are permissible. Based on that, the angels are not prevented from entering that place, because if they were prevented that would be not allowed.” (Liqa’ Al-Bab Al-Maftuh, 85/6)\xa0\nCan you pray in a place where there is an image?\nWith regard to praying in a place where there is an image, it is not permissible, unless the Muslim is forced to pray in that place and is not able to remove the image.\xa0\nThe scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas said:\xa0\n“Praying in places where these images are is not permissible except in cases of necessity. The same applies to praying in clothes on which there are images of animals; it is not permissible, but if he does it, his prayer is sound but he is committing a forbidden action.” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 1/705)\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/139953/do-recording-angels-enter-a-house-with-pictures
