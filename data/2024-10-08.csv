271520,"I want to know the ruling on buying a cat and keeping it as a pet, because I cannot get a cat as a gift or by adopting one, and there are no street cats where we live. The type of cat that I want cannot be obtained except by buying it, as I live in a western country.","['Praise be to Allah.Keeping pets in Islam\nThere is nothing wrong with keeping cats in the house and taking care of them. The great Companion Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) used to take care of several cats, to the extent that he was nicknamed for that.\nIt was narrated that `Abdullah ibn Rafi` (may Allah have mercy on him) said: I said to Abu Hurayrah: Why do you have the Kunyah (nickname) of Abu Hurayrah?\nHe said: I used to tend my family’s sheep, and I had a small kitten (Hurayrah in Arabic) that I used to put in a tree at night, then during the day I would take it with me and play with it. Hence they called me Abu Hurayrah (“father of the kitten”). (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 3840; classed as sound by Al-Hafidh in\xa0Al-Isabah,\xa013/30)\nIbn Al-Mundhir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The scholars unanimously agreed that keeping cats is permissible. (End quote from\xa0Al-Awsat,\xa010/27)\nIs it prohibited to buy and sell a cat?\nThe view of most of the scholars – including the four Imams – is that it is permissible to buy and sell pet cats.\nImam An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Selling pet cats is permissible, and there is no difference of opinion among us concerning that… This is the view of the majority of scholars… The concession to sell cats was given by Ibn `Abbas, Ibn Sirin, Al-Hakam, Hammad, Malik, Ath-Thawri, Ash-Shafi`i, Ahmad, Is-haq, Abu Hanifah and all the As-hab Ar-Ra’i.” (End quote from Al-Majmu` Sharh Al-Muhadhdhab,\xa09/229)\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) also said: If the cat is of the type that is useful and he sells it, the sale is valid and its price is lawful. This is our view and the view of all the scholars, except for what Ibn Al-Mundhir narrated from Abu Hurayrah, Tawus, Mujahid and Jabir ibn Zayd, that it is not permissible to sell cats.”\xa0(End quote from Sharh Sahih Muslim,\xa010/233)\nThey quoted as evidence for it being permissible to sell cats the report narrated by Muslim (2619) from Abu Hurayrah, that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “A woman entered Hell because of a cat which she had and which she tied up and did not feed it or let it loose to eat of the vermin of the earth, until it died of starvation.”\nThey said: The\xa0Lam\xa0in the phrase\xa0Hirratin Laha\xa0(translated here as a cat which she had) is indicative of ownership, and whatever can be owned and is of benefit, it is permissible to sell it. (End quote from Kashshaf Al-Qina`,\xa03/153)\nThe Dhahiris (literalists) and some of the scholars are of the view that it is prohibited to buy and sell cats. They quoted as evidence for that the report narrated by Imam Muslim in his\xa0Sahih\xa0(1569) via Ma`qil from Abuz-Zubayr, who said: I asked Jabir about the price of a dog or cat.\nHe said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah upon him) prohibited that.\nIn\xa0Zad Al-Ma`ad\xa0(5/773), Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) stated definitively that it is prohibited to sell cats, as he said: Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) issued a fatwa to that effect, and it is the view of Tawus, Mujahid, Jabir ibn Zayd and all the literalists, and it is one of two views narrated from Ahmad.\nIt is the correct view, because the Hadith narrated concerning that is sound and there is nothing to contradict it, therefore it must be followed. End quote.\nIbn Al-Mundhir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “If it is proven that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade selling cats, then the sale of cats is invalid, otherwise it is permissible.”\xa0(End quote from Al-Majmu`,\xa0 9/269)\nAnalyzing the Hadith prohibiting the sale of cats\nThe majority of scholars responded to this Hadith in three ways:\n\nBy noting that what is proven is the prohibition on selling dogs; as for the word\xa0As-Sinnawr\xa0(cat) that is mentioned in the Hadith, it is an inauthentic addition.\n\nIbn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This report is only known from Ibn Luhay`ah from Abu Az-Zubayr, and Imam Ahmad did not accept the reports of Ma`qil from Abu Az-Zubayr. He said: They are similar to the Hadiths of Ibn Luhay`ah. These reports were examined and were found to be as Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) suggested. (End quote from\xa0Jami` Al-`Ulum wal-Hikam,\xa0p. 418)\nAt-Tirmidhi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “There are some problems in the chain of narration of this Hadith, and it is not valid with regard to the sale of cats.”\xa0(End quote from Sunan At-Tirmidhi,\xa02/568)\nAbu `Awanah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Regarding the reports which say that the sale of cats is not permissible, there is some doubt about their soundness and they are weak.”\xa0(End quote from Al-Mustakhraj,\xa012/336)\nIbn `Abd Al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Regarding anything that it is permissible to keep and benefit from, and it is useful, in principle it is permissible to buy and sell it, unless there is something (that is, a report) to disallow that, which we must accept if there is no report to the contrary regarding that issue. There is no sound report regarding the sale of cats, so the matter remains permissible.” (End quote from At-Tamhid,\xa08/403)\n\nBy noting that the Hadith refers to wild cats, not domesticated cats.\n\nAl-Khattabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Rather it is disliked because it is like something wild that cannot be controlled, and it is not possible to deliver it [if it is sold]. That is because the cat frequents people’s houses and goes around among them, then it keeps away from people for a while, and it is not like animals that can be tied up to a post, or like birds which are kept in cages. It may revert to being wild after having been tamed and may stay in the wilderness to the extent that it does not come near humans and no human can control it, so if the purchaser tries to keep it in his house or tie it with a rope or chain, he will not benefit from it.”\xa0(End quote from Ma`alim As-Sunan,\xa03/130)\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The scholars differed concerning that. Some of them regarded it as permissible and interpreted the Hadith which forbids it as referring to a cat in which there is no benefit, because most cats are aggressive, but if we find a domesticated cat that is useful, then the view that it is permissible to sell it is clearly sound, because there is some benefit in it.” (End quote from Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti`,\xa08/114)\n\nBy noting that the prohibition is in the sense of it being disliked, because the Lawgiver wanted people to be easy-going and exchange cats without selling them.\n\nAd-Dumayri (may Allah have mercy on him) said in\xa0Hayat Al-Hayawan\xa0(1/577): It was said that the prohibition is not stringent, so that people will get used to giving cats away and lending them, as is usually the case. (End quote)\nIbn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Some of the scholars interpreted the prohibition as referring to cats in which there is no benefit, such as wild cats and the like. Others said that it is only prohibited to sell them because selling them is greedy and undignified, since they are readily available and there is a need for them. Cats are always available, and there is no harm to people in giving away surplus cats, so being stingy in that regard is one of the worst of blameworthy characteristics. Hence it is not allowed to sell a cat and keep its price.”\xa0(End quote from Jami` Al-`Ulum wal-Hikam, p. 418).\nIn conclusion, there is some doubt about the soundness of the Hadith which prohibits selling cats. Even if it is sound, it is to be interpreted in the ways mentioned by the majority of scholars. One of these interpretations is that it is better not to do that. It is as if the Lawgiver wanted people to be easy-going and give cats without selling them.\nHowever, we should point out here that there is something wrong with what many people do, as they show a great deal of interest in keeping cats and other animals. Their mistake is going to extremes in buying them at extremely high prices, then going to great expense in caring for them, feeding them and seeking medical treatment for them, in a way that takes the matter beyond the limit of moderation and reasonable spending, as they go to extremes in extravagance and spending money in ways that are of no great benefit, wasting money in ways that serve no purpose, showing off, boasting and messing about.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/271520/is-it-prohibited-to-buy-a-cat
307202,"In one of my physics classes, I had a discussion with my professor about the five necessities, as he said that preserving life is more important than preserving faith, and I told him that preserving faith is more important. But he was not convinced of what I said, and he quoted as evidence the fact that Islam permits patients with chronic diseases (diabetes and so on) [to break the fast in Ramadan if fasting is dangerous for them]. He asked for evidence from the Qur’an and Sunnah, and for the views of senior jurists (such as Ibn Taymiyah, ash-Shafa‘i and other jurists) in order to be convinced. I would like you to give me these views, with commentary and sources.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe five necessities are: faith, life, reason, lineage and wealth. Some scholars also add: honour.\nAz-Zarkashi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: What is regarded as interest (maslahah) may be divided on the basis of how strong the interest is in and of itself, or in relation to the individual’s need for that interest, into the following categories: essential, needed or embellishment.\nFirstly, that which is essential is that which is needed and cannot be done without in the upholding of spiritual or worldly well-being, in the sense that if it is lacking, worldly affairs will not be sound and there will be corruption, turmoil and loss of life; and in the hereafter there will be no salvation or eternal bliss, and there will be clear loss.\nThat which is essential is that which helps to preserve one of the five objectives of sharia, which are:\nPreservation of faith, by legislating execution and fighting; execution for apostasy and other crimes that incur capital punishment serves the interest of Islamic faith, as does fighting in jihad those disbelievers who are at war with the Muslims.\nPreservation of life, by legislating legal retribution (qisas).\nPreservation of reason, by legislating the hadd punishment for consuming intoxicants.\nPreservation of lineage by prohibiting zina and legislating punishments for it.\nPreservation of wealth by imposing liability on the one who transgresses against it, and by cutting off the hand of the thief.\nThese objectives are summed up in the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{O Prophet, when the believing women come to you pledging to you that they will not associate anything with Allāh, nor will they steal, nor will they commit unlawful sexual intercourse, nor will they kill their children, nor will they fabricate any lie concerning that which is between their arms and legs [namely a child]}\xa0[Al-Mumtahanah 60:12].\nAt-Tufi al-Hanbali added a sixth objective, in which at-Taj as-Subki followed him, namely the preservation of honour (or reputation). People of reason usually offer their life and wealth to protect their honour and reputation, and the thing that is protected by sacrificing something that is a necessity is more likely to be a necessity itself. (End quote from Tashnif al-Masami‘ Sharh Jam‘ al-Jawami‘, 3/15)\nSecondly:\nThe well-known scholarly view is that preservation of faith takes precedence over preservation of life, hence jihad in Allah’s cause – which aims to preserve faith – is prescribed, even though it is possible that it will lead to loss of lives and wealth.\nAl-Jalal al-Mahalli said in Sharh Jam‘ al-Jawami‘ (3/322): That which is a necessity is that for which the need may reach such a level that makes it a necessity, such as preservation of faith. In that case, what is prescribed is to fight the disbelievers and punish those who promote innovations (bid‘ah). Then comes preservation of life, for which retaliatory punishment (qisas) is prescribed. Then comes preservation of reason, for which the hadd punishment for consumption of intoxicants is prescribed. Then comes preservation of lineage, for which the hadd punishment for zina is prescribed. Then comes preservation of wealth, for which the hadd punishments for theft and banditry is prescribed. Then comes preservation of honour, for which the hadd punishment for slander is prescribed. The author added this last point, as at-Tufi did, and he added it with the conjunction wa (“and”) so as to indicate that it is as important as wealth, whereas the four necessities mentioned before it are connected by the conjunction fa (translated here as “then comes”), which indicates that they appear in decreasing order of importance.\nHowever, this order of importance is subject to differences of scholarly opinion, and the order may differ when these ideas are implemented.\nIbn Amir al-Haj (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Preservation of faith, which is one of the necessities, is given precedence over all others when there is a conflict, because it is the greatest objective. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me}\xa0[Adh-Dhariyat 51:56].\nMoreover, the other objectives are sought for the sake of preserving faith, because the outcome of preserving faith is the most perfect of outcomes, for it has to do with attaining eternal bliss with the Lord of the Worlds.\nNext, precedence should be given to preserving life over preserving lineage, reason and wealth, because it is connected to the interest of faith, which can only be attained through acts of worship, and acts of worship are dependent upon the survival of the individual.\nNext, precedence should be given to preservation of lineage over the remaining objectives, because it is essential to the survival of the child. By prohibiting zina, there will be no mixing of lineages, so the child will be attributed to one person, who will take care of raising him and preserving his life, otherwise the child may be neglected and die, because he is not able to look after himself.\nNext, precedence should be given to preservation of reason over the preservation of wealth, because loss of reason may lead to loss of life, to the extent that when a person loses his reason, he begins to behave like an animal and becomes no longer accountable. If someone causes another person to lose his reason, a complete penalty is due, like the penalty incurred when a person’s life is lost, namely blood money (diyah).\nNext comes preservation of wealth. And it was said that preservation of wealth may be given precedence over preservation of faith, let alone preservation of life, reason and lineage, as more than one of the scholars narrated. It is more appropriate to give precedence to these four over preservation of faith, because they are rights that belong to the human being, and the human being is intolerant and stingy with regard to his rights, and he may be harmed if he misses out on these things, whereas faith and religious commitment are rights that belong to Allah, may He be exalted, and the rights of Allah are based on tolerance and forgiveness. Moreover, Allah is independent of means and is sublime, so He will not be harmed if some people fall short in their duties towards Him. One example of giving precedence to these things over preservation of faith is not attending Jumu‘ah and prayers in congregation, which are both religious matters, in order to preserve wealth, which is a worldly matter. Abu Yusuf said: Prayer may be interrupted for the sake of a dirham that you fear may be stolen from you. In the wording of the book al-Khulasah: If a dirham is stolen from a person or from someone else, he may interrupt his prayer, whether it is obligatory or supererogatory. (End quote from at-Taqrir wa’t-Tahbir, 3/231).\nThus you will realize that the view which gives precedence to preserving life is a sound view, and there is a great deal of proof to support it, such as the fact that it is permissible to utter words of disbelief when one is compelled to do so for the purpose of preserving one’s life, and that it is permissible to eat meat that was not slaughtered in the prescribed manner and to drink alcohol, when forced by necessity for the purpose of preserving one’s life. This is in addition to the fact that it is permissible not to attend Jumu‘ah and prayers in congregation if one fears for one’s life because of an enemy or a wild animal, and the like.\nAl-Amidi spoke at length in support of the view that precedence is to be given to preserving what is fundamental to faith, and he refuted the argument that suggests otherwise.\nAmong other things, he (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Their argument is that what is essential to preserving life takes precedence, on the grounds that the purpose of faith and belief is to fulfil the rights of Allah and the purpose of the other necessities is to preserve the rights of the human being. The rights of the human being may take precedence over the rights of Allah, may He be exalted, because they are based on stinginess and intolerance, whereas the rights of Allah are based on tolerance and ease. Allah, may He be exalted, will not be harmed if His rights are not fulfilled, therefore preserving the rights of the human being takes precedence over preserving the rights of the One Who will not be harmed if His rights are not fulfilled. Hence we give precedence to the rights of the human being over the rights of Allah, may He be exalted, on the grounds that if there is a conflict between the rights of Allah, may He be exalted, and the rights of the human being in a particular situation, and it is difficult to fulfil\xa0 both, as in the case of one who apostatised and killed someone deliberately and with malice aforethought, then we execute him in retribution (qisas) for murder, not for his disbelief (apostasy).\nMoreover, we give precedence to preserving life over preserving faith and religious duties, as we reduce the burden of the traveller by waiving two rak‘ahs [from the four-rak‘ah prayer] and excusing him from fasting, and we reduce the burden of the one who is sick by allowing him not to pray standing and not to fast. We also give precedence to preserving life over upholding the prayer in the case of having to save a drowning person. Even clearer than that is the fact that we give precedence to preserving wealth over preserving faith when we allow a person not to attend Jumu‘ah and prayer in congregation when there is the necessity to preserve the least amount of wealth, and we give precedence to the interests of the Muslims which have to do with allowing ahl adh-dhimmah to live among them over the preservation of faith, to the extent that we protect the life and wealth of the dhimmi, even though in other circumstances it is permissible to fight disbelievers.\nIn refutation of the above, we say: with regard to preservation of life, although it is connected to the rights of the human being with regard to some rulings, it is also connected to the rights of Allah, may He be exalted, with regard to other rulings. Therefore it is prohibited to kill oneself or to behave in ways that could lead to loss of one’s life. So giving precedence to either of them is to be determined by examining the rights of both, and there is nothing to prevent giving precedence to the rights of Allah or the rights of the human being in issues that have to do purely with the rights of Allah.\nWith regard to reducing the burden for the traveller and the one who is sick, it is not to be understood as giving precedence to preserving life over preserving one of the fundamentals of faith; rather it is giving precedence to preservation of life over one of the minor issues of faith, and the minor issues of a fundamental matter are not the same as the fundamental matter itself.\nMoreover, it is worth noting that the difficulty involved in praying two rak‘ahs when travelling is equal to the difficulty involved in praying four rak‘ahs when not travelling. Similarly, the difficulty involved in the sick person praying sitting is the same as the difficulty involved in his praying standing when he is in good health. So in principle, there is no difference.\nWith regard to fasting, the individual does not miss out on fasting completely; rather the fast is deferred until he is able to make it up.\nThe arguments mentioned above refute what they said regarding the scenario of saving a drowning person, not attending Jumu‘ah or prayers in congregation in order to preserve wealth, and allowing ahl adh-dhimmah to remain among the Muslims and protecting their lives and wealth. That is not because it serves the interests of the Muslims; rather it is so that the dhimmi may see the beauties of Islam and learn about the fundamentals of the faith, so that his heart will be softened towards it, in the hope that he will be guided. That is in the interests of faith and is not in the interest of anything else. (End quote from al-Ihkam fi Usul al-Ahkam, 4/275).\nTherefore, the difference of scholarly opinion regarding the order of importance of these objectives is valid, and each view has its proof and evidence.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/307202/the-five-necessities-and-the-difference-of-opinion-as-to-whether-preservation-of-faith-should-be-given-precedence-over-preservation-of-life
126692,Can you kindly tell me what kind of dress did Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to wear? Kindly quote the Hadith and the reference number with your answer?,"['Praise be to Allah.In the Sunnah, there are reports which describe several types of clothing that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to wear.\nTo sum up, the reports say that he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to wear whatever garments were readily available and were customary among his people. So he did not reject that which was available, he did not go to great lengths to obtain that which was not available, he did not wear anything that made him stand out from other people, and he did not restrict himself to wearing only one type of clothing. Rather he wore all kinds of fabric except silk, and all kinds of garments that were covering and beautiful.\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) compiled a summary of the Hadiths which describe the clothing of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), which we will quote here in brief. We will not burden the reader by quoting all the Hadiths which speak of this topic, as they may be found in the books of the Sunnah, and one may refer to them in the sections on clothing and adornment.\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nHe (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) had a turban [i.e., that which is wrapped around the head, as is the dress of ordinary people in some countries nowadays, such as Yemen and Sudan] that was called As-Sahab (“the cloud”), which he gave to `Ali. Under it he wore a cap (Qalansuwah).\nSometimes he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) wore the cap without the turban, and sometimes he wore the turban without the cap. When he put on the turban, he let the ends hang down between his shoulder blades, as Muslim narrated from `Amr ibn Hurayth (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: I saw the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on the minbar wearing a black turban, with its two ends hanging down between his shoulder blades.\nMuslim also narrated from Jabir ibn `Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) entered Makkah wearing a black turban. The Hadith of Jabir does not mention the end of the turban, which indicates that he did not always let the end hang down between his shoulder blades. It may be said that he entered Makkah wearing a battle dress and a cap of chain mail on his head, because in every situation he wore what was appropriate.\nHe (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) also wore a Qamis or chemise [which is like the thobes that are known nowadays and in some countries they are called Galabiyah]. This was the most beloved of garments to him. The sleeves came down to the wrists.\nHe also wore the Jubbah [which is an overgarment with wide sleeves that is open at the front and is worn over the thobe. It is similar to the Jubbah worn nowadays at Al-Azhar University. (Al-Mu`jam Al-Wasit, 1/104)].\nThe Farruj – which is like the Qaba’ [a garment that is worn over other garments and with a cummerbund or waist sash]. (Al-Mu`jam Al-Wasit, 2/713)]\nThe Farjiyyah [a loose, long-sleeved garment that is worn by religious scholars. (Al-Mu`jam Al-Wasit, 2/679)].\nWhen travelling, he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) wore a Jubbah with tight sleeves.\nHe (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) wore the Izar (waist-wrapper or lower garment) and Rida’ (upper garment) [these are the garments that people wear in ihram today]. Al-Waqidi said: His Rida’ and Burd (types of upper garment) were six cubits long and three cubits and a handspan wide. His Izar was made of Omani cloth; it was four cubits and a handspan long and two cubits and a handspan wide.\nHe (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) wore a red Hullah. The Hullah (suit) was composed of an Izar and Rida’; the word simply refers to two garments worn together. Those who thought that it was pure red, not mixed with any other colour, are mistaken. Rather the red suit was two pieces of Yemeni cloth woven with red and black stripes, like all Yemeni clothes. They were known by this name because they contained red stripes. Otherwise, pure red is emphatically disallowed.\nHe (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) wore both patterned and plain Khamisahs (woollen cloaks).\nHe (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) wore black garments.\nHe (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) wore a fur coat (made from animal pelt) edged with silk brocade\nImam Ahmad and Abu Dawud narrated with their chain of narrators from Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) that the ruler of Byzantium sent the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) a gift of a fur coat edged with fine silk, and he put it on.\nAs-Asma`i (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This refers to a fur coat with long sleeves. Al-Khattabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is likely that this fur coat was edged with silk brocade, because the fur coat itself cannot be made of silk brocade.\nHe (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) bought a pair of trousers, and what appears to be the case is that he only bought them in order to wear them. It is narrated in more than one Hadith that he wore trousers and they (the Companions) wore trousers with his permission.\nHe wore Khuffayn (leather slippers that come above the ankles) and he wore sandals that were called Tasumah.\nHe (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) wore rings; the Hadiths differ as to whether he wore his ring on his right hand or his left hand. All of the Hadiths have authentic chains of narration.\nHe wore a helmet, and he wore chainmail. On the day of Uhud he appeared wearing two garments of chainmail.\nMuslim narrated that Asma’ bint Abi Bakr (may Allah be pleased with her) said: This is the Jubbah (overgarment) of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and she brought out to me a Persian overgarment which had pockets lined with silk brocade and its sleeves were edged with silk brocade. She said: This was in `Aishah’s possession until she died, and when she died, I took it. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to wear it, and now we wash it for the sick and seek healing thereby.\nHe (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) had two green garments [Burdah – the Burdah is a striped garment that is open at the front. It is usually placed on the shoulders like an `Abayah but it is smaller. The wearer wraps himself up in it or lets it hang down; it is similar to the kisa’ (a mantle or wrap)]. He also had a black mantle, a felted red mantle, and a mantle made of goat hair.\nHis Qamis (chemise) was made of cotton; it was short and had short sleeves. As for these wide and long sleeves like saddlebags, neither he nor any of his companions wore such things at all, and that is contrary to his Sunnah; there is some doubt as to its permissibility, because it is akin to showing off.\nThe most beloved garment to him was the Qamis (chemise – thobe or Galabiyah) and Hibarah (a striped garment) – the Hibarah is a type of Burdah with some reddish colour.\nThe most beloved of colours to him was white, and he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “They (white garments) are the best of your garments, so wear them and shroud your dead in them.\nAl-Bukhari narrated from `A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that she brought out a felted Kisa’ (mantle) and an Izar made of heavy fabric and said: The soul of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was taken whilst he was wearing these.\nWith regard to the Taylasan (shawl) [which is a cover that is worn over the head and shoulders, or over the shoulders only, and is worn nowadays by many priests and Jewish rabbis – see Al-Mu`jam Al-Wasit (2/553)], there is no report to suggest that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) or any of his companions wore it. Rather it is proven in Muslim, in the Hadith of Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him), that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) mentioned the Dajjal and said: “He will emerge, accompanied by seventy thousand of the Jews of Asbahan, wearing Taylasans (shawls).” Anas saw a group of people wearing such shawls and said: How closely they resemble the Jews of Khaybar. Therefore a number of the earlier and later scholars regarded it as disliked to wear it.\nMost of the garments that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his companions wore were made of cotton, and sometimes they wore garments made of wool or linen. Shaykh Abu Is-haq Al-Asbahani (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated with an authentic chain of narration from Jabir ibn Ayyub that he said: As-Salt ibn Rashid entered upon Muhammad ibn Sirin wearing a Jubbah of wool, an Izar of wool and a turban of wool. Muhammad got upset with him and said: I think that some people wear wool and say that `Isa ibn Maryam wore it. But someone whose sincerity I do not doubt told me that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) wore linen, wool and cotton, and the Sunnah of our Prophet is more deserving of being followed.\nWhat Ibn Sirin (may Allah have mercy on him) meant by saying this is that some people think that wearing wool all the time is better than wearing other fabrics, so they make sure to wear it and they forbid themselves to wear anything else. Similarly, they strive to wear only one style of clothing, and they think that doing anything else is wrong. But what is wrong is restricting oneself to such a thing, adhering to it and never doing anything different.\nThe correct view is that the best path is the path of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that he followed, enjoined, encouraged and did all the time. His practice with regard to clothing was to wear whatever was easily available, sometimes wool, sometimes cotton, sometimes linen; he wore a Yemeni Burd (cloak) and a green Burd; he wore a Jubbah, Qaba’ (over-garment), Qamis (chemise or thobe/Galabiyah), trousers, Izar, Rida’, Khuff (leather slippers), and sandals; he let the end of his turban hang down from behind sometimes, and at other times he did not do that, and sometimes he brought part of the turban under his chin. When he bought a new garment he would mention it by name and say: “O Allah, You have given me this chemise/Rida’/turban to wear; I ask You for its goodness and the goodness for which it was made, and I seek refuge with You from its evil and the evil for which it was made.” And when he put on his chemise, he would start on the right.\nHe wore black goat hair, as Muslim narrated from `A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that she said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) went out wearing a striped garment made of black hair. It is narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim from Qatadah: We said to Anas: Which garments were most liked by the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)? He said: The Hibarah. The Hibarah was a Yemeni cloak. Most of their garments were made of Yemeni textiles, because Yemen was close to them. They sometimes wore things that were imported from greater Syria and Egypt, such as Qibati fabric which was woven from linen by the Copts (Egyptians).\nIn Sahih An-Nasa’i, it is narrated from `A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that she made for the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) a Burdah (cloak) of wool and he put it on, but when he sweated he noticed the smell of the wool, and he took it off, as he liked good smells. In Sunan Abu Dawud, it is narrated that `Abdullah ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I saw the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) wearing one of the best suits.\nIn Sunan An-Nasa’i, it is narrated that Abu Rimthah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I saw the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) delivering a speech wearing two green garments.\nThe green garment is a garment that has green stripes; it is exactly like the red Hullah (suit). Whoever thinks that the red Hullah was pure red should also say that the green garment was pure green, but no one says that.
