392583,"There is a website called sovrntur.com – the way it works is as follows: when you subscribe to it, you are permitted to watch 10 ads and what you earn from each ad is a small amount of money. The price of ten ads is ten liras. The next day, you are allowed to watch ten more ads, and what you earn from that is approximately another ten liras, so the total is twenty liras. We add details of our bank account, and we can withdraw 92% of the total amount, which will arrive on the same day. As for the rest of the days, we cannot open other ads except in return for depositing a certain amount of money on the website. For example, if we deposit 200 liras, then we can open ten ads every day in return for ten liras, more or less, based on the price of the displayed ad. If we deposit 600 liras, we can open ten ads in return for thirty liras, more or less, based on the price of the displayed ad, and so on. The ads change according to the amount of money deposited. Of course, the amount will be returned two months after the date of the deposit. On the day on which we click on ads we make money, and on the day on which we do not click on ads we do not make any money. What we make is based on our work in the website, otherwise there is no money. This is the nature of the work we do on the website. What is the ruling on that? Please note that I have already deposited money, and every day I earn enough to cover a little less than my daily expenses. I hope that you can explain the ruling on this website, and the ruling on depositing money on it. If it is haram, what should I do?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt is permissible to make money by clicking on ads, subject to two conditions:\n1.\xa0The ads should be permissible, because clicking on the ad and having a lot of visitors to it is regarded as promoting and supporting it, and it is not permissible to advertise, promote or help in spreading evils, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And cooperate in righteousness and piety, but do not cooperate in sin and transgression. And fear Allah ; indeed, Allah is severe in penalty}\xa0[al-Ma’idah 5:2].\nAnd the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “And whoever calls others to misguidance will have a burden of sin like that of those who follow it, without it detracting from their burden in the slightest.” Narrated by Muslim (2674).\nSo it is not permissible to click on ads for permissive websites, or sites that sell intoxicants, or riba-based banks, or gambling sites, or missionary sites [that promote Christianity], or other websites that spread and propagate what is haram.\n2.\xa0The fee or payment should be known, such as if it says that if you watch an ad or click on it, you will receive such and such. If the fee is unknown, then the contract is not valid.\nSecondly:\nIt is not permissible to deposit money on the website, because from an Islamic perspective this is regarded as giving a loan to the website, which borrows the money. Borrowing means taking the money to make use of it and benefit from it, with a commitment to return it. It is not permissible to stipulate that a loan be given when entering into a transaction such as buying and selling, hiring or renting, or when paying a fee for some work.\nAt-Tirmidhi (1234), Abu Dawud (3504) and an-Nasa’i (4211) narrated from ‘Amr ibn Shu‘ayb, from his father, from his grandfather, who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “It is not permissible to arrange a loan combined with a sale.” Classed as sahih by at-Tirmidhi and al-Albani.\nWhat applies to buying and selling also applies to all other business transactions.\nIt says in a statement of the Islamic Fiqh Council regarding margins: Secondly: if the broker stipulates a condition for the customer that all his business should be done through him, then this leads to combining a loan and brokerage deal, which is like combining a loan with a sale, and that is prohibited according to Islamic teachings, as the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “It is not permissible to arrange a loan combined with a sale…”\nThis hadith was narrated by Abu Dawud (3/384) and by at-Tirmidhi (3/526), who said: It is a hasan sahih hadith.\nIn this case, he will be benefitting from his loan, and the jurists are unanimously agreed that any loan that brings a benefit comes under the heading of riba, which is prohibited.\nTo conclude, it is not permissible to deposit money on the website, no matter what the amount of money.\nWhat you must do is repent and withdraw your money.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/392583/making-money-by-clicking-on-ads-when-it-is-stipulated-that-one-must-deposit-money-on-the-website
279825,"Which scholarly view is most likely to be correct regarding the definition of the types of wealth that are regarded as being subject to riba? The Maliki scholars stipulated that food that can be stored should be added to the list of types of wealth that are subject to riba, meaning food that can be dried and stored, and is not harmed by the passage of time. Is that condition waved nowadays, because we have large freezers that can store all types of food?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe types of wealth that are regarded as being subject to riba and were named in the religious texts are six, as mentioned in the hadith of ‘Ubadah ibn as-Samit (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Gold for gold, silver for silver, wheat for wheat, barley for barley, dates for dates, salt for salt, like for like, same for same, hand to hand. But if these commodities differ, then sell as you like, as long as it is hand to hand.” Narrated by Muslim (1587).\nThe jurists differed concerning the reason why these types of wealth are regarded as being subject to riba.\nWhat is most likely is that the reason in the case of gold and silver is the fact that other things are valued against them. The evidence for that is the report which was narrated by Muslim (1588) from Abu Hurayrah, according to which the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Dinar for dinar, with no difference [in quantity] between them, and dirham for dirham, with no difference between them.”\nThe reason in the case of the other four categories is that they are things that can be eaten that are measured by volume or by weight. So anything that can be eaten and is measured by volume or by weight is subject to riba. The evidence for that is as follows:\n1.\xa0These four things can be eaten and are measured by volume.\n2. Al-Bukhari (2302) narrated from Abu Sa‘id al-Khudri and Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with them both) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) employed a man in charge of Khaybar. He brought them some janib dates. [The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)] said: “Are all the dates of Khaybar like this?” He said: We buy one sa‘ of these for two sa‘s of the others [i.e., \xa0inferior dates], or two sa‘s of these for three sa‘s of the others. He said: “Do not do that. Sell the inferior dates for dirhams, then buy the janib dates with the dirhams.” And he said something similar about dates sold by weight.\nWhat is meant is that foods that are subject to riba are those that can be measured by weight or by volume.\n3.\xa0Muslim (1592) narrated from Ma‘mar ibn ‘Abdillah that he sent his slave with a sa‘ of wheat and he said: Sell it then buy barley with the proceeds. The slave went and exchanged it for a sa‘ and a little more. When he came to Ma‘mar he told him about that, and Ma‘mar said to him: Why did you do that? Go and give it back, and do not take anything except like for like, for I used to hear the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “Foodstuff for foodstuff, like for like.” And our food at that time was barley.\nThese hadiths, when taken together, indicate that the reason why these types of wealth are subject to riba is the fact that they can be eaten, in addition to the fact that they are measured by volume or weight.\nSo if a foodstuff can be measured by volume or weight, it is subject to riba; there is no stipulation that it should be something that can be stored.\nThis is the older view of ash-Shafa‘i, and was narrated in one report from Ahmad; it was also favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) and a number of other scholars.\nBased on that, there can be no riba in the case of vegetables or fruits that are sold by the piece, such as melons, pomegranates and the like. But milk and fats may be subject to riba because all liquids may be measured by volume.\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: With regard to dirhams and dinars [gold and silver], some scholars said: The reason why [they are subject to riba] is that they can be weighed. This is the view of Ahmad according to one of the two reports narrated from him, and it is the view of Abu Hanifah. Another group said that the reason for that is the fact that other things are valued against them. This is the view of ash-Shafa‘i, Malik and Ahmad, according to the other report narrated from him.\nThis is the sound view; in fact, it is the correct view. The scholars are agreed that it is permissible to exchange gold and silver for metals that can be weighed, such as copper, iron and so on. If copper and iron were subject to riba, it would not be permissible to sell them for dirhams to be paid now, with delivery to be made later. What may be subject to riba in that regard is if they differ in type; it is permissible for their weight to differ, but it is not permissible to sell them on credit [rather the exchange should take place on the spot].""(I‘lam al-Muwaqqi‘in 2/105).\nShaykh ‘Abdullah al-Bassam (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The scholars are unanimously agreed that the reason why gold and silver are regarded as subject to riba is different from the reason in the case of the other four types of wealth, and each of the two groups has its own reason. But they differed as to what that reason is.\nThe well-known view that was narrated from Imam Ahmad regarding gold and silver is because they are both types of wealth that may be measured by weight, and in the case of the other types of wealth, they may be measured by volume, and thus we may include with them other types of wealth that are similar to them.\nThis was the view of an-Nakha‘i, az-Zuhri, ath-Thawri, Ishaq and the Hanafis. Based on that, riba applies to anything that is measured by weight or by volume, and is exchanged for something of the same type, whether it is something that may be eaten, such as grains, sugar and fats, or it is something that cannot be eaten, such as iron, brass, copper, potash and so on. That which is not measured by volume or by weight is not subject to riba, even if it may be eaten, such as fruits that are sold by the piece.\nThe Shafa‘is were of the view that the reason why [these four types] are subject to riba is the fact that they are eaten and are exchanged for things of the same type, and the reason why gold and silver are subject to riba is the fact that other things are valued against them. Therefore the ruling is limited to them. The evidence for that is what was narrated by Muslim from Ma‘mar ibn ‘Abdillah, that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade selling foodstuff for foodstuff, except like for like.\nThus the ruling is connected to the fact that it is food, and this points to the reason why it is regarded as being subject to riba. Imam Malik agreed with ash-Shafa‘i with regard to gold and silver. As for other types of wealth, the reason in his view was that they are exchanged for goods of the same type, they can be stored and they are food. The same applies to what is added to food of spices.\nThey think that these four types are mentioned in the hadith by way of example, and include similar things, and what they have in common is the fact that they are all food and can be stored.\nHence wheat and barley are mentioned as examples of grains; dates are mentioned as an example of sweet things such as sugar and honey; and salt is mentioned as an example of all types of spices.\nThere is another view that was narrated from Imam Ahmad; it is the older view of Imam ash-Shafa‘i and is the view of Sa‘id ibn al-Musayyib, which is that the reason why the four things mentioned in the hadith are regarded as being subject to riba is that they are all things that may be eaten and are measured by volume or weight, so no food that cannot be measured by volume or weight is subject to riba, such as pomegranates, eggs and melons.\nSimilarly, things that cannot be measured by volume or by weight, and cannot be eaten, are not subject to riba. So these two factors must be taken into consideration, because being measured by volume on its own and being measured by weight on its own does not dictate that when these goods are exchanged they must be exactly the same in quantity. And the fact that something may be eaten alone does not dictate that when they are exchanged they must be exactly the same in quantity, because that is not what the shar‘i regulations state. Rather the stipulation that goods should be exchanged in the same quantity can only be applied in accordance with Islamic teachings, which refer to volume or weight.\nThis view reconciles between the hadiths that have been narrated concerning this matter, because one hadith is more specific than the other.\nThis view was favoured by the author of al-Mughni, the commentator ‘Abd ar-Rahman ibn Abi ‘Umar, and Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on them).""(Taysir al-‘Alam Sharh ‘Umdat al-Ahkam\xa0 1/478).\nSecondly:\nWhat matters with regard to determining whether something is to be measured by volume or by weight, or may be sold by the piece, is what was done at the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nThis is indicated by the hadith narrated by Abu Dawud (3340) and an-Nasa’i (2520) from Ibn ‘Umar, who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The (standard) measure (of weight) is the measure of the people of Makkah and the (standard) measure (of volume) is the measure of the people of Madinah.” Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/279825/the-most-likely-reason-why-six-types-of-wealth-are-regarded-as-being-subject-to-riba
98152,"What is the ruling on getting involved in Class A, B and C investment certificates?","['Praise be to Allah.The investment certificates that are issued by riba-based banks of all three types – Class A, B and C – are all haram.\nThe certificates are bonds which represent a loan with interest, and they vary according to type. Class A investment certificates bring interest that is a percentage. This interest is added to the basic value of the certificate, until the time for the certificate ends after ten years.\nGroup B investment certificates have a specified rate of interest which is paid every month, or every three months, or every six months, according to the terms of the agreement with the bank. The capital remains and is not subject to loss.\nBoth types are haram, because they are loans that are guaranteed, with guaranteed interest. They are not profit sharing (mudarabah) at all, and if they are described as profit sharing, it is invalid profit sharing.\nIslam does not allow profit sharing (mudarabah) in which the capital of the one who invests is guaranteed and in which the worker who does business with it is given a specified amount of money.\nIn a statement of the Islamic Fiqh Council, issued during its fourteenth session in Qatar, 8-13 Dhu’l-Qa‘dah 1423 AH (11-16 January 2003), it says:\nIt is well established that a loan with interest is different from an Islamically-acceptable mudarabah (profit-sharing) contract, as profit and loss are both borne by the borrower in the case of a loan. In the case of mudarabah, it is a partnership in which profits are shared, and losses are also shared if they occur, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever is liable for the product he is selling, the profit belongs to him.” Narrated by Ahmad and the authors of as-Sunan with a sahih isnad. In other words, whatever occurs of returns, growth and increase is only permissible for the one who will bear the consequences if the goods are destroyed, ruined or become defective. The jurists derived from this hadith the famous juristic principle: “The one who is entitled to profit is the one who will bear any loss.” Moreover, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade profit earned by trading in something for which one is not liable. Narrated by the authors of as-Sunan.\nThere is consensus among the jurists throughout the ages in all madhhabs that it is not permissible to define the profit of investment in mudarabah or any other partnership in terms of a specific amount or a percentage of the money invested – in other words, the capital – because that is guaranteeing the capital, which is contrary to the sahih religious texts and leads to no sharing of profit and loss, which is the very essence of partnerships and profit sharing. This consensus is proven and well established, because there is no report to indicate any contrary view. Concerning that, Ibn Qudamah said in al-Mughni (3/34): The scholars from whom we acquired knowledge are unanimously agreed that mudarabah contracts are rendered invalid if one or both parties stipulates that he will receive a specific number of dirhams. Scholarly consensus is valid proof in and of itself.\nAs the Council is citing this consensus, it urges the Muslims to seek halal earnings and to avoid haram earnings in obedience to Allah, may He be exalted, and His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). End quote.\nNo rate of interest is specified in Class C investment certificates, and the investor has the right to claim back the value of the certificate whenever he wishes. The certificate also qualifies him to enter into a regular draw of the numbers of the certificates. This draw is stipulated in the contract with the one who purchases the certificate, meaning that were it not for this draw he would not have joined the program for this type of certificate. This is what dictates that the ruling on it is that it is in fact based on riba, like the other two classes of certificates, and that it is included in the general principle which says that “Every loan that brings a benefit is riba.”\nThe scholars of the Permanent Committee were asked:\nThe National Bank of Egypt issues Class C investment certificates, which are certificates that you buy from the bank, and there is a monthly draw on the purchased certificates. The certificate that is drawn wins a large amount of money, whilst the certificate holder retains the right to return the certificate to the bank and claim its value at any time. What is the Islamic ruling on this huge amount of money that the holder of the winning certificate receives?\nThey replied:\nIf the matter is as described, this transaction is a kind of gambling, and it is a major sin, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{O you who have believed, indeed, intoxicants, gambling, [sacrificing on] stone alters [to other than Allah], and divining arrows are but defilement from the work of Satan, so avoid it that you may be successful.\nSatan only wants to cause between you animosity and hatred through intoxicants and gambling and to avert you from the remembrance of Allah and from prayer. So will you not desist?}\xa0[al-Ma’idah 5:90-91].\nThe one who has engaged in such transactions must repent to Allah and seek His forgiveness; he must stop engaging in such transactions and get rid of whatever he has acquired through them, in the hope that Allah will turn to him in mercy.

The statement reads as follows:\nIn the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\nPraise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds, and blessings and peace be upon Sayyiduna Muhammad, the Last of the Prophets, and on his family and companions.\nStatement no. 62/11/6, regarding bonds:\nThe Islamic Fiqh Council during its sixth session and conference in Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, 17-23 Sha‘ban 1410 AH (14-20 March 1990 CE), after studying the papers, recommendations and conclusions submitted in the symposium on financial markets that was held in Rabat, 20-24 Rabi‘ ath-Thani 1410 AH (20-24 October 1989), in cooperation with this Council and the Islamic Institute for Research and Training of the Islamic Development Bank, hosted by the Ministry of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs in the Kingdom of Morocco,\nand after learning that the bond is a certificate which states that the issuer is committed to pay the bearer the nominal value when it becomes due, in addition to interest on the nominal value of the bond as agreed upon, or giving some other benefit as stipulated – whether it is prizes distributed by a draw, or a stated amount of money, or a discount,\nthe Council has determined the following:\n1.\xa0Bonds which represent a commitment to repay the amount with accrued interest, or a stipulated amount are prohibited according to Islamic law, in terms of issuing, buying or trading, because they are riba-based loans, regardless of whether the issuing organisation is private or public, belonging to the state. It makes no difference whether they are called investment certificates or savings certificates pr theriba-based returns are called profit, income, brokerage or returns.\n2.\xa0Zero-coupon bonds are also prohibited, because they are loans that are sold for less than their nominal value, and the purchasers benefit from the difference, as it is regarded as a discount on these bonds.\n3.\xa0Bonds that may win prizes are also prohibited, because they come under the heading of loans in which a benefit or increase is stipulated for a number of lenders, or one of them, but without specifying. That is in addition to the resemblance to gambling.\n4.\xa0Alternatives to bonds that are haram – whether in terms of issuing them, buying them or dealing in them – are bonds that are based on profit sharing investment in a project, or specific investment activities, in which there is no interest paid to holders and there is no specific benefit for them; rather they will have a percentage of the profits of the project, commensurate with what they own of these bonds, and they will not receive any profit unless there actually is any.\nYou can learn more from what is mention in statement no. 5 of the 4th session of this council.
