184901,"I would like to ask about this man who leads the Naqshabandi Sufi tariqah, Nazim al-Haqqani. What advice can you give us on interacting with him and others like him?","['Praise be to Allah.This man, who is called Muhammad Nazim al-Haqqani an-Naqshabandi is one of the leading figures of the Naqshabandi Sufis. He used to live in Cyprus, and he had followers in Europe, America, East Asia and elsewhere. He died in 1435 AH.\nHe wrote a number of books about the Naqshabandi tariqah.\nBy researching his case, we find that he fell into many problematic matters, including the following:\nHis promotion of blatant shirk. In one of his lessons, he said: “We should not address the Lord of Glory directly, but we can address the qutub (a high-ranking wali or ‘saint’) who is in control.” Then he said: “The aqtab (plural of qutub) are men of Allah; they look at al-Lawh al-Mahfuz and control the affairs of the world, especially our master the qutub who is in control.”\nSee this at 5.00 in the video via the following link.\nThis is associating others with Allah in His Lordship (shirk ar-rububiyyah) and associating others with Him in worship. Believing that there is someone in control alongside Allah, may He be exalted, is associating someone else with Him in His Lordship, and believing that it is not permissible to call upon Allah, may He be exalted, directly, and that one must call upon Him through the aqtab is associating others with Allah in His divinity (shirk al-uluhiyyah).\nThis type of shirk is widespread among the Sufis.\nMuhammad az-Zamzami al-Maghrebi (may Allah have mercy on him) – who was a Sufi, then Allah guided him to Tawheed and the Sunnah – said, speaking of the innovations of the Sufis: One of them is their claim that the awliya’ (“saints”) are in control of running the affairs of the universe, so they give to some and withhold from others, they honour some and humiliate others, and they appoint people to positions of authority and dismiss others therefrom. Because of this corrupted belief, the Sufis turn to those who they believe are awliya’ and ask them to meet their needs, and they say: These are our intercessors with Allah; we ask of them and they intercede for us with Allah! And when they visit their graves, they recite a line of verse:\n“You are the door and Allah is most generous; whoever comes to you, his wishes will be met and he will be given generously.”\nThis belief is the same as the polytheists’ belief regarding their idols which they worshipped. They said: We only worship them so that they will intercede for us with Allah to meet our needs. Allah tells us about them in the Holy Quran (interpretation of the meaning):\n{ And they worship other than Allah that which neither harms them nor benefits them, and they say, ""These are our intercessors with Allah "" Say, ""Do you inform Allah of something He does not know in the heavens or on the earth?"" Exalted is He and high above what they associate with Him}\xa0[Yoonus 10:18].\nAllah states here that they are lying when they say that. Because of this innovation, the graves of the dead have become places of visitation to which ignorant people go when calamity strikes, and they go to some of them to ask for children, or to seek healing from sickness. Thus the graves have become like idols which are worshipped besides Allah.\nEnd quote from az-Zawiyah wa ma fiha min al-A‘mal wa’l-Bida‘ al-Munkarah (p.50).\nOne of this man’s actions that are contrary to Islam is that – in addition to saying that Allah cannot be asked directly, rather He must be asked through the aqtab – in a recorded meeting with the Pope of the Catholic Church, Benedict XVI, Nazim al-Haqqani asked the pope to pray for him! This is indicative of how far these misguided people have drifted away from the religion of Islam and sound human nature. For he forbids addressing Allah directly, then he asks the leader of the misguided Christians to pray for him!\nSee the meeting via the following link:\nThis also indicates that he is very ignorant of the belief in loyalty to the believers and disavowal of the disbelievers (al-wala’ wa’l-bara’), as he is very gentle with the Christian pope and one of his students kisses the pope’s hand in front of him, but he is stern with those whom he calls Wahhabis and Salafis, whom he reviles in crude terms. This confirms what some researchers have stated, that Sufism, by lending support to the disbelieving tyrants, was one of the causes of the Muslim ummah’s decline.\nYou can see him reviling the Wahhabis via this link.\nAnother of his misguided notions that is that he says that he is one of those whom the Most Gracious has ransomed from the Fire of Hell, and that the angel who is on his right records his good deeds, whereas the angel who is on his left does not record anything!\nAnother example of his misguidance is what happens in his gatherings of dancing. May Allah have mercy on Imam Ibn al-Qayyim, who said in verse:\n“When the Quran is recited, they sit still, not out of fear of Allah but like one whose mind is wandering.\nWhen the singing starts, they are like donkeys braying; by Allah, their dancing is not for the sake of Allah.\nDrum and flute and the melodious voice of a singer; when have you ever seen any kind of worship with music and entertainment?”\nSimilar to that is what happens in his gatherings of mixing between men and women, and the attendance of women who are uncovered and wearing make-up, and they kiss his hand. There are video clips which confirm that, but we do not want to share links here.\nThis is with regard to the man himself.\nAs for the ruling concerning him:\nIt may be said that he has undoubtedly fallen into some serious and grievous innovations, some of which could lead to him being deemed a disbeliever, and others of which are less serious than that. He and his group are among the most misguided of people, and you must warn people against him and against his group, pointing out their misguidance with wisdom. This is part of being sincere towards Allah and His Messenger. Otherwise, ruling that he himself is to be deemed a disbeliever depends on whether the conditions of doing that are met and the impediments to doing so are absent, as is the principle set out by Ahl as-Sunnah wa’l- Jama‘ah with regard to deeming someone to be a disbeliever.

216483,"Is love for the sake of Allah and doing what is dictated thereby an act of worship that will bring one closer to Allah, may He be exalted? Is it equivalent to nafl (supererogatory) acts of worship or Hajj, as al-Hasan al-Basri said to someone: “O A’mash, do you not know that going and putting effort into helping your brother is like performing Hajj after Hajj?” Did he say that to him by way of simply motivating him, or is the reward for it actually as he said? How can a person reach such a level with the one whom he loves for the sake of Allah that he will stand in the shade of the Most Gracious and reach a point where Allah’s love becomes due to both of them?","[""Praise be to Allah.Importance of love for the sake of Allah\nLove for the sake of Allah is one of the strongest bonds of faith, and is one of the most important foundations on which Muslim society is based. It is the basis by means of which ties of friendship and harmony among people are attained, so that they love one another, visit one another, are sincere towards one another, intermarry, enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong, thus attaining true Islamic brotherhood. Through it people find the sweetness of faith in their interactions, companionship and friendship.\nAhmad (18524) narrated from al-Bara’ ibn `Aazib, that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Indeed the strongest bond of faith is to love for the sake of Allah and hate for the sake of Allah.” (Classed as hasan by the commentators on Al-Musnad; also classed as hasan by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Targhib (3030).\nLove for the sake of Allah is one of the greatest acts of worship and one of the best of righteous deeds.\nAl-Bukhari (13), Muslim (45), and An-Nasa’i (5017) narrated from Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “By the One in Whose Hand is the soul of Muhammad, no one of you truly believes until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself of good.”\nAl-Hafiz ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Al-Kirmani said: It is also part of faith to hate for his brother what he hates for himself of evil.” (Fath Al-Bari (1/58)\nIf faith, which is obligatory, is not complete unless one loves good for one’s fellow Muslim and hates evil for him, then loving the Muslim himself and being allied with him is more important and is of a higher level.\nAuthenticity of the Hadith “Do you not know that your going and striving to help your brother is better for you than performing Hajj after Hajj?”\nIbn Abi Dunya narrated in Qada’ Al-Hawa’ij (103) and in Istina’ Al-Ma`ruf (163) via Al-Hakam ibn Sinan: Malik ibn Dinar told us: Al-Hasan sent Muhammad ibn Nuh and Humayd At-Tawil on an errand for his brother, and said: Tell Thabit Al-Bunani to come to me with you. Thabit said to them: I am in seclusion worshipping my Lord (i'tikaf). Humayd went back to Al-Hasan and told him what Thabit had said, and he (Al-Hasan) said to him: Tell him: Do you not know that your going and striving to help your brother is better for you than performing Hajj after Hajj?\nThis is a weak isnad. Al-Hakam ibn Sinan is weak in hadith; he was classed as weak by Ibn Ma`in, An-Nasa’i, Ibn Sa`d, Abu Dawud and others. Ibn Hibban said: He is one of those who were sole narrators of fabricated hadiths from trustworthy narrators, so no attention should be paid to him.” ((Tahdhib At-Tahdhib (2/367)\nEven if we assume that it is sound, it may be understood as being by way of emphasizing and encouraging people to go about helping Muslims with what they need.\nMore sound than that is the hadith of Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “To go about with a brother of mine, trying to help him, is dearer to me than spending a month in seclusion (i’tikaf) in this mosque of mine. The one who goes about with his Muslim brother, trying to help him, until he meets his needs, Allah will make his feet steadfast on the Day when feet will slip.” (Narrated by At-Tabarani (13646), Ibn Bashran in Al-Amali, and others, classed as hasan by Al-Albani in As-Sahihah (906)\nIn Az-Zuhd (746), Ibn Al-Mubarak narrated that Abu Ja`far said:\n“A man came to Husayn ibn `Ali to seek his help, and he found him in seclusion for worship. He said: Were it not for being in seclusion, I would have gone out with you and helped you with what you need. Then the man left and went to Al-Hasan ibn `Ali, and told him what he needed, and he went out with him and helped him. The man said: I did not like to bother you and ask for your help, but I started with Husayn and he said, Were it not for being in seclusion, I would have gone out with you. Al-Hasan said: To help a brother in faith of mine is dearer to me than secluding myself in worship for a month.\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Helping Muslims with what they need is more important than secluding oneself for worship, because helping them benefits others and yourself, and doing something that benefits others and yourself is better than doing something that benefits only yourself, except when the deed that only benefits oneself is one of the obligatory and essential duties of Islam.” (Majmu` Fatawa wa Rasa’il Al-`Uthaymin (20/180)\nReward for love for the Sake of Allah\nAmong the seven whom Allah will shade with His shade on the Day when there will be no shade but His are “two men (people) who love one another for the sake of Allah, meeting and parting on that basis”, as it says in the sahih hadith on which the scholars are agreed.\nAhmad (22002) narrated from `Ubadah ibn As-Samit that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “[Allah says:] `My love is due for those who love one another for My sake; My love is due for those who visit one another for My sake; My love is due for those who help one another for My sake; My love is due for those whose hearts are free of grudges and who uphold ties with one another for My sake.’” (Classed as sahih by Al-Albani in Sahih Al-Jami` (4321)\nIt is possible to attain these high levels by means of sincere love for one’s brother, intending it solely for the sake of Allah, cooperating in righteousness and piety on a basis of love, sincerely advising one another to do good, getting together to do acts of worship, and casting away evil and inappropriate words and deeds; and by loving for your brother what you love for yourself, hating for him what you hate for yourself, sharing his joys and sorrows, helping him to obey Allah, helping him in matters of concern to him having to do with this world or the Hereafter, defending him in his absence, not hesitating to help him or any of his family members, speaking well of him, concealing his faults, not backbiting about him, and not telling lies about him; and by treating him as well as you would treat your own brother, if not better than that.\nTo sum up, you should treat him in all good ways that you would like to be treated yourself, in word and in deed, in his absence and in his presence.\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/216483/does-love-for-the-sake-of-allah-bring-you-closer-to-allah

13180,Can you please tell me what is the correct procedure for giving debt (Lending money to a person)?,"[""Praise be to Allah.The correct way of lending money in Islam\nThe correct way of lending money is that mentioned by Allah in Surah Al-Baqarah, in the verse on debt, where Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“O you who believe! When you contract a debt for a fixed period, write it down. Let a scribe write it down in justice between you. Let not the scribe refuse to write as Allah has taught him, so let him write. Let him (the debtor) who incurs the liability dictate, and he must fear Allah, his Lord, and diminish not anything of what he owes. But if the debtor is of poor understanding, or weak, or is unable to dictate for himself, then let his guardian dictate in justice. And get two witnesses out of your own men. And if there are not two men (available), then a man and two women, such as you agree for witnesses, so that if one of them (two women) errs, the other can remind her. And the witnesses should not refuse when they are called (for evidence). You should not become weary to write it (your contract), whether it be small or big, for its fixed term, that is more just with Allah; more solid as evidence, and more convenient to prevent doubts among yourselves, save when it is a present trade which you carry out on the spot among yourselves, then there is no sin on you if you do not write it down. But take witnesses whenever you make a commercial contract. Let neither scribe nor witness suffer any harm, but if you do (such harm), it would be wickedness in you. So be afraid of Allah; and Allah teaches you. And Allah is the All-Knower of each and everything.\nAnd if you are on a journey and cannot find a scribe, then let there be a pledge taken (mortgaging), then if one of you entrusts the other, let the one who is entrusted discharge his trust (faithfully), and let him be afraid of Allah, his Lord. And conceal not the evidence, for he who hides it, surely, his heart is sinful. And Allah is All-Knower of what you do.” [Al-Baqarah 2:282-283]\nSo the correct way of lending money is:\xa0\n\nTo specify the period of the loan, i.e., the length of time after which the loan must be repaid.\nTo write down the loan and the time when it is to be repaid.\nIf the one who writes down the loan is a person other than the debtor, then the debtor is the one who should dictate to him the details of the loan.\nIf the debtor is unable to dictate because of sickness or some other reason, then the one who should dictate on his behalf is his guardian.\nThe loan should be witnessed, and the witnesses should be two men, or one man and two women.\nThe lender has the right to ask the borrower to guarantee the loan with a pledge which the lender will keep. The benefit of the pledge is that if the time comes for the debt to be repaid and the borrower refuses to pay, the item in pledge may be sold and the debt paid with that money; anything left over is to be given to the owner of the pledge, namely the debtor.\n\nIs it necessary to write down the loan in Islam?\nGuaranteeing a debt in one of these three ways (writing, witnesses or pledge) is recommended and is preferable, but it is not obligatory. Some of the scholars are of the view that it is obligatory to write down a loan, but most of the scholars say that it is recommended, and this is the more correct view. (See Tafsir Al-Qurtubi, 3/383)\nThe reason for that is to protect people’s rights so that they will not be exposed to loss because of forgetfulness or confusion, and as a precaution against those who do not fear Allah.\xa0\nIf a loan is not written down and not witnessed, and no pledge is taken, that does not mean that it is a sin. The verse itself indicates that:\xa0\n“then if one of you entrusts the other, let the one who is entrusted discharge his trust (faithfully), and let him be afraid of Allah, his Lord.” [Al-Baqarah 2:283 – interpretation of the meaning]\nTrust means not guaranteeing the loan by writing it down, having it witnessed or asking for a pledge. But in this case it is essential to fear Allah. Hence in this case Allah commanded the one who is in debt to fear Allah and discharge his trust: “let the one who is entrusted discharge his trust (faithfully), and let him be afraid of Allah, his Lord”. (See Tafsir As-Sa`di, 168-172)\xa0\nIf the loan is not written down and the debtor denies it or takes a long time to repay it, then the lender has no one to blame but himself, because he exposed his property to loss. It was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that if a loan is not written down, the Du’a’ of the lender against the debtor will not be accepted if he takes too long to pay or he denies the loan. He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There are three who call upon Allah but their prayer will not be answered:… a man who lent money to another man but he did not have (the loan) witnessed.” (Sahih Al-Jami`, 3075)\xa0\nWhoever thinks about these rulings and others will see the perfection of the Islamic Shari`ah and how concerned it is to protect people’s rights and not expose them to loss. For Allah commands the one who has wealth to protect it and not to expose it to loss, no matter how little it may be:\xa0\n“You should not become weary to write it (your contract), whether it be small or big, for its fixed term.” [Al-Baqarah 2:282 – interpretation of the meaning]\nIs there any other law that combines the interests of this world and the Hereafter in such a perfect way as the Islamic Shari`ah does?\xa0\nCould anyone come up with anything more perfect than these rulings?\xa0\nAllah the Almighty indeed spoke the truth when He said (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And who is better in judgement than Allah for a people who have firm Faith.” [Al-Ma'idah 5:50]\nWe ask Allah to make us steadfast in adhering to His religion until we meet Him adhering to it.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad and grant him peace.\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 74986 , 148458 , 49015 , and 50016 .""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13180/what-is-the-correct-way-of-lending-money-in-islam
