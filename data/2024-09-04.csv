514686,Is it permissible to respond to a person who says “Welcome” by saying “May Paradise welcome you”? Is it valid to say this?,"['Praise be to Allah.When someone says “welcome” (or “hello”), you should say something similar or better than it, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {When you are given a greeting, respond with a better greeting, or [at least] with the like thereof. Verily, Allah takes careful account of all things} [an-Nisa’ 4:86].\nThe phrase translated from Arabic here may be translated as a statement (“Paradise will welcome you”); this it is a lie and it is not permissible to say it.\nBut if it is by way of supplication (“May Paradise welcome you”) – which is what appears to be the case – praying that Paradise will welcome him, we do not know that Paradise itself will welcome those who will enter it. Rather the angels will welcome the people of Paradise, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Those who feared their Lord will be ushered to paradise in groups until, when they reach it, they will find its gates wide open, and its keepers will say to them: Peace be upon you; you have done well, so enter it, to abide herein forever}\xa0[az-Zumar 39:73].\nAnd Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{gardens of perpetual abode, which they will enter together with the righteous among their forebears, their spouses, and their offspring. Angels will enter unto them from every gate [saying]:\nPeace be upon you because you patiently persevered. How excellent is the ultimate end!}\xa0[ar-Ra‘d 13:23-24]\n{The greatest terror will not grieve them; and the angels will welcome them [saying]: This is your day, that you were promised}\xa0[al-Anbiya’ 21:103].\nMatters of the unseen are tawqeefi [meaning that they are to be based on the religious texts of the Qur’an and saheeh Sunnah, and are not subject to ijtihad], and cannot be spoken of except on the basis of evidence.\nAs there is no evidence to prove that Paradise will welcome its people, it is better not to say that, because there is the fear that this may be overstepping the mark in supplication.\nAbu Dawud (96), Ibn Majah (3894) and Ahmad narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn Mughaffal heard his son saying: O Allah, I ask You for the white palace on the right-hand side of Paradise, if I enter it. He said: O my son, ask Allah for Paradise and seek refuge with Him from Hell, for I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “There will be people in this ummah who will overstep the mark in purification and supplication.” This hadith was classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud.\nTherefore you should not say that, and you should use the well-known words of greeting and welcoming people.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/514686/what-is-the-ruling-on-greeting-a-person-by-saying-may-paradise-welcome-you
5163,Does iddah imply when it is the woman who is seeking the divorce (khul`)?,"['Praise be to Allah.What is Khul`?\nKhul` – in principle – can only occur at the request of the wife, and with the husband’s subsequent agreement to end the marriage.\xa0\nWhen does `Iddah become obligatory?\n`Iddah is obligatory upon every woman who leaves her husband, or whose husband leaves her, whether the cause is divorce, annulment of the marriage or the death of the husband, except when the divorce occurs before the marriage has been consummated, in which case the woman does not have to observe `Iddah, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“O you who believe! When you marry believing women, and then divorce them before you have sexual intercourse with them, no `Iddah [divorce prescribed period] have you to count in respect of them” [Al-Ahzab 33:49]\xa0\nIs `Iddah Necessary after Khul`?\nWith regard to the `Iddah following Khul`, the correct scholarly view is that it is one menstrual cycle, as is indicated by the Sunnah.\xa0\nIt was narrated from Ibn `Abbas that the wife of Thabit ibn Qays ended her marriage to her husband by means of Khul` at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded her to observe an `Iddah of one menstrual cycle. (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 1185 and Abu Dawud, 2229. It was also narrated by An-Nasa’i (3497) from the Hadith of Ar-Rabi` bint `Afra’. The two Hadiths were both classed as authentic by Ibn Al-Qayyim, as we shall see below).\xa0\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\nIn the fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded the woman who ended her marriage to her husband by Khul` to observe an `Iddah of one menstrual cycle, there is evidence for two rulings:\xa0\nThe first is that she does not have to wait for three menstrual cycles, rather one menstrual cycle is sufficient. Just as this is clearly the Sunnah, it was also the view of Amir Al-Mu’minin `Uthman ibn `Affan, `Abdullah ibn `Umar ibn Al-Khattab, Ar-Rabi’ bint Mu`awwadh and her paternal uncle, who was one of the greatest Companions. We do not know of anyone who held a different opinion, as Al-Layth ibn Sa`d narrated that Nafi` the freed slave of Ibn `Umar heard Al-Rabi` bint Mu`awwadh ibn `Afra’ telling\xa0 `Abdullah ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that she had ended her marriage to her husband by Khul` at the time of `Uthman ibn `Affan, and her paternal uncle had come to `Uthman ibn `Affan and said, The daughter of Mu`awwadh ended her marriage to her husband by Khul` today, so should she move (from the marital home)?\xa0 `Uthman said, She should move, and there is no inheritance between them, and she does not have to observe any `Iddah, but she should not remarry until one menstrual cycle has passed, lest she be pregnant. `Abdullah ibn `Umar said: and `Uthman was the best of us and the most knowledgeable.\xa0\nThis view was also shared by Is-haq ibn Rahawayh and Imam Ahmad, according to one report narrated from him. It was also the view favoured by Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah.\xa0\nThose who supported this view said: this is in accordance with the principles of Shari`ah. The `Iddah (in the case of divorce) was made three menstrual cycles in order to lengthen the time during which the husband may take back his wife, so that the husband will have enough time to rethink the matter and to be able to take his wife back during this time.\xa0\nBut in the case of Khul`, the wife is not going to go back and the purpose is simply to establish whether she is pregnant or not, so one menstrual cycle is sufficient. They said: this does not contradict the ruling that the `Iddah for a woman divorced by Talaq is three months. In the case of divorce the `Iddah is the same whether it is a final divorce or a revocable divorce .” (\xa0Zad Al-Ma`ad, 5/196, 197)\n\xa0Some scholars said that the `Iddah for a woman who ends her marriage to her husband by Khul` is three menstrual cycles, as in the case of one who is divorced by Talaq , but this was expertly refuted by Imam Ibn Al-Qayyim, who said:\n“What indicates that Khul` is not the same as divorce is the fact that in the case of a revocable divorce after consummation of the marriage, there are specific rulings which are not applicable in the case of Khul`.\n\nThat the husband has more right to take her back.\nWhen the husband issues a divorce, is it counted as one of three, and after the third it is not permissible for the wife to go back to him until she has been married to another man and that marriage has been consummated.\n`Iddah in the case of divorce is three menstrual cycles.\n\n\xa0So the `Iddah in the case of Khul` is what is indicated by the Sunnah, namely one menstrual cycle.\n\xa0And Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/5163/is-iddah-necessary-after-khul
500984,"Is it essential to memorise chains of narrations in the order of their hadiths, or is it sufficient to remember the names of the narrators?","['Praise be to Allah.The importance of the isnad (chain of narration) in determining which reports are sound and distinguishing them from those which are weak or false is well known.\nAl-Hakim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWere it not for the isnads and the hadith scholars seeking out the isnad for every hadith, and their extreme care in memorizing and preserving the isnads, the teachings of Islam would have been lost and the heretics and innovators would have been able to fabricate hadiths and tamper with the isnads. If the reports did not have isnads, they would be of no benefit.""(Ma‘rifat ‘Ulum al-Hadith\xa0 p. 115).\nAl-Qadi ‘Iyad (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nYou should understand, first of all, that the basis of the hadith is the isnad; through it the soundness of the hadith can be proven and it can be established whether the isnad is uninterrupted.""(Al-Ilma‘\xa0 p. 267).\nThus it becomes clear that learning the chains of narration through which the hadith texts were narrated, and studying them, is not essential for everyone. Rather it is required of the one who wants to learn the science of hadith and specialize in it, so that he can acquire the ability to distinguish between hadith reports and determine which are sound and which are weak. Such a person must pay attention to learning the isnads, either by memorizing them or constantly referring to the books of hadith in which the isnads are shown and researching the narrators of each hadith, until he develops skills and acquires knowledge of the narrators of hadith. The one who is ignorant about the narrators and lacks the skills to critique hadiths cannot be a scholar of hadith, no matter how much he memorizes of the texts.\nShaykh ‘Abd ar-Rahman al-Mu‘allimi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nA man cannot be called a scholar until he acquires knowledge and information about the narrators of hadith. In Tadrib ar-Rawi it says: Ar-Rafa‘i and others said: When the word scholar is mentioned, that will exclude those who hear the hadith but have no knowledge of the chains of narrators or the names of narrators.\nAz-Zarqani said: As for the scholars, in their view the title of hadith scholar (muhaddith) cannot be given to anyone except one who has memorized the texts of the hadith and knows the character of the narrators and is able to critique them.\nAt-Taj as-Subki said: … The hadith scholar is the one who knows the isnads and how to critique them, and knows the names of the narrators.\nIt was narrated from al-Mizzi that he was asked about who deserves to be called a hadith scholar, and he said: At a minimum, the number of narrators whom he knows, along with their biographies, circumstances and countries where they lived should be greater than the number of those whom he does not know, so that he can evaluate the hadith.\nSo the scholar needs to know the circumstances of those narrators who are his contemporaries, either by finding out about them directly or finding out about them from what trustworthy scholars have said about them. And he needs to learn about the character and circumstances of those narrators who came before him from what trustworthy scholars said about them, or from what trustworthy scholars narrated from other trustworthy scholars, and so on. And he must memorize all of that as he must memorize the hadith and its isnads. Thus some of them memorized thousands of hadiths, some of them memorized tens of thousands, and some of them memorized hundreds of thousands, along with their isnads.\nEnd quote from Muhadarah fi ‘Ilm ar-Rijal wa Ahammiyatuhu – in Athar al-Mu‘allimi (15/227).\nUndoubtedly, memorizing the isnads of hadiths as they appear in the books of hadith is better and more appropriate than memorizing the names on their own. That is for many reasons, the most important of which are:\n1.. Memorizing the hadith with its isnad, as it was narrated, helps one to remember the status of this hadith and whether it is sound or weak.\n2.. The one who memorizes the isnads as they are will acquire knowledge of the different levels or generations of the narrators, so he will learn about the shaykhs and students of each narrator. Learning about the levels or generations of the narrators is important, as is well known among specialists in this field, and it can solve many issues.\nAl-‘Iraqi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIt is important to learn about the levels and generations of narrators, because there may be two narrators with identical names, and one may think that only one person is referred to. But you can distinguish between them when you know the level or generation to which each of them belong, if they are of different levels. If they belonged to the same level or generation, the matter may be confusing, but knowing the shaykhs from whom they narrated or the students to whom they narrated will help one to differentiate between them. One of the two who have identical names may not have narrated from the same shaykhs as the other. But if they had the same shaykhs and the same students, in that case the matter is more confusing, and only people of knowledge could differentiate between them.\nBecause they lacked knowledge of the levels and generations of narrators, some scholars made mistakes and thought that a narrator was someone else, or they may have regarded a narrator as belonging to the wrong level or generation.""(Sharh at-Tabsirah wa’t-Tadhkirah\xa02/342-343).\n3.. Isnads should be memorised with the wording in which each narrator received the hadith and transmitted it to his students; and whether there was a clear statement such as “I heard” or “he narrated to us” or “he told us”, or that was not stated clearly and the report simply says “it was narrated from” and so on. All of this will enable the scholar to acquire the skill to differentiate between uninterrupted and interrupted isnads.\nConclusion:\nMemorizing the names of the narrators along with the chains of narration is the methodology that was adopted by the hadith scholars of the early generations and those who came after them, and it has proven to be very useful. The wise person will make the most of his time by following the method of learning and seeking knowledge which has been tried and tested.\nBut this is only required for specialists in this field and those who aspire to attain the pinnacle of this branch of knowledge. As for ordinary people, it is sufficient for them to memorize whatever they are able to of the texts – the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) – and to study those words and understand them.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/500984/how-important-is-it-to-memorise-the-isnads-chains-of-narration-of-hadiths
227441,"I know that the Quran is one of the attributes of Allah, like His Eye, His Hand and so on, and that it is the word of Allah in a real sense, that was sent down to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) through Jibril (peace be upon him), and that the Quran is not created. But what is meant by that? Does that mean that the words of Allah are not created, even when we read them, although we are created by Allah and everything we say or do is part of the creation of Allah? Is thinking in this way regarded as a kind of overstepping the mark? I do not want to do that, all I want is to ensure that my belief is sound.","['Praise be to Allah.Is the Quran Created?\nThe Quran is the word of Allah, may He be Exalted, and is not created . What is meant by that is that Allah, may He be exalted, spoke the words of the Quran, which Jibril (peace be upon him) heard from Him, and brought down to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and conveyed it to him.\xa0\nAll of the attributes of Allah, may He be Exalted, are uncreated; they are eternal, with no beginning. The words of Allah are among these attributes, and that includes the Quran. Therefore, the scholars said that the Quran is not created, because it is the words of Allah , and that is one of His attributes.\xa0\nAre people\'s actions created?\nWith regard to people\'s actions, they are created. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“While Allah has created you and what you do [or make].”\xa0[As-Saffat 37:96]\nThere are two issues that we must distinguish between:\xa0\n\nThe first is the words of Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, that He spoke initially, and Jibril (peace be upon him) heard them from Him, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) conveyed them to us. This is an attribute of Allah that is not created in its letters and words; the same applies to His voice with which Allah spoke initially, and Jibril (peace be upon him) heard it from Him.\xa0\n\nAll of this comes under the heading of the words of Allah, nothing of which is created, no matter how it is written, recited or heard.\xa0\n\nThe second is the actions of the person, who is the vessel which carries the words of Allah, so he writes them in a book, reads them and hears them. All that comes from a person and that he does is created.\xa0\n\nSo the hand of the person is created, the ink with which he writes is created, the paper on which he writes is created, the person\'s tongue is created, his voice that belongs to him is created. All of these are vessels in which people carry the word of Allah and transmit it and convey it.\xa0\nMore than one of the leading scholars have explained this issue and differentiated between these two matters. Foremost among them is the leader of hadith scholars, Imam Muhammad ibn Isma`il Al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him). He wrote a book on this specific topic entitled Khalq Af`al Al-`Ibad. Among other things he said in it (2/70):\xa0\n“Abu `Abdullah ibn Isma`il said: I heard `Ubaydullah ibn Sa`id say: I heard Yahya ibn Sa`id say: I always heard our companions say that people`s deeds are created.\xa0\nAbu `Abdullah said: Their movements, voices, actions and writing are created. As for the Quran that is recited, recorded in the Mus-haf, written, and memorised in people\'s hearts, it is the word of Allah and is not created. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Nay, but they, the clear Ayat (i.e., the description and the qualities of Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) written like verses in the Tawrat (Torah) and the Injil (Gospel)) are preserved in the breasts of those who have been given knowledge (from the people of the Scriptures)\nBut it is clear revelations in the hearts of those who have been given knowledge.”\xa0[Al-`Ankabut 29:49]\nIs-haq ibn Ibrahim said: ""As for the vessels, who would doubt that they are created?”\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \xa0\n“When we recite the Quran, we recite it with our voices that are created, that cannot resemble the voice of the Lord. The Quran that we recite is the word of Allah, conveyed from Him and not heard directly from Him. Rather we recite it with our voices. The words are the words of the Creator, but the voice is the sound of the reciter, as is indicated by the Quran and Sunnah, as well as common sense. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And if anyone of the Mushrikun (polytheists, idolaters, pagans, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah) seeks your protection then grant him protection, so that he may hear the Word of Allah (the Quran), and then escort him to where he can be secure.”\xa0[At-Tawbah 9:6]\nAnd the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Make the Quran beautiful with your voices.”\xa0 (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 12/98) (See also: Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 12/53)\xa0\nThe scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas said:\xa0\n“What we are required to believe concerning the Quran, which is the view of Ahl As-Sunnah wal Jama`ah, as indicated by the Quran and Sunnah, is that the Quran is the word of Allah in a true sense. Its letters and meanings were sent down, not created . It came from Him and will return to Him. It is the word of Allah, may He be exalted, when it is recited and when it is written.
