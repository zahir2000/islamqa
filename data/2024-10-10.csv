What is the difference between it and the river of al-Kawthar?,"['Praise be to Allah.The cistern to which people will come (al-hawd al-mawrud) is a cistern in the land of gathering which will belong to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on the Day of Resurrection. Al-Kawthar is a river in Paradise from which two spouts will pour water into this cistern which Allah has promised to His Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), to which the believers of his ummah will come. It is a huge cistern, the length and width of which are the distance of a month’s travel. The believers will come to him, and whoever drinks one draught from it will never thirst again after that. Its vessels are as numerous as the stars of the sky, and its water comes down from Paradise, from the river of al-Kawthar. These are the details of this matter.\nThe cistern will be on earth and its water will come from Paradise. Al-Kawthar is a river in Paradise, and its water will come down into this cistern via two spouts, as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “They will pour into this cistern on the Day of Resurrection, and those who believe in Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) will come to it.”\nWhat is meant by earth here is the land of the gathering. The river exists in Paradise at present, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {Indeed, We have granted you, [O Muhammad], al-Kawthar} [al-Kawthar 108:1]. It is a mighty river in Paradise from which, on the Day of Resurrection, two spouts will lead to the earth which, on the Day of Resurrection, will be changed and the people will be standing on it.\n(End quote from Shaykh `Abd al-`Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him): Fatawa Nur `ala ad-Darb, 1/356)']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/149082/the-cistern-to-which-people-will-come-and-the-river-of-al-kawthar
103623,"Some Brothers of mine are growing their beards but they are shaving their moustaches. They are saying that Omar, may Allah be pleased with him, did this and so it is good to do it. I read some answers on your website regarding the trimming of the moustaches, but it is permissible to shave it.","['Praise be to Allah.The scholars differed concerning the recommended Sunnah regarding the moustache, and there are two views:\n\nThe first view is that it is Sunnah to shave off the moustache altogether. This is the view of the Hanafis and Hanbalis. They quoted as evidence the apparent meaning of the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that were narrated concerning this, such as “Trim the moustache” [Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 5892 and Muslim, 259] and other similar reports in Al-Bukhari and Muslim.\n\nAt-Tahawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Sharh Ma`ani Al-Athar (4/230):\nShaving the moustache is better than trimming. This is the view of Abu Hanifah, Abu Yusuf and Muhammad (may Allah have mercy on them). (End quote)\nIbn `Abidin (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated in Radd Al-Muhtar (2/550) that later scholars preferred to trim it and said:\nThe (Hanafi) view according to some later scholars among our Shaykhs is that the moustache should be trimmed. It says in Al-Bada’i`: This is the correct view. (End quote)\n\nThe second view is that the Sunnah is to trim the moustache, and that shaving it is disliked. This is the view of the Malikis and Shafi`is. Imam Malik (may Allah have mercy on him) was very strict concerning that.\n\nThey quoted the following as evidence:\n\nIt was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that he heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “The Fitrah is five things: circumcision, shaving the pubes, trimming the moustache, trimming the nails and plucking the armpit hairs.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari,\xa0 5891 and Muslim, 257)\nIt was narrated that Al-Mughirah ibn Shu`bah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “My moustache grew too long and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) trimmed it for me on a Siwak.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 188; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud)\n\nAl-Bayhaqi (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated in As-Sunan Al-Kubra (1/151) with his chain of narration that `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn `Abdullah Al-Uwaysi said: Malik ibn Anas mentioned that some people shave their moustaches, and he said: The one who does that should be beaten. The Hadith of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about the moustache does not speak of shaving, rather it should be trimmed just enough to let the edge of the lips and the mouth show.\nMalik ibn Anas (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Shaving the moustache is a Bid`ah (innovation) that has appeared among the people. (End quote)\nAbul-Walid Al-Baji (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Muntaqa Sharh Al-Muwatta` (7/266):\nIbn `Abd Al-Hakam narrated from Malik: Trimming the moustache does not mean shaving it. I think that the one who shaves his moustache should be disciplined. Ashhab ibn Malik narrated: Shaving it is a Bid`ah (innovation).\nMalik (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It was narrated from `Umar ibn Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) that when he was upset by something, he would twist his moustache. If it was shaved off, there would be nothing to twist. (End quote from At-Tamhid, 21/62-68).\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Majmu` (1/34-341):\nThe guideline on trimming the moustache is that it should be trimmed so that the edge of the lip can be seen, but it should not be shaved off completely. This is our view. End quote.\nIn Nihayat Al-Muhtaj by Ar-Ramli (8/148), who is one of the Shafi`i Imams, it says: It is disliked to shave the moustache. (End quote)\nThis opinion was also narrated from a number of the Salaf.\nAl-Bayhaqi (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated in As-Sunan Al-Kubra (1/151) with his chain of narrators that Shurahbil ibn Muslim Al-Khawlani said: I saw five of the companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) trimming their moustaches and letting their beards grow and dyeing them with saffron: Abu Umamah Al-Bahili, `Abdullah ibn Bisr, `Utbah ibn `Abd Al-Sulami, Al-Hajjaj ibn `Amir Ath-Thamali and Al-Miqdam ibn Ma`di Yakrib Al-Kindi. They used to trim their moustaches to the edge of the lip.\nThey responded to the evidence quoted in favour of the first view in two ways:\n\nWhat is meant by trimming is trimming the edge of the hair which grows over the lip, not shaving off the hair completely, based on the evidence of the reports which mention trimming only.\n\nAbul-Walid Al-Baji (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Muntaqa Sharh Al-Muwatta` (7/266):\nIbn Al-Qasim (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated from Malik that the explanation of the Hadith of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about trimming the moustache is that it is to be trimmed enough to let the red part of the lips show and the edges of the mouth. (End quote)\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Majmu` (1/340):\nThese reports – i.e. the reports which speak of trimming the moustache – are understood by us to mean trimming it to the edge of the lips, not shaving it off completely. End quote.\n\nTrimming does not mean removing it altogether, rather it means removing part of it.\n\nThe more correct view – and Allah knows best – is the second one, which is that the Sunnah is to trim the moustache and not to shave it.\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Majmu` Al-Fatawa (11/Bab Al-Siwak wa Sunan Al-Fitrah/question no. 54):\nThe best is to trim the moustache as is the Sunnah. As for shaving it, that is not Sunnah. The analogy drawn by some scholars, that it is prescribed to shave it as the head is shaved in Hajj is an analogy when a clear text states something else, so this analogy does not carry any weight. Hence Malik said concerning shaving the moustache: It is an innovation that has appeared among the people, but we should not turn away from what is mentioned in the Sunnah, because following it is guidance, righteousness, happiness and success. (End quote)\nThe Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas was asked: In a number of Hadiths it says “trim the moustache”. Is shaving different from trimming? Some people trim the first part of the moustache that is closest to the upper lip, and they leave the hair of the moustache, so they trim nearly half of the moustache and leave the rest. Is this what is meant? Or does trimming the moustache mean shaving off all of it? Please advise me of the manner in which the moustache should be trimmed.\nThey replied:\nThe authentic Hadiths from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) indicate that it is prescribed to trim the moustache. For example, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Trim the moustache and let the beard grow; be different from the Mushrikin.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim)\nAnd he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Trim the moustache and let the beard grow; be different from the Magians,” and in some versions it says: “Trim the moustache.” Trimming means cutting it very short. The one who cuts his moustache very short so that the upper lip is visible or trims it is not to blame, because the Hadiths mention two things, but it is not permissible to leave the edges of the moustache, rather the whole moustache should be trimmed or cut, in accordance with the Sunnah. (End quote from Fatawa Al-Lajnah Al-Da`imah, 5/149)\nShaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn Baz, Shaykh `Abd Al-Razzaq `Afifi, Shaykh `Abdullah ibn Qa`ud.\nAt-Tabari and Al-Qadi `Iyad favoured the view that both are permissible: shaving and trimming; Al-Hafidh Ibn Hajar also inclined towards this view in Fat-h Al-Bari (10/347).\xa0(Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah, 25/320)\nAnd Allah knows best']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/103623/is-moustache-prohibited-in-islam
260842,Is it permissible to pray behind a person who does not believe in the existence of the jinn?,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nMany verses and mutawatir hadiths indicate that Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, created the jinn, and that they are accountable and should follow the commands and prohibitions. Some of them are disbelievers and some of them are believers; they will be brought to account on the Day of Resurrection and they will go either to paradise or to hell, exactly like humans.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me}\xa0[Adh-Dhariyat 51:56]\n{O company of jinn and mankind, did there not come to you messengers from among you, relating to you My verses and warning you of the meeting of this Day of yours?” They will say, “We bear witness against ourselves”; and the worldly life had deluded them, and they will bear witness against themselves that they were disbelievers}\xa0[Al-An`am 6:130].\nThe fact that we do not see them does not mean that they do not exist, for Allah has given them the characteristic of invisibility. He, may He be glorified and exalted, says:\n{Indeed, he [Iblis] sees you, he and his tribe, from where you do not see them}\xa0[Al-A`raf 7:27].\nAllah, may He be glorified and exalted, has told us in His holy Book about the origin of the jinn, as He says:\n{And the jinn We created before from scorching fire}\xa0[Al-Hijr 15:27]\n{And He created the jinn from a smokeless flame of fire}\xa0[Ar-Rahman 55:15].\nAccording to the hadith narrated from `A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The angels were created from light, the jinn were created from fire, and Adam was created from that which has been described to you.” (Narrated by Muslim, 5314)\nAllah, may He be glorified and exalted, revealed an entire surah in His Book which speaks about the jinn.\nHence there is no one among the Muslim groups and sects who deny the existence of the jinn; in fact, even the disbelievers such as the Jews and Christians believe in their existence.\nNo one denies their existence except some doubters and heretics who base their views on speculation, assumption and imagination in all matters. Hence they do not believe in anything for certain, because all they have is possibilities and speculation. {They follow nothing but conjecture and they do nothing but lie } [Al-An`am 6:116].\nDespite that, the leaders of these heretics affirm the existence of the jinn. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said regarding them:\nAll their denial of that [i.e., belief in the jinn and so on] is only based on pure ignorance, they reject that which they do not comprehend, even before any explanation thereof reaches them.\nHowever, there are senior philosophers who believed in such things, as well as leading physicians such as Hippocrates and others. They believed in the jinn and described epilepsy as being of two types: one which has a physical cause and one which is caused by the jinn. (End quote from ar-Radd `ala al-Mantiqiyyin, p. 470)\nIbn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) also said:\nNo group of Muslims disagreed about the existence of the jinn or the fact that Allah sent Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to them. The majority of non-Muslim groups also affirm the existence of the jinn.\nWith regard to the People of the Book, the Jews and Christians, they believe in them just as the Muslims do… This is because the existence of the jinn is mentioned in reports which were narrated from all the prophets, and there are so many such texts that it leaves no room for doubt.\nWhat is known for certain is that the jinn are living, rational beings who act on the basis of free will and are, in fact, subject to commands and prohibitions. They are not mere characteristics and symptoms that exist in human beings or others, as some heretics claim…\nHence some of the Mu`tazilah, such as al-Jaba’i, Abu Bakr and others denied that the jinn could enter the body of the epileptic, but they did not deny the existence of the jinn, because the hadiths that mention jinn possession were not as clear as the hadiths which speak of their existence, even though they were mistaken about that. (End quote from Majmu` al-Fatawa, 18/10).\nAsh-Shibli (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nNo one denied the existence of the jinn apart from a small group of ignorant philosophers, physicians and the like.\nWith regard to prominent figures among the philosophers and physicians, what is narrated from them is either that they affirm the existence of the jinn, or nothing is reported from them concerning the matter.\nWhat is known from Hippocrates, is that he said regarding some spring of water: It is beneficial for treating epilepsy; I do not mean the epilepsy that is treated by the priests of the temples [meaning jinn possession, which was treated with spiritual remedies]; rather I mean the epilepsy that is treated by the physicians.\nAnd he said: If we compare our [that is, physicians’] medicine with the medicine of the priests, their medicine is like the medicine of old women compared to our medicine!\nThose who deny the existence of the jinn have no reliable proof that is indicative of their nonexistence. All they have is lack of knowledge, because in their profession there is nothing to indicate that the jinn exist. (End quote from Akam al-Marjan, 22).\nSee also the answers to questions no. 2340 and 20666.\nSecondly:\nThe existence of the jinn is proven physically in real life in such a way that cannot be denied. Stories about them are widespread and are known to all people. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has told us about them in His Book, and He has told us about them and about their origin and from what they were created, and how their father Iblis disbelieved in Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, refused to obey Him and was arrogant. Then He has told us about how Iblis tempted the father of humanity, Adam (peace be upon him), and how He sent them both down to earth, and made the devils a trial for people.\nAnd He, may He be glorified, has told us that some of them are believers and some of them are disbelievers, and some of them were subjugated and served Allah’s Prophet Sulayman (peace be upon him).\nAnd He, may He be glorified, has told us that some of them believed in the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and some of them disbelieved in him.\nAnd He, may He be glorified, has told us that the disbelievers among them are given power over the sons of Adam to tempt them, and they whisper to them in order to bar them from the religion of Allah… and there are many other reports about them in the Quran and Sunnah.\nSo the one who disbelieves the Quran and rejects what Allah, may He be exalted, has stated in His Book about the creation and existence of the jinn, if he is accountable (that is, an adult of sound mind) and knows what he is saying, has gone beyond the bounds of Islam and has disbelieved because of this belief of his. No prayer offered by someone like him is accepted, and neither is his fasting, and no Jumu`ah or prayer in congregation can be prayed behind him, or any prayer, obligatory or supererogatory, until he comes back to Islam, because denying something that is well known from the teachings of Islam constitutes disbelief.\nShaykh Salih al-Fawzan (may Allah preserve him) said:\nDenying the existence of the jinn constitutes disbelief and apostasy from Islam, because it is denying something that is mentioned in many places in the Quran and many texts of the Sunnah that reach the level of being mutawatir. Believing in their existence is part of believing in the unseen, because we cannot see them, and in order to prove their existence we rely on sound religious texts. Allah, may He be exalted, says regarding Iblis and his troops:\n{Indeed, he [Iblis] sees you, he and his tribe, from where you do not see them}\xa0[Al-A`raf 7:27].\nAs for denying that they can enter the body of a human being [jinn possession], that does not lead to being deemed to be a disbeliever, but it is wrong and is a rejection of what is proven in the religious texts and by real life experience. But because the issue is so subtle, the one who has a different view cannot be deemed to be a disbeliever. However, he is mistaken, because he did not rely on any evidence to deny that; rather he based it on his rational thinking and ability to understand. But reason is not reliable when it comes to matters of the unseen and it cannot be given precedence over the religious texts, except in the view of misguided people.\nShaykh ‘Abdullah al-Ghunayman (may Allah preserve him) said:\nSome people nowadays deny the existence of the jinn, but denying the existence of the jinn constitutes disbelief and puts a person beyond the bounds of Islam, because it is a matter that is mentioned in many texts of the Book of Allah and in reports from the messengers. (End quote from Sharh Fat-h al-Majid)\nIt is unlikely for a Muslim to be unaware of this, or to believe in something different, because it is something that is very well known and is mentioned in many texts of the Quran and Sunnah.\nIf we assume that this person or someone else denies such a thing, or is unaware of it, it should be explained to him and proof should be established so as to leave him with no excuse and so that his doubts may be dispelled. Then if he persists in denying the existence of the jinn after clear proof has been presented to him, then he is a disbeliever and an apostate from the religion of Islam.\nShaykh Salih Al ash-Shaykh (may Allah preserve him) said:\nBelieving in the jinn is obligatory; that includes believing in their existence and what Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has told us about their characteristics in His Book, and what has been soundly narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) about them.\nSo whoever denies the existence of the jinn is a disbeliever, because he has rejected the Quran. Therefore – if such a person is unaware – he should be informed of what it says in the verses of the Quran. Then if he denies the existence of the jinn, even though they are mentioned in the Quran, his denial would lead to rejecting the Quran, and thus he becomes a disbeliever. (End quote from Sharh at-Tahawiyyah, 323)\nFor the one who finds out that someone denies the existence of the jinn, it is not permissible for him to pray behind him, unless he recounts his misguidance and repents to Allah, may He be glorified and exalted.\nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 153492.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/260842/the-ruling-on-one-who-denies-the-existence-of-the-jinn-and-the-ruling-on-praying-behind-him
14231,I am happy to have found this website of yours. I was born a Muslim and I learned a lot of Islamic teachings after I reached adolescence. I am trying to understand my religion.,"['Praise be to Allah.The Primacy of Quran and Sunnah in Islamic Rulings\nThe Muslim should not incline more towards one scholarly opinion rather than another just because it is in accordance with his whims and desires or his reasoning. Rather he has to accept the ruling based on evidence from the Quran and Sunnah. It is essential to put the texts and rulings of Shari`ah before all else.\nWhat is apostasy?\nApostasy (Riddah) and going out of Islam are things that may be done in the heart, on the tongue or in one’s actions.\nForms of apostasy\nApostasy may take place in the heart, such as disbelieving in Allah, or believing that there is another creator alongside Allah, or hating Allah or His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).\nApostasy may take the form of words spoken on the tongue, such as defaming Allah or the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).\nOr apostasy may take the form of outward physical actions, such as prostrating to an idol, mistreating the Mus-haf, or not praying.\nThe apostate (Murtadd) is worse than one who is a disbeliever in the first place.\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said, refuting the pantheistic belief of the Batinis:\nIt is well known that the disbelieving Tatars are better than these (Batinis), because the latter are apostates from Islam, of the worst type of apostates. The apostate is worse than one who is a disbeliever in the first place in many aspects.\xa0(End quote from Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 1/193)\nCircumstances That Excuse a Muslim from Being Declared a Disbeliever\nNot every Muslim who falls into disbelief is a disbeliever and apostate. There are reasons why a Muslim may be excused and not judged to be a disbeliever, for example: ignorance, misunderstanding, being forced, and making mistakes.\n\nWith regard to the first, a man may be ignorant of the ruling of Allah, because he lives far from the Muslim lands, such as one who grows up in the desert or in a disbeliever land, or has only recently come to Islam. This may include many of those Muslims who live in societies where ignorance prevails and knowledge is scarce. These are the ones concerning whom the questioner is confused as to whether they are to be judged as disbelievers and executed.\nThe second reason is if a person interprets the ruling of Allah in a manner not intended by the Lawgiver, such as those who blindly follow the people of Bid`ah (innovation) in their misinterpretations, such as the Murji’ah, Mu`tazilah, Khawarij and the like.\nThe third reason is if an oppressor overwhelms a Muslim and will not let him go until he makes a blatant statement of disbelief out loud in order to ward off the torture, when his heart is at ease with faith.\nThe fourth is when words of disbelief come to one’s lips without meaning it.\n\nNot everyone who is ignorant about Wudu and prayer can be excused, when he sees the Muslims establishing prayer and praying regularly, and he can read and hear the verses on prayer. What is preventing him from praying or from asking about how it is done and what its essential conditions are?\nPunishment for Apostasy in Islam\nThe apostate is not to be put to death immediately after he falls into apostasy, especially if his apostasy happens because of some doubt that arose. Rather he should be asked to repent and he should be offered the opportunity to return to Islam and resolve his doubts, if he has any doubts. Then if he persists in his apostasy after that, he is to be put to death.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Mughni (9/18):\nThe apostate should not be put to death until he has been asked to repent three times. This is the view of the majority of scholars, including `Umar, `Ali, `Ata’, An-Nakh`i, Malik, Ath-Thawri, Al-Awza`i, Is-haq and others. Because apostasy comes about because of doubt, and cannot be dispelled in an instant. Time should be allowed for the person to rethink the matter, and the best length of time is three days.End quote.\nThe authentic Sunnah indicates that it is essential to put the apostate to death.\nAl-Bukhari (6922) narrated that Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever changes his religion, put him to death.”\nAl-Bukhari (6484) and Muslim (1676) narrated that `Abdullah ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “It is not permissible to shed the blood of a Muslim who bears witness that there is no god except Allah and that I am the Messenger of Allah, except in one of three cases: a soul for a soul (i.e., in the case of murder); a previously-married person who commits adultery; and one who leaves his religion and separates from the main body of the Muslims.”\nThe general meaning of these Hadiths indicates that it is essential to put the apostate to death whether he is waging war on Islam (Muharib) or not.\nThe view that the apostate who is to be put to death is the one who is waging war on Islam (Muharib) only is contrary to these Hadith. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said that the reason why he should be put to death is his apostasy, not his waging war against Islam.\nVerbal vs. Physical War Against Islam: Which Is More Harmful?\nUndoubtedly, some kinds of apostasy are more abhorrent than others, and the apostasy of one who wages war against Islam is more abhorrent than that of anyone else. Hence some of the scholars differentiated between them, and said that it is not essential to ask the Muharib to repent or to accept his repentance; rather he should be put to death even if he repents, whereas the repentance of one who is not a Muharib should be accepted and he should not be put to death.\nThis is the view favoured by Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him).\nHe said:\nApostasy is of two types: ordinary apostasy and extreme apostasy, for which execution is prescribed. In both cases there is evidence that it is essential to execute the apostate, but the evidence indicating that the sentence of death may be waived if the person repents does not apply to both types of apostasy. Rather the evidence indicates that that is allowed only in the first case – i.e., ordinary apostasy – as will be clear to anyone who studies the evidence that speaks about accepting the repentance of the apostate. In the second type – i.e., extreme apostasy – the obligation to put the apostate to death still stands, and there is no text or scholarly consensus to indicate that the death sentence may be waived. The two cases are quite different and there is no comparison between them. It does not say in the Quran or Sunnah, or according to scholarly consensus, that everyone who apostatizes in word or deed may be spared the death sentence if he repents after he is captured and tried. Rather the Quran and Sunnah, and scholarly consensus, differentiate between the different kinds of apostates.\xa0(End quote from As-Sarim Al-Maslul, 3/696)\nAl-Hallaj was one of the most well-known heretics who were put to death without being asked to repent. Al-Qadi `Iyad (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe Maliki jurists of Baghdad at the time of Al-Muqtadir unanimously agreed that Al-Hallaj should be killed and crucified because of his claim to divinity and his belief in incarnation, and his saying “I am Al-Haqq [God],” even though he outwardly appeared to adhere to Shari`ah, and they did not accept his repentance. (End quote from Ash-Shifa bi Ta`rif Huquq Al-Mustafa, 2/1091)\nBased on this, it is clear that what the questioner says about the apostate not being killed unless he is waging war on Islam is mistaken, and the differentiation that we have quoted from Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) may dispel any confusion and make the matter clearer.\nWaging war against Islam is not limited only to fighting with weapons, rather it may be done verbally such as defaming Islam or the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), or attacking the Quran, and so on. Waging verbal war against Islam may be worse than waging war against it with weapons in some cases.\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nMuharabah (waging war against Islam) is of two types: physical and verbal. Waging war verbally against Islam may be worse than waging war physically – as stated above – hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to kill those who waged war against Islam verbally, whilst letting off some of those who waged war against Islam physically. This ruling is to be applied more strictly after the death of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Mischief may be caused by physical action or by words, but the damage caused by words is many times greater than that caused by physical action; and the goodness achieved by words in reforming may be many times greater than that achieved by physical action. It is proven that waging war against Allah and His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) verbally is worse and the efforts on earth to undermine religion by verbal means is more effective.\xa0(End quote from As-Sarim Al-Maslul, 3/735)\nThe Ruling on Not Praying: Is It Apostasy?\nWith regard to not praying, the correct view is that the one who does not pray is a disbeliever and an apostate. See question no.\xa05208.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/14231/punishment-for-apostasy-in-islam
