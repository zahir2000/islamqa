228612,"How can we raise the level of taqwa (fear of Allah, righteousness) in our hearts? I waste time watching television and playing games; what can I do?","[""Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nAllah, may He be glorified and exalted, has commanded us to fear Him (taqwa), and He has told us that taqwa is the key to success and prosperity in this world and the hereafter, as He, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{O you who have believed, fear Allah as He should be feared and do not die except as Muslims [in submission to Him]}\xa0[Al ‘Imran 3:102]\n{And whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger and fears Allah and is conscious of Him - it is those who are the attainers}\xa0[an-Nur 24:52].\nAnd He tells us that He, may He be glorified, is with those who fear Him:\n{Indeed, Allah is with those who fear Him and those who are doers of good}\xa0[an-Nahl 16:128]\n{but Allah is the protector of the righteous}\xa0[al-Jathiyah 45:19].\nAnd He tells us that the [best] outcome is for the righteous (those who fear Allah), as He says:\n{And the [best] outcome is for the righteous}\xa0[al-A‘raf 7:128].\nThey are those who will attain salvation and success in this world and the hereafter, as He says:\n{And We saved those who believed and used to fear Allah}\xa0[Fussilat 41:18].\nAnd He says:\n{Then We will save those who feared Allah}\xa0[Maryam 19:72]\n{Indeed, for the righteous is attainment}\xa0[an-Naba’ 78:31].\nThe righteous (those who fear Allah) among the believers are the allies or close friends of Allah:\n{Unquestionably, [for] the allies of Allah there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve,\nThose who believed and were fearing Allah}\xa0[Yunus 10:62-63].\nAnd there are many similar verses.\nSecondly:\nTaqwa (fearing Allah and being righteous) means doing what Allah has enjoined and refraining from what He has prohibited.\nOne of the things which will help a person to do that is reflecting on the matter of this world and the hereafter, and understanding the value of each of them. This understanding will inevitably prompt a person to strive to attain the bliss of paradise in the hereafter and salvation from the fire. Hence Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, tells us about paradise that it is {prepared for the righteous} [Al ‘Imran 3:133].\nOne of the things that will increase taqwa in people’s hearts is striving to obey Allah, may He be exalted, and do righteous deeds, because Allah will reward him for that with an increase in guidance and taqwa, which will help him to adhere to what Allah has enjoined and will open to him the gates of goodness and obedience, and Allah will make easy for him that which was not easy for him before. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And those who are guided - He increases them in guidance and gives them their righteousness}\xa0[Muhammad 47:17].\nOne of the means which help a person to increase his fear of Allah and attain taqwa is fasting a great deal, for Allah, may He be exalted, has ordained in fasting a special quality that helps a person to do acts of worship and obedience, and endears such acts to him. Hence Allah, may He be exalted, said regarding the obligation of fasting:\n{O you who have believed, decreed upon you is fasting as it was decreed upon those before you that you may become righteous}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:183].\nHence the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) enjoined it, emphasized it and told us that there is nothing like it in that regard. It was narrated that Abu Umamah said: I said: O Messenger of Allah, tell me of a good deed. He said: “You should fast, for there is nothing like it.” I said: O Messenger of Allah, tell me of [another] good deed. He said: “You should fast, for there is nothing like it.”\nNarrated by Ahmad (22149), an-Nasa’i (4/165) and others; classed as sahih by al-Albani.\nAnother thing that will help to strengthen taqwa in the heart is: striving to acquire the characteristics of the righteous who fear Allah, which Allah, may He be exalted, has mentioned in His book, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Righteousness is not that you turn your faces toward the east or the west, but [true] righteousness is [in] one who believes in Allah , the Last Day, the angels, the Book, and the prophets and gives wealth, in spite of love for it, to relatives, orphans, the needy, the traveler, those who ask [for help], and for freeing slaves; [and who] establishes prayer and gives zakah; [those who] fulfill their promise when they promise; and [those who] are patient in poverty and hardship and during battle. Those are the ones who have been true, and it is those who are the righteous}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:177]\n{And hasten to forgiveness from your Lord and a garden as wide as the heavens and earth, prepared for the righteous\nWho spend [in the cause of Allah] during ease and hardship and who restrain anger and who pardon the people - and Allah loves the doers of good -\nAnd those who, when they commit an immorality or wrong themselves [by transgression], remember Allah and seek forgiveness for their sins - and who can forgive sins except Allah? - and [who] do not persist in what they have done while they know.\nThose - their reward is forgiveness from their Lord and gardens beneath which rivers flow [in Paradise], wherein they will abide eternally; and excellent is the reward of the [righteous] workers}\xa0[Al ‘Imran 3:133-136].\nAnother thing that helps is adhering to the guidance and teachings of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and keeping away from innovations that have been introduced into the religion. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And, [moreover], this is My path, which is straight, so follow it; and do not follow [other] ways, for you will be separated from His way. This has He instructed you that you may become righteous}\xa0[al-An‘am 6:153].\nAnother thing that helps is keeping away from the things that Allah has prohibited, as He, may He be exalted, says:\n{These are the limits [set by] Allah, so do not approach them. Thus does Allah make clear His ordinances to the people that they may become righteous}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:187].\nAnother thing that helps is reflecting on the verses of Allah and His signs in the universe as He, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Indeed, in the alternation of the night and the day and [in] what Allah has created in the heavens and the earth are signs for a people who fear Allah}\xa0[Yunus 10:6]\n{And thus We have sent it down as an Arabic Qur'an and have diversified therein the warnings that perhaps they will avoid [sin] or it would cause them remembrance}\xa0[Ta-Ha 20:113].\nOther things that also help to strengthen taqwa in the heart include:\n\nRemembering Allah a great deal and reciting Qur’an.\nKeeping company with good people who offer sincere advice and reminders, and avoiding evil people and followers of innovation.\nReading biographies of those who feared Allah among the righteous believers, such as the scholars, the ascetics and devoted worshippers.\n\nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 14041 .\nSecondly:\nThe wise person should be prepared to meet Allah, may He be exalted, at any moment, for he does not know when death will come to him, after which he will not be able to make up for his shortcomings, and at that time he will feel regret at a time when regret will be to no avail.\nEach person will be questioned on the Day of Resurrection “about his life and how he spent it, and about his youth and how he used it.” Narrated by at-Tirmidhi (2416); classed as sahih by al-Albani.\nGood health and free time are among the blessings of Allah, may He be exalted, the value of which many people do not appreciate until after they lose them. Hence the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There are two blessings which many people fail to benefit from: good health and free time.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (6412).\nWhat is meant by “failing to benefit from them” is using his health and his free time in that which will not benefit him in this world or in the hereafter. This is true loss.\nThe wise person understands that he is going to be faced with a momentous matter, so it is essential that he prepares for it.\nAny effort made in obeying Allah in this world will lead to comfort and ease in the hereafter. Hence one of the early generations would push himself to strive hard in obeying Allah; the people advised him to rest, if only for a little while, and he said: “It is rest that I seek.” End quote from al-Fawa’id (p. 42).\nAny comfort and pleasure that results from disobeying Allah in this world will lead to regret and punishment, if Allah does not forgive the doer on the Day of Resurrection.\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/228612/how-can-we-strengthen-fear-of-allah-taqwa-in-our-hearts
145198,"In the hadith it says that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever hears a man making a lost property announcement in the mosque, let him say: May Allah not restore it to you, for the mosques were not built for this purpose.” In the light of this hadith, if someone loses something valuable in the mosque and does not announce it – rather he tells the imam or the caretaker – do they come under the prohibition that is mentioned in the hadith? Does the prohibition that is mentioned in the hadith apply only to one who loses something, or is it general in meaning, applying to making any kind of announcement in the mosque?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt is not permissible to make lost property announcements in the mosques or to make announcements about items that have been found, because the mosques were not built for that; rather the mosques were built for the remembrance of Allah. Muslim (568) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever hears a man making a lost property announcement in the mosque, let him say: ‘May Allah not restore it to you, for the mosques were not built for this purpose.’”\nMuslim (569) also narrated from Buraydah (may Allah be pleased with him) that a man made a lost property announcement in the mosque, saying: Has anyone found the red camel? The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “May you not find it. The mosques were only built for that for which they were built.”\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), “May you not find it,” and his instruction to say such words are a punishment to [the one who makes such announcements] for going against his teachings and disobeying him. The one who hears him [making such an announcement] should say: “May you not find it, for the mosques were not built for this.” Or he may say: “May you not find it; the mosques were only built for that for which they were built” – as the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said. End quote.\nIbn ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAllah, may He be exalted, has stated that the mosques are houses which Allah has ordered to be raised and that His name be mentioned therein; exalting Him within them in the morning and the evening [an-Nur 24:36]. It is for this purpose that they were built, so they should be protected from everything for which they were not built.""(Al-Istidhkar\xa02/368).\nAl-Bayhaqi narrated in as-Sunan (20763) that ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) built a public courtyard next to the mosque and called it al-Butayha’. He used to say: Whoever wants to make noise or recite poetry or raise his voice, let him go out to this public courtyard.\nSee: al-Istidhkar (2/368).\nSo whoever wants to make a lost property announcement, let him go outside the mosque, and if he writes on a piece of paper and sticks it on the outside wall of the mosque, there is nothing wrong with that.\nWhoever loses something in the mosque, and wants to tell the imam of the mosque or the mu’adhdhin or the caretaker, so that they can tell the one who finds it who it belongs to, and the like, there is nothing wrong with that, if he speaks to him privately.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe mosques were not built for the making of lost property announcements or buying and selling; rather they were built for the worship of Allah, for prayer, dhikr, circles of knowledge and the like.\nAs for writing announcements on pieces of paper and posting them in the mosque, if that is on the outside wall, there is nothing wrong with it, or if it is on an outer door, there is nothing wrong with it. As for posting them inside, that is not appropriate, because it is akin to speaking, and because it may distract people who look at the notice and read it.\nWhat appears to be the case to us is that it is not permissible, because posting notices in the mosque is the same as making lost property announcements. But if it is written on the outside wall, or it is written on the door and is outside the mosque, there is nothing wrong with that.""(Fatawa Nur ‘ala ad-Darb\xa0 2/709).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAs Allah has stated that the mosques are His houses, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) described them in the same way, and they are houses which Allah has ordered to be raised, they have sanctity, there are rulings which apply to them, and they should be respected.\nOne of the rulings regarding mosques is that it is not permissible to buy and sell in them, whether on a small scale or a large scale. Similarly, it is not permissible to make lost property announcements in them, when a man comes and says: I have lost such and such, such as a wallet. This is haram and is not permissible even if you think it likely that it was stolen in the mosque; you should not say, How can I get it back? Go and sit at the door of the mosque, outside the mosque, and say: May Allah reward you, I have lost such and such.\nThe point is that the mosques must be respected.(Sharh Riyadh as-Salihin\xa0 p. 2014).\nThe scholars of the Permanent Committee said:\nHe can post a notice outside the door of the mosque, in a specific spot, so that people can read it.""(Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah\xa0 5/275).\nSecondly:\nThe prohibition is general in meaning and applies to all announcements made in the mosque, except announcements having to do with acts of worship – there is nothing wrong with that.\nThe scholars of the Permanent Committee said:\nIt is not permissible to take the mosques, or any of their facilities, or the external courtyards and precincts that belong to them, as places to set up noticeboards, advertisements and other commercial signage, whether that is for schools, factories, companies or otherwise. That is because the mosques have only been built for the worship of Allah, may He be exalted, through prayer, dhikr, learning and teaching Islamic knowledge, reciting Qur’an and other religious matters.\nSo they should be protected from the things mentioned, and their sanctity should be preserved. We should be keen not to distract people with things that will divert them from worshipping Allah, may He be exalted, and focusing on the hereafter.""(Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah\xa05/276-277).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\nAn announcement was made in one of the mosques that iftar would be provided for everyone who wanted to fast every Thursday. What is the ruling on that?\nHe replied: There is nothing wrong with this announcement, because it is an announcement which calls people to something good, and the purpose behind it is not buying or selling. What is prohibited is making announcements about buying and selling, or renting and hiring, which are things for which the mosques were not built. As for calling people to something good, feeding people and giving charity, there is nothing wrong with that. End quote.\nSee the answer to question no. 3468 .\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) was also asked: What is the ruling on posting some advertisement in the mosque, such as an advertisement about a trip for Hajj or ‘umrah, or advertisements about lectures and lessons?\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) replied: If the advertisement has to do with an act of worship, there is nothing wrong with it, because acts of worship are things that draw people closer to Allah, and the mosques were built for the worship of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted.\nBut if the advertisement has to do with worldly matters, then it is not prohibited. Rather it may be advertised via posters on the outside wall of the mosque. Hajj group trips are a worldly matter, so we do not think that they should be advertised inside the mosque.\nCircles of dhikr – such as courses and classes on Islamic knowledge – are pure good, so there is nothing wrong with announcing them inside the mosque, because they are something good.""(Sharh Manzumah al-Qawa‘id al-Fiqhiyyah\xa0 p. 52).\nAnd Allah knows best.\nSee also the answer\xa0to question\xa0no.\xa0138263 .']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/145198/it-is-not-permissible-to-make-lost-property-announcements-or-post-notices-about-lost-property-in-the-mosque
