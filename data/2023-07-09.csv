283715,"I hope that you can save me from the punishment and wrath of Allah. I am a Muslim who had an Islamic upbringing and was raised with good morals and manners, and I am still viewed like that by others, but unfortunately I often give in to temptation and go to indecent websites and look at immoral images and videos on my phone, where people cannot see me. I know that Allah sees me, but every time I commit this immoral deed I do not only watch, but I also commit the secret habit. I am married and have children. I know that what I am doing is an animalistic action, when only Allah, may He be exalted can see me. I know that this action erases good deeds and even obliterates them. I pray and repent, and I remain patient for a day or two, then I go back to it again. I feel a strong and strange urge to open the phone and look at pictures and videos, and to commit that evil deed. I do not know what I should do. I know that if I die, I will go to hell, but I cannot control myself. Help me and save me, may Allah have mercy on you.","['Praise be to Allah.We understand what you are suffering of anguish because of what you are committing of sin and doing that repeatedly. This anguish is a good sign, as it indicates that even though you are sick in one way, in another way you are still healthy and there is still some good in you. The ultimate remedy for this problem can only be closing all the doors that lead you to disobey Allah; close every door that leads you to despair of the mercy of Allah. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Say, “O My servants who have transgressed against themselves [by sinning], do not despair of the mercy of Allah. Indeed, Allah forgives all sins. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful”}\xa0[az-Zumar 39:53]\n{ And those who do not invoke with Allah another deity or kill the soul which Allah has forbidden [to be killed], except by right, and do not commit unlawful sexual intercourse. And whoever should do that will meet a penalty.\nMultiplied for him is the punishment on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein humiliated,\nExcept for those who repent, believe and do righteous work. For them Allah will replace their evil deeds with good. And ever is Allah Forgiving and Merciful.\nAnd he who repents and does righteousness does indeed turn to Allah with [accepted] repentance}\xa0[al-Furqan 25:68-71].\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Jawab al-Kafi (p. 165):\nThe wisdom of Allah, may He be exalted, which is based on justice and grace has dictated that the one who repents from sin is like one who never sinned.\nAllah, may He be glorified, has guaranteed the one who repents from shirk, murder and zina that He will turn his bad deeds into good deeds. This is a general ruling which applies to everyone who repents from sin.\nAnd Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Say, “O My servants who have transgressed against themselves [by sinning], do not despair of the mercy of Allah. Indeed, Allah forgives all sins. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful”}\xa0[az-Zumar 39:53].\nNo sin is excluded from the general meaning of the verse, but it is particularly true in the case of those who repent. End quote.\nAllah, may He be exalted, has described the muttaqin (the pious, those who are mindful of Allah and fearHim) in His Book as being those who, if they commit major sins, or wrong themselves by committing minor sins, they remember the Almighty, the Oft-Forgiving, so they seek forgiveness for their sins and do not continue to do them or persist in sin.\nAllah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And hasten to forgiveness from your Lord and a garden as wide as the heavens and earth, prepared for the righteous,\nWho spend [in the cause of Allah] during ease and hardship and who restrain anger and who pardon the people - and Allah loves the doers of good,\nAnd those who, when they commit an immorality or wrong themselves [by transgression], remember Allah and seek forgiveness for their sins - and who can forgive sins except Allah? - and [who] do not persist in what they have done while they know.\nThose - their reward is forgiveness from their Lord and gardens beneath which rivers flow [in Paradise], wherein they will abide eternally; and excellent is the reward of the [righteous] workers}\xa0[Al ‘Imran 3:133-136].\nThe one who persists in sin is the one who commits it, then commits sin again, time after time, without repenting or seeking forgiveness.\nAs for the one who commits a sin, then repents soundly and sincerely from it, then weakens and goes back to sin again, then repents sincerely from it, and so on, is alternating between sin and disobedience, on the one hand, and repentance, regret and turning to the Most Merciful, the Most Gracious, on the other hand. There is the possibility that he will be pardoned by Allah, if Allah wills, and there is the hope that Allah will help him to overcome his problem and forgive him his sins.\nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “A man committed a sin and said: ‘My Lord, forgive me.’\nHis Lord said: ‘Did My slave know that he has a Lord Who forgives sin, and calls people to account for sin? I have forgiven My slave.’\nThen as much time as Allah willed passed, then he sinned again and said: ‘My Lord, I have sinned again; forgive me.’\n[Allah] said: ‘Did My slave know that he has a Lord Who forgives sin, and calls people to account for sin? I have forgiven My slave.’\nThen as much time as Allah willed passed, then he sinned again and said: ‘My Lord, I have sinned again; forgive me.’\n[Allah] said: ‘Did My slave know that he has a Lord Who forgives sin, and calls people to account for sin? I have forgiven My slave three times. Let him do what he wills.’”\nNarrated by al-Bukhari (7507 and Muslim (2758).\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Sharh Sahih Muslim (17/75):\nIf the sin is repeated a hundred times, or a thousand times or more, and he repents every time, his repentance will be accepted and his sins will be erased.\nIf he repents from all his sins in one go, after having committed them all, his repentance is valid.\nWhat is meant by the words of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, to the one who sinned repeatedly – “Do what you will, for I have forgiven you” – mean: so long as you sin, then repent, I will forgive you. End quote.\nSo continue to repent after every sin, and be sincere in your repentance, regretting and feeling sorry for what you have committed of sin in the past, and resolving to give it up forever.\nThen strive to perfect your repentance by doing the following:\nBlock all means that prompt you to commit this sin. This means not being alone; always be with other people, or with your wife and children.\nIf you must be away from your wife, try to bring her with you, and do not stay alone far away from your wife. Maintain your chastity with her, and help her to maintain her chastity.\nIf you are close to your wife and family, and are staying with them, then do not stay away from them. Endear yourself to your wife, and meet your needs with her. Every time you feel aroused as a result of looking at something, or as a result of an accidental glance, do not let the Shaytan prompt you to fulfil your desire in haram ways; rather hasten to do it in a halal way.\nConstantly keep yourself busy with beneficial actions, whether they have to do with this world or the hereafter, because idleness corrupts the individual in a big way.\nCompletely disconnect your phone from the Internet. It may be more beneficial for you to change your phone, and use a phone that has no access to the Internet.\nStrengthen your faith and your fear of Allah and His strict reckoning. Constantly bear in mind that He can see you and is watching you.\nRead Qur’an a great deal and offer a lot of supererogatory (nafil) prayers, especially voluntary prayers at night (qiyam al-layl).\nOffer a great deal of supplication for guidance, and one of the most beneficial supplications for guidance that a person can say is {Ihdina as-sirat al-mustaqim (Guide us to the straight path)}.\nFor more information on means that will help you to give up watching indecent films, please see the answer to question no. 210259 .\nWe ask Allah to guide us and you, and make us and you steadfast.\nAnd Allah is the One Who enables us to do that which He loves is pleased with.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/283715/he-commits-prohibited-acts-in-private-and-wants-advice
273858,"A man did the Islamic marriage contract, without doing the official civil contract. Shortly after doing the marriage contract, some troubles occurred, so the man decided to divorce her for some reason. What are the Islamic rulings that result from this divorce? Please note that he did not specify the dowry, and they were alone together, but the marriage was not consummated (intercourse).","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIf the marriage contract was done by the woman’s guardian or his proxy, in the presence of two witnesses, then it is a valid marriage, regardless of whether it was officially documented or not. Specifying the dowry is not a condition of the marriage contract, so if he married her without mentioning or specifying the dowry, the marriage is valid and the woman is entitled to a dowry like that of her peers.\nIbn Qudamah said in al-Mughni (7/182): The marriage is valid without specifying the dowry, according to the view of most scholars. That is indicated by the words of Allah, may He be exalted (interpretation of the meaning):\n{There is no blame upon you if you divorce women you have not touched nor specified for them an obligation [i.e., the dowry] }\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:236].\nIt was narrated from Ibn Mas‘ud that he was asked about a man who married a woman, and did not specify a dowry for her or consummate the marriage with her before he died. He said: She is entitled to a dowry like that of her peers, no more and no less; she must observe ‘iddah; and she is entitled to inheritance. Ma‘qil ibn Sinaan al-Ashja‘i stood up and said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) issued a ruling concerning Barwa‘ bint Waashiq, one of our womenfolk, similar to the ruling that you have issued.\xa0 Narrated by Abu Dawud and at-Tirmidhi, who said: it is a sahih hasan hadith. End quote.\nSecondly:\nIf the woman was divorced before consummation of the marriage and before being alone with her, if he had specified a dowry for her, then she is entitled to half of it, and if he did not specify any dowry for her, she is entitled to compensation, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{There is no blame upon you if you divorce women you have not touched nor specified for them an obligation [i.e., the dowry]. But give them [a gift of] compensation - the wealthy according to his capability and the poor according to his capability - a provision according to what is acceptable, a duty upon the doers of good.\nAnd if you divorce them before you have touched them and you have already specified for them an obligation, then [give] half of what you specified - unless they forego the right or the one in whose hand is the marriage contract foregoes it. And to forego it is nearer to righteousness. And do not forget graciousness between you. Indeed Allah, of whatever you do, is Seeing}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:236, 237].\nThere is no stipulated amount for this compensation according to Islamic teachings; rather it depends on how well off or otherwise the man is. If they agree on a certain amount, then the purpose has been served. If they disagree, then it is the judge who should determine the amount.\nShaykh Muhammad al-Amin ash-Shinqiti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIn fact, there is no amount for that compensation that is stipulated according to Islamic law, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning) {the wealthy according to his capability and the poor according to his capability} [al-Baqarah 2:236].\nSo if they agree on a certain amount, the matter is clear. If they differ, then the judge should work out what is most appropriate, and he should determine the amount in the light of the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning) {the wealthy according to his capability …} [al-Baqarah 2:236]. This is what appears to be the case.\nThe apparent meaning of the words {[a gift of] compensation} [al-Baqarah 2:236] and {And for divorced women is a provision} [al-Baqarah 2:241] indicates that it is obligatory to give this compensation or provision in general terms. This is in contrast to the view of Malik and those who agreed with him; he said that it is not obligatory to give this compensation or provision at all.""(Adwa’ al-Bayan\xa0 1/192).\nThirdly:\nIf the divorce takes place before consummation of the marriage, but when the couple have been completely alone together in such a way that it was possible to consummate the marriage with her, then the majority of Hanafi and Maliki scholars – and ash-Shafa‘i in his old view – and the Hanbalis are of the view that she must observe ‘iddah, then she is entitled to the dowry in full.\nThis was narrated from a number of the senior Sahabah, such as ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab, ‘Ali, Zayd ibn Thabit, Mu‘adh ibn Jabal and ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with them).\n‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) consulted a number of the Companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and none of them differed concerning the fact that the dowry is obligatory in that case.\nThere are conditions attached to this being alone together, which have been explained previously in the answer to question no. 268304 . One of these conditions is that she should have been willing and that she would not have prevented him from having intercourse if he had wanted to.\nIf this being alone together did indeed occur, then this woman must be given a dowry like that of her peers, in full. If it did not occur, then she is not entitled to anything except compensation.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/273858/he-divorced-her-before-consummating-the-marriage-and-after-being-alone-with-her-and-he-did-not-specify-any-dowry-for-her
130071,"Is it permissible to use contraceptives because of my low income, which does not cover our needs and living costs, in addition to the fact that I am in poor health and suffer from exhaustion and fatigue? Please note that I am afraid that that will be compounded if we have many children.","['Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to use contraceptives for fear of low income, because Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, is the Provider. This is akin to the actions of the people of Jahiliyyah who killed their children for fear of poverty. Rather you should think positively of Allah and put your trust in Him, may He be glorified and exalted.\nAllah is the Provider, the Almighty, may He be glorified and exalted, and it is He, may He be glorified and exalted, Who says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{There is no creature that lives on the earth but its sustenance is guaranteed by Allah}\xa0[Hud 11:6].\nSo what is required is for both husband and wife to think positively of Allah and not use contraceptives.\nBut if the contraceptive is used for a different reason, such as if the mother is sick or if there is\xa0 the risk of harm to her health or her uterus, or there is fear of harm to both of them; or because they already have a lot of children, and without contraception there will be one pregnancy after another, without a break, so she wants to use contraception for a short period, such as a year or two, so that it will not be too difficult to raise the children and so that she will not become unable to do that – then there is nothing wrong with that, as it is in the best interests of the children, and it is not due to thinking negatively of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. The same applies if having another pregnancy could harm her and she is unable to cope. But if the matter has to do with provision (rizq), then the Provider is Allah; regardless of whether you are sick or healthy, it is Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, Who provides for you and in His hand is the control of all things. So you must think positively of Allah and put your trust in Allah, for Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, is the Provider, Lord of Might, the Powerful.
