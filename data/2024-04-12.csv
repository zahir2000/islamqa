500479,"I know that the two khuthbahs are a condition of the jummah. But the masjid I go to sometimes they do two sometimes one. I know of only one masjid that’s very far from me that does two all the time. The rest of them Allahualim I don’t know what they do. I supposed I could explore around. The question is, if I walk into the masjid and they give only one khuthba what should I do? Leave and pray dhur? I will I be sinful for coming to that masjid when I know sometimes they only give one?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nJurists have agreed that the Friday sermon is mandatory, and that the Jumu`ah prayer is not valid without it.\nIbn `Abd Al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said: ""There is a scholarly consensus that if the Imam does not deliver a sermon to the people, they do not pray except four [Rak`ahs]."" End quote from ""Al-Istidhkar"" (2/31).\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: ""The sermon is a condition for the validity of the Jumu`ah prayer; it is not valid without it. This was also said by `Ata\', Al-Nakha`i, Qatadah, Ath-Thawri, Ash-Shafi`i, Ishaq, Abu Thawr, and the people of reason. We do not know of any dissenting opinion, except that of Al-Hasan."" End quote from ""Al-Mughni"" (3/170).\nSecondly:\nThe majority of scholars opine that the two sermons are necessary for the Jumu`ah prayer, and that the prayer is not valid without them.\nIt is established from the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) that he used to deliver two sermons on Friday, sitting between them, and after him, the Rightly Guided Caliphs did the same. This guidance has been transmitted by the Ummah in both words and actions.\nJabir ibn Samurah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: ""The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) used to deliver a sermon standing, then he would sit, then stand and deliver a sermon standing."" Reported by Muslim (862).\nAnd Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: ""The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) used to deliver a sermon standing, then he would sit, then stand, just as you do now."" Reported by Al-Bukhari (920) and Muslim (861).\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: ""Two sermons are required for Jumu`ah, because the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) used to deliver two sermons, as we have narrated in the Hadith of Ibn `Umar and Jabir ibn Samurah, and he said: (Pray as you have seen me praying).\nBecause the two sermons were established in place of two Rak`ahs, so each sermon is in place of a Rak`ah, thus neglecting one of them is like neglecting one of the Rak`ahs."" End quote from ""Al-Mughni"" by Ibn Qudamah (3/173).\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: ""The Jumu`ah prayer is not valid without two sermons. Al-Qadi said: The majority of scholars stipulate two sermons for the validity of the Jumu`ah prayer."" End quote. Sharh An-Nawawi `ala Muslim (6/150).\nTherefore, if there is a mosque in your place of residence that delivers two sermons for the Jumu`ah prayer, as prescribed by the Sunnah and required by most scholars: you must pray with them. Do not pray in a mosque that performs the Jumu`ah prayer with only one sermon, even if that is done only occasionally, for you cannot be sure that they will pray with only one sermon at the time of your attendance. Rather, you must take precautions for your worship, and attend the Jumu`ah prayer, which is one of the greatest rituals of Islam, with those who establish it in the manner prescribed by the Sunnah, so that your Jumu`ah prayer is valid according to the majority of scholars. Do not risk your worship by praying with those whose prayer, according to the scholars, is not valid as Jumu`ah, making it necessary to repeat it as Dhuhr, if they cannot establish the Jumu`ah in the prescribed manner.\nFor more benefit, please see the answer to question no. (89676 )\nHis Eminence Sheikh `Abdul `Aziz Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: ""It happened that the Imam on Friday delivered only one sermon, and he was a man who led the prayer on behalf of the Imam due to the Imam\'s absence, and he was elderly, and after finishing his first sermon he told the people: Stand up for the prayer. So the people stood up and prayed, then afterwards many people disagreed, whether the prayer was valid or not? And we want your Eminence to enlighten us.""\nHe replied: ""The prayer is not valid, and he must return and deliver the second sermon, then repeat the prayer. Two sermons are required, as the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) did, and they are a condition for the validity of the prayer, this is the most correct opinion. Therefore, this man must repeat the prayer and his companions must repeat it with him, and in the future, two sermons must precede the prayer."" End quote, from ""Fatawa Nur `Ala Ad-Darb by Ibn Baz with care of Al-Shuwa`ir"" (13/222).\nHe was also asked: ""A person who delivers only one sermon for Jumu`ah, has he violated the Sunnah by doing that?""\nHe replied: ""Yes, two sermons are required. Two sermons are a condition for the validity of the Jumu`ah prayer, as the Prophet used to do (peace and blessings be upon him). If he delivers only one sermon, the Jumu`ah prayer is not valid, but he must deliver the second sermon and repeat the Jumu`ah prayer."" End quote, from ""Fatawa Nur `Ala Ad-Darb by Ibn Baz with care of Al-Shuwa`ir"" (13/295).\nHis Eminence Sheikh Muhammad ibn Salih Al-`Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: ""Is the Jumu`ah prayer valid with only one sermon?""\nHe replied: ""Two sermons are necessary for the Jumu`ah prayer; because the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) used to deliver two sermons for Jumu`ah. And he says (peace and blessings be upon him) in the Jumu`ah sermon: (As for what follows, the best speech is the Book of Allah and the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him)).\nIf he limits himself to only one sermon, he would be contrary to the guidance of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him); therefore, their Jumu`ah is not valid.\nThe Jumu`ah prayer must have two sermons. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) used to deliver two sermons and separate them with a sitting; so it is not sufficient for him to separate them with silence, rather he must sit; and sitting between the two sermons is from the guidance of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him), and it is a confirmed Sunnah, and the separation between the two sermons is not achieved except by sitting."" End quote, from Fatawa Nur `Ala Ad-Darb for Al-`Uthaymin"" (8/2 with automatic numbering by Al-Shamilah).\nSheikh Ibn `Uthaymin was also asked: ""It happened that the preacher forgot and delivered only one sermon to the people, then led them in prayer, and the question, Your Eminence, is: Is this Jumu`ah valid or not? And is it obligatory to repeat it for the Imam and the followers, or just the Imam, and then pray it as Dhuhr? May Allah guide you and make your steps firm and reward you with the best reward on behalf of Islam and the Muslims.""\nHe replied: ""It is obligatory for the Imam and the followers to repeat it as Dhuhr. 24/3/1416H."" End quote, from the collection of Fatawa and Letters of Al-`Uthaymin (16/79).\nThirdly:\nIf you go to a mosque, and you did not know that they perform the Jumu`ah prayer with only one sermon, and you find it so; you should not leave the prayer with the Muslim congregation for that reason. Rather, you must pray with them following the Imam, and do not differ with him.\nIf after that you can catch the Jumu`ah in another mosque in your neighborhood, or close to you, before they finish the prayer; then go to them and pray Jumu`ah with them.\nAnd if you cannot do that; it appears that there is no harm on you if you are satisfied with your prayer with the first Imam, even if he prayed with one sermon. The stipulation of two sermons is not a matter of consensus among scholars, but there is a considerable difference of opinion; although the preponderant opinion is what we have presented from the requirement of two sermons, and upon it are the fatwas of our scholars from the people of knowledge; but that does not negate the considerable difference of opinion on the issue.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: ""Malik, Al-Awza`i, Ishaq, Abu Thawr, Ibn Al-Mundhir, and the people of reason said: One sermon is sufficient for him. And it has been narrated from Ahmad what indicates this."" End quote from ""Al-Mughni"" by Ibn Qudamah (3/173).\nAnd if you were cautious, and the matter was so, and you repeated your prayer as Dhuhr, it would be better.\nAnd if there is no one in your place of residence who performs the Jumu`ah prayer with two sermons, or there is, but its location is far from you, and you think it most likely that you will not reach it except after missing the Jumu`ah with them, then pray with those who perform the Jumu`ah, even with one sermon.\nAnd strive to advise this Imam to establish the prayer with the people as prescribed by the Sunnah, and not to risk their worship, and not to expose them to hardship and difficulty. If there are among the people of the place those who do not see the prayer with one sermon, then what necessitates him to do that; let him pray with two sermons, so his prayer and Jumu`ah will be valid, and the Jumu`ah of those with him, by the agreement of the people, and the hearts will be united upon him, and he will not put those with him in difficulty.\nSheikh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: ""The Friday preacher in my country delivers only one sermon and does not sit in the usual sitting of the preachers before him, is this considered contrary to the Sunnah?""\nHe replied: ""Yes, this is contrary to the Sunnah without a doubt; for it is established from the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) that he used to deliver two sermons on the day of Jumu`ah, separating them with a sitting. In fact, most scholars say: The Jumu`ah prayer is not valid; because one of the conditions for the validity of the Jumu`ah prayer is that it be preceded by two sermons.\nTherefore, inform this Imam that his action is contrary to the Sunnah, and that his action, according to many scholars, means that his Jumu`ah is not valid, and tell him to fear Allah Almighty, and to follow the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) in his guidance, for the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him). We ask Allah for guidance for us and for him."" End quote, from the website of the Sheikh.\nIf he does not respond to you, or the congregation of the mosque overpowers him in that; then pray with them, and it does not appear that you are obliged to repeat it as Dhuhr, for you have done what you could, and the Jumu`ah is only with the people, and this is the Jumu`ah that you are able to attend. And in matters of considerable difference of opinion among scholars, it is prescribed for the follower to pray behind an Imam who differs from his madhhab, even if he does what is considered invalid according to the follower, or omits what is obligatory or a condition according to the follower.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n""As for those who differ in subsidiary matters, such as the followers of Abu Hanifah, Malik, and Ash-Shafi`i: the prayer behind them is valid and not disliked, as Ahmad explicitly stated; because the Companions, the Successors, and those after them: used to follow each other in prayer, despite their differences in subsidiary matters, so that was a consensus."" End quote, from ""Al-Mughni"" (2/11).\nSheikh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: ""About the followers of the four madhhabs: Is the prayer of some of them valid behind others? ... And if the Imam does what he believes is valid and the follower believes otherwise. Is it permissible? And is the prayer valid behind him? Or not?\nHe replied: Yes, it is permissible for some of them to pray behind others, as the Companions, the Successors, and those after them from the four Imams used to pray behind each other, despite their dispute in these mentioned issues and others.\nAnd no one from the predecessors said that some of them do not pray behind others, and whoever denies that is an innovator, misguided, contradicting the Book, the Sunnah, and the consensus of the predecessors of the Ummah and its Imams.\nAnd the Companions, the Successors, and those after them: some of them used to recite the Basmalah and some of them did not, and some of them used to recite it aloud and some of them did not, and some of them used to perform Qunut in Fajr and some of them did not, and some of them used to perform Wudu’ from cupping, nosebleeds, and vomiting, and some of them did not....""

1397,"Will Allah accept the prayer and good deeds of a person who is continually committing sin such as fortification even though in his/her heart the person is aware that he/she is sinning and is full of guilt and tries his/her very best not to continue committing such sin. Except for this weakness this person tries to be a good muslim e.g. never misses daily prayers, giving out time and money towards the cause of Allah, never taking alcohol or other un-halal foods etc.","['Praise be to Allah.Praise be to Allah.\nWill Allah accept your good deeds if you commit Zina?\nAllah will accept whatever righteous deeds from one who commits Zina , such as praying, fasting, giving charity etc., and He will also accept his repentance , as He says (interpretation of the meaning): “And He it is Who accepts repentance from His slaves, and forgives sins, and He knows what you do.” [Ash-Shu`ra’ 42:25]\nBut there is the condition that his repentance must be sincere . Does this person truly regret what he has done? Is he indeed determined not to repeat the sin? Has he, I wonder, gotten rid of everything that may lead him to sin, such as relationships, addresses, telephone numbers, going to evil places, bad friends, movies, pictures and so on? What we believe is that if this person truly repents, he will give up this sin.\nZina is one of the worst kinds of immoral deeds. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And come not near to the unlawful sexual intercourse. Verily, it is a Fahishah [i.e., anything that transgresses its limits, a great sin], and an evil way (that leads one to Hell unless Allah forgives him).” [Al-Isra’ 17:32]\nPunishment for Zina\xa0\nMarried people who commit Zina (adultery) are to be punished with the worst and most severe form of punishment , which is to be stoned to death, so that every part of their bodies may feel pain just as they felt pleasure in a prohibited manner even though they were not without a halal source of pleasure (i.e., within marriage).\xa0\nUnmarried people who commit Zina, and had never been married before, are to be given the maximum number of lashes prescribed in Shari`ah, which is one hundred lashes. In addition, they are subjected to the humiliation of having their punishment witnessed by a group of believers, and are to be banished for one full year from their city, the place where they committed the crime.\nPunishment for Zina in Al-Barzakh\nThe punishment for those who are guilty of Zina in Al-Barzakh (i.e., after death and before the Day of Resurrection) is that they will be in an oven, the top of which is narrow and the bottom of which is wide. A fire will be lit under it, and they will be naked in (that oven). When the fire is lit, they will scream and rise up until they almost come out of the oven, then when the fire subsides, they will go back down into it. This is what will keep happening to them until the Hour begins. So how will their punishment be in the Fire of Hell itself?\nWe ask Allah not to despise us and to accept our repentance; we ask Him to help us to do good and to avoid evil, for He is the All-Hearing, Ever-Near.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1397/will-allah-accept-good-deeds-if-one-commits-zina
480155,I invested in a hospital project which is currently in the preliminary stage of construction. I don't expect any profit in the next 5 to 8 years. Do i have to pay zakat on the investment?,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nInvesting in the construction of a hospital means that the building is to be kept and is not for sale, and profit will be generated after the hospital is up and running from what doctors charge for examining patients, selling medicines, doing x-rays and lab tests, and so on, if the hospital is going to provide these services.\nIf that is the case, there is no zakah on the building or devices and equipment, or anything that is bought to be kept and used in the hospital. It says in al-Ma‘ayir ash-Shar‘iyyah regarding zakah:\n1/4 Fixtures and fittings for the purpose of running the business\nFixtures and fittings for the purpose of running a business are not subject to zakah, such as offices of institutions and the equipment in them, and what the company possesses of intangible things, if they are not for the purpose of trading, such as things that the institute makes use of, such as patents, trademarks and software, and movable items that are kept in the building for the purpose of operating the business and are not prepared for sale, such as machine parts, machines and equipment (in industrial settings), even if they are in storage, so long as they are not for sale.\n2/4 Other fixtures that are used to generate income\nThere is no zakah on other fixtures that are used to generate income, such as things that are rented out, so long as they are not for sale. Rather zakah is due on what is left of the income generated by means of them at the end of the zakah year, by adding that accumulated income to other zakatable wealth and paying zakah on the total.""(Al-Ma‘ayir ash-Shar‘iyyah, p. 448).\nSecondly:\nIn this case, zakah is due on three things:\n1. Cash that is used to build the hospital, if one full hijri year has passed and some of it is left. In that case the one who is in charge of the project must give zakah on it. If he does not do that, then each shareholder must estimate his share of that money, and give zakah on it.\n2. What is prepared for sale, such as medicines. Its value should be worked out at the end of the zakah year, and the zakah on trade goods must be given on it. So one quarter of one tenth (2.5%) must be given.\nThe zakah year begins from the time of taking possession of the money with which the medicines and the like, that are to be sold, were purchased, if this money reached the nisab (minimum threshold at which zakah becomes due).\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Mughni (2/504): If someone buys goods to sell with money that reached the minimum threshold, or he sells goods of which the value reached the nisab, the zakah year is not interrupted (rather it continues), because zakah is due on the value of the goods, not on the goods themselves, and their value is their price. Hence the price and the goods come under the same category. End quote.\n3. With regard to income that is generated after the hospital is up and running, such as doctors’ fees and the like, the accounts should be examined at the end of the zakah year, and zakah should be paid at a rate of one quarter of one tenth (2.5%) on the money that is available and debts which are expected to be paid and are not owed by someone who is in financial difficulty or is delaying payment for no reason.\nIn this case, the zakah year begins from when this money was acquired, after the hospital is up and running.\nThirdly:\nIt is permissible for the people in charge of the project to take care of paying zakah, but if they do not do that, each shareholder should pay zakah himself, after finding out his share of the money that is subject to zakah as we have mentioned above.\nIt says in al-Ma‘ayir ash-Shar‘iyyah, p. 88: With regard to investments in shares with the aim of keeping the shares for the purpose of their yields: if it is possible to find out from the company what belongs to each share of wealth that is subject to zakah (cash, trade goods and debts which are expected to be paid), he should give zakah on that.\nIf that is not possible, he should give zakah on whatever zakatable wealth is connected to each share on the basis of estimation. If the company does not have any zakatable wealth, he should give zakah on what remains of the net income at the end of the zakah year.

6084,"The following article was published stating that the prophet’s spirit is omnipresent at all times (may allah bless him & give him peace). below is most of their article and their proofs. is what they say the truth? 
it is the contention and the belief of the ahle sunnat wal jamat that the holy prophet(sallal lahu alaihi wasallam) is : (a). present & seeing at all times , (b). aware and witnessing the creation of allah , (c). able to be present in several places at the same time . 
"" 'o' nabi (communicator of the unseen) we have sent you as a witness."" (s33 v45). 2). ""then how shall it be, when we bring up a witness from each nation (of each prophet) and 'o' beloved messenger we will bring you as a witness and guardian against all those."" (s4 v41)
observe that the holy prophet(sallal lahu alaihi wasallam) is being called a witness to all the nations that allah has put upon this earth. therefore, the holy prophet(sallal lahu alaihi wasallam) must have been present before his earthly appearance and is still present after this earthly demise, otherwise he cannot be called upon as a witness in the true sense of the word. there are many other verses of the holy quran that call upon the holy prophet(sallal lahu alaihi wasallam) to be a witness. and a witness can only be someone who is hazir & nazir.
a technical point: the following quranic verses are often quoted to show that the holy prophet(sallal lahu alaihi wasallam) was not present and seeing before his earthly appearance : ""and you('o' prophet) were not with them(present) when they cast their pens(to decide) which of them should be mary's guardian."" (s3 v44)
