430984,"He got an employment offer from an online bank that helps freelancers, small scale businesses have a bank account. They do not give any loans as such but do partner with other lending companies if their users want loans. But they themselves do not deal in Loans with interest. Is it permissible to work as a Manager in such kind of a company?","['Praise be to Allah.If the bank helps anyone who wants to take out a loan from companies which lend with interest, then working in the bank is haram, because it is helping with something that is haram. Allah, may He be exalted, says:\n{And cooperate in righteousness and piety, but do not cooperate in sin and transgression. And fear Allah; indeed, Allah is severe in penalty}\xa0[Al-Ma’idah 5:2].\nMuslim (1598) narrated that Jabir ibn ‘Abdillah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) cursed the one who consumes riba and the one who pays it, the one who writes it down and the two who witness it, and he said: they are all the same.\nAl-Qadi ‘Iyad said: The scribe and the witness are included here, because they help in this sin and participate in it.""(Ikmal al-Mu‘allim\xa0 5/283).\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This clearly indicates that it is haram to write down the contact between the two who deal in riba, and to act as a witness to that transaction. It also indicates that it is haram to help in falsehood.

242079,"Praise be to Allah, I am a religiously committed young man living in a European country. My father does not pray, and he gambles, meaning that he bets on horses. One day he won a prize from betting, and he told me that he was going to buy me a car and a house with this money. But I told him that all that I want is for him to be safe. Now I do not know what to do; should I accept it from him or not?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nWe ask Allah, may He be exalted, to make you steadfast in adhering to righteousness, and to guide your father, and to grant you the joy of seeing him mend his ways, and to enable you to honour and obey him.\nUndoubtedly your father is in grave danger and is being tested with a great trial. The right that the one who is tested has over us is that we should show kindness to him and be compassionate regarding his situation and pity him, and we should be gentle in calling him, in order to bring him out of the situation he is in. The first thing you should do in calling and guiding him is pay attention to the matter of prayer, even if you do that gradually and gently. Perhaps Allah will guide him and open his heart to establishing prayer and obeying the Lord of the Worlds.\nSecondly:\nUndoubtedly the most prudent and appropriate thing for you to do is refuse to accept this money, because the money itself that you would be accepting was acquired in an unlawful manner. As there is a strong difference of opinion among the scholars as to whether it is permissible to accept such a gift, then being cautious and not accepting such a gift is more appropriate, and that will be of greater help to you in explaining to your father the ruling on it and the prohibition on acquiring it. Perhaps Allah will guide him because of what he sees of his son’s restraint and refusal to benefit from it.\nHowever, if you need that money and it is too difficult for you to do without it, or if not accepting it would result in estrangement between you and your father, or it would result in a bad relationship between you, then we hope that there will be no blame on you for accepting it from him, even if he did acquire it in an unlawful manner, because in the case of wealth that is haram because of the manner in which it was acquired – such as wealth acquired by dealing in riba, gambling or accepting bribes – it is permissible for someone other than the one who acquired it, if he obtains it in a permissible manner, such as a gift or what is spent on his maintenance. This has been stated by more than one of the scholars, and we have given answers on that basis on this website.\nFor more information, please see the answers to questions no. 171922 , 126486 , 215 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/242079/should-he-accept-the-money-from-his-father-even-though-he-obtained-it-by-gambling
