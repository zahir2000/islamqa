240235,"Is it obligatory for my husband to give me pocket money, some of which I can save, because he does not want me to work outside the house? As I have no way to help my widowed mother, because I have no income myself.","['Praise be to Allah.The husband is not obliged to spend on his wife’s mother; rather he is obliged to spend on his wife and his household members on a reasonable basis.\nBut he should be generous to his wife’s family, and help them if they are in need, even if that comes under the heading of his charitable giving or zakah.\nThis is emphasised even more in this case, if his wife’s mother has no one to spend on her, as mentioned in the question.\nIf the wife knows that her husband would willingly give some things, such as food and similar things that people are usually easy-going about, there is nothing wrong with her giving such things to her mother, in a way that will not affect her own household costs, even if she does not clearly ask her husband for permission, so long as she thinks it most likely that he will overlook such things and will not prevent her from doing it. In that case, she will have reward and so will he.\nIt was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If a woman gives food [in charity] from her house, without causing any harm, she will have her own reward for what she gives, and her husband will have his own reward for what he earned, and the storekeeper will have a similar reward, without any of them detracting from the reward of the others in the slightest.” Agreed upon.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/240235/is-the-husband-obliged-to-spend-on-his-wifes-mother
174648,"I've been married for 4 years and we have two children. We have a nice marriage with no fighting and Islam comes first.
But I feel that everything comes from my side, I teach my children everything, also Islam, my husband is always working, may Allah bless him for taking care of us.
But now for 3 years he doesn't want to be intimate with me; only 2 times maybe and then I was pregnant.
Because of my 2 pregnancies, I gained weight and that's why he said and he cheated on me , I forgave him, and we had after that a much better marriage but without intimacy. I always have to help him with oral sex but I also really need intimacy. I already lost a lot of weight, I always make myself beautiful for him, I know I'm beautiful. I do everything for Allah and for him and for my children, he says there is no better or beautiful wife than me, but he doesn't touch me, I tried everything. He says that it is not me but he is tired from his job. My feelings started to become less, he had a long beard, now it is so short. I always talk about Islam with him, he says that he is so proud of me. But he hurt me so many times through our marriage, we also still don't live together and it's killing me. It 's such a long story, khayr in sha Allah.
I want love and intimacy, I want to feel beautiful and loved and ...He is a good man, like he is sweet and calm and gives me everything I need, but the most important thing I don't have with him.
What must I do, and do you have any advice for him?
If I have to give you more information, I will do that.","[""Praise be to Allah.Wife’s right to intimacy\nThere is no doubt that what you mention is very difficult for a young woman. A woman may be able to do without her husband spending on her or providing her with accommodation, clothing or other material needs. She may be able to do without all of that, by spending from her own wealth or her family’s wealth or whatever… But she has no way to maintain her chastity and fulfil her physical desire except her husband, or by means that Allah has forbidden – Allah forbid that she should think of that or be tested in that way.\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about a man who stayed away from his wife for a month or two months and did not have intercourse with her; was there any sin on him or not? Could the husband be asked to do that? \xa0\nHe replied:\xa0\n“The husband is obliged to have intercourse with his wife on a reasonable basis, which is one of the most important rights that she has over him; it is more important than feeding her. It was said that what is obligatory with regard to intercourse is once every four months, or according to her need and his ability, just as he should feed her according to her need and his ability. And the latter is the more correct opinion.” (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 32/271)\xa0\nMuslim narrated (1006) from Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “…the intimacy of one of you (with his wife) is a charity.” They said: O Messenger of Allah, if one of us fulfils his desire, will he be rewarded for that? He said: “Do you not see that if he did it in a haram manner, there would be a burden of sin on him for that? Similarly, if he does it in a halal manner, he will be rewarded for it.”\xa0\nIn that case, what the wise husband must do is take care of his wife in that regard and give it priority over everything else, so that he may keep her chaste, conceal her and meet her needs as much as he can, even if he does not have an urgent need for that and even if he had to do it only for her, for the sake of meeting his wife’s needs. In that there will be reward for both of them, in sha Allah, and a means of help so that they attain spiritual and worldly wellbeing.\nAddressing long periods of Abstinence\nThere is no doubt that what you mentioned about your husband’s situation and that having gone on for a long time without him satisfying your needs but doing his duty towards you, is\xa0\nIf the matter is as you say, that you have not fallen short in your duties towards your husband of adorning yourself for him, endearing yourself to him and being prepared to meet your husband’s needs, then we think that you, along with your husband, should look at two things:\xa0\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Make sure that there is no medical problem that is preventing your husband from doing that, whether it is a psychological problem, as often happens, or a physical problem. We think that the possibility of this is not very strong, because of what you mentioned about your husband doing that with you, even if it is not frequent, and even his falling into that which is haram, even though he is married to you!\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Make sure that you close all avenues to your husband fulfilling his desire, except with his wife. It is natural that if your husband has got used to other ways that are prohibited, such as masturbation, or immoral relationships – Allah forbid – or ways that are permissible, such as fulfilling his desire with his wife without having intercourse, then it is natural that this will weaken his desire to have intercourse with his wife. If he has got used to these ways, perhaps what that means is that he is able to do without his wife altogether, no matter how beautiful she is or what she does for him.\xa0\nIn that case, we advise you to give up all ways that may lead to that. What you mention about oral sex is one of the causes of the problem and is not a solution to it. So fulfil your husband’s needs in all permissible ways and adorn yourself for him, and ensure that fulfilling desires is done by means of some shared action that will fulfil the rights of both parties and allow each to fulfil the duties that Allah has enjoined towards the other.\xa0\nThat also involves making sure that your husband does not repeat the prohibited action that he admitted to you and that he has repented from that action. Try to keep him away from that as much as possible, even if that is by changing the environment and the place where you live, if you are able to do that.\xa0\nRight to divorce if husband does not fulfil wife’s right to intimacy\nIf you do that and make the effort, but your husband does not change, and he continues to fail to fulfil your rights and keep you chaste by means of that which Allah has permitted, there is no doubt that the suffering in that case is something that carries weight in Shari`ah. So if you cannot put up with your husband anymore and you fear that you may fall into prohibited relations or think of it, then you can ask for separation from your husband. Perhaps if he sees that the matter is serious, he will mend his ways, and if he goes ahead and divorces you, perhaps Allah will replace him with someone who is better than him and grant you someone who will keep you chaste. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“But if they separate (by divorce), Allah will provide abundance for everyone of them from His Bounty. And Allah is Ever All-Sufficient for His creatures' needs, All-Wise.” [An-Nisa 4:130]\nBut as you know, this should be the last resort.\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Causing harm to the wife by not having intercourse is grounds for annulment in all cases, whether the husband did that intentionally or otherwise, and whether he was able to do it or not; it is like maintenance, and even more important.” (Al-Fatawa Al-Kubra, 5/481-482)\xa0\nWe ask Allah to set things straight between you and your husband, and to endear him to you and you to him, and to reconcile between you.\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 193320 , 826 , 2487 , 166912 , 2300 , 10680 , 43166 , and 23390 .\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/174648/my-husband-doesnt-satisfy-me-sexually-what-should-i-do-in-islam
505030,"I want to ask about the situation of a worker (the cashier who works in a shop). Prices of goods are written on a price list for customers. For example, the price for a carton of milk is written as 7.68 dirhams, but when the customer goes to the cashier to pay, he registers it as 8 dirhams, because he has been instructed by the management of the shop that anything above 0.60 is to be counted as one dirham. … Everyone knows this rule, because the company has many branches… What I want to say is that many people who are good at maths, meaning that they are not illiterate, know that 0.97 or 0.87 or 0.60 will be rounded up to one dirham, and that 0.50 or less will be rounded up to half a  dirham. We may add that it is not possible to give that fraction back to the purchaser in change, because it is not available at all, meaning that it is not  possible to give him one dirham and 0.44 of a dirham.… Finally I would like to ask you: is it permissible to work as a cashier, based on the details given above?","['Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible for the store to take any of the customer’s money except with his knowledge and consent, even if it is a small amount, such as the change asked about here.\nIf the price of the item is 9.90 dirhams, it is not permissible to count it as ten except with the consent of the customer, because Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {O you who have believed, do not consume one another\'s wealth unjustly\xa0but only [in lawful] business by mutual consent} [an-Nisa’ 4:29].\nAnd the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “It is not permissible to take a person’s wealth except with his willing consent.” Narrated by Ahmad (20172); classed as authentic by al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami‘ (7662).\nAnd he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Your blood, your wealth and your honour are sacred to you, as sacred as this day of yours, in this month of yours, in this land of yours. Let those who are present convey it to those who are absent.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (67) and Muslim (16779).\nAnd he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The whole of a Muslim is sacred to another Muslim, his blood, his wealth and his honour.” Narrated by Muslim (2564).\nThese texts indicate that the wealth of a Muslim is sacred, and it makes no difference whether his wealth is great or small.\nMuslim (137) narrated from Abu Umamah that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever swears an oath in order to unlawfully take the property of another Muslim, Allah will decree Hell for him and forbid Paradise to him.” A man said: Even if it is something small, O Messenger of Allah? He said: “Even if it is a twig from an arak tree.”\nIbn Hazm (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is not permissible to take anyone’s wealth unless it is based on a religious text or certain scholarly consensus. It is not permissible for anyone to stipulate a financial penalty that was not stipulated in the Qur’an or by the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Anyone who does that is transgressing the limits set by Allah, is regarding haram wealth as lawful and is prescribing something for which Allah, may He be exalted, has not given permission.""(Al-Muhalla\xa0 6/186).\nIf the customer is owed change, but the shop does not have that precise amount, he may be given some candy or the like instead, or the shop may offer to give it on his behalf in charity, and a box should be made available for that.\nConclusion:\nIt is obligatory to inform the customer of the amount of change that is due to him. If the customer agrees [to round it up], there is nothing wrong with that, otherwise it is haram to take it.\nIf the cashier is able to take this obligatory action, it is permissible for him to work in that job, otherwise it is prohibited, because of what his work involves of participating in consuming people’s wealth unlawfully.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/505030/what-is-the-ruling-on-stores-rounding-up-pennies-and-taking-them-without-the-customers-knowledge
227312,Is it permissible to say “good luck” or “bad luck”?,"['Praise be to Allah.Is saying good luck prohibited?\n\xa0“Luck” (Hadh) means a share of goodness (or good fortune). Al-Azhari (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAl-Layth said: “Luck” means a share of blessings or goodness. (Tahdhib Al-Lughah, 3/273)\nIbn Faris (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Luck” means a share of good fortune… One who has a share of provision may be described as lucky.” (Majmal Al-Lughah, p. 215)\nThis is the basic meaning: luck refers to a share of good fortune. The word may also be used to refer to fortune in general, whether it is good or bad. This is how it is used by most people.\nAl-Fayruzabadi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Luck” refers to one’s share or fortune; or it may be used specifically to refer to one’s share of good fortune.” (Al-Qamus Al-Muhit, p. 695)\nAl-Munawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Luck” is one’s decreed share.” (At-Tawqif, p. 142)\nBased on that, when people say “good luck” and the like, as a kind of supplication for the person to whom it is said, and wishing him well, there is nothing wrong with that, as is obvious; in fact it is praiseworthy because it is a kind of supplication for good and wishing the Muslims well.\nBut one should not wish or pray for bad luck for a Muslim, because this involves transgression and enmity towards one’s brother in faith.\nMuslim narrated (2735) from Abu Hurayrah, from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that he said: “A person will still be answered so long as his supplication does not involve sin or severing ties of kinship, and so long as he does not become impatient.” It was said: O Messenger of Allah, what does being impatient mean? He said: “Saying, I offered supplication, and I offered supplication, and I did not receive any response, then he becomes frustrated and stops offering supplication.”\nAl-Bukhari (13) and Muslim (45) narrated from Anas ibn Malik that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “No one of you truly believes until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself.”\nCan you say `good luck’ by way of telling something that happened?\nIf the one who says “good luck” is saying it by way of telling something that happened, so if something good happens to him he says that it was good luck, and if something bad happens to him, he says that it was bad luck, in this case too there does not seem to be anything wrong with it, in sha Allah.\nIn the case of something good happening, then the matter is clear, and it comes under the heading of speaking of the blessings of Allah and thanking Him for what He decreed for him.\xa0\nIn the case of something bad happening, then what appears to be the case is that there is also nothing wrong with it, if he is telling of something that actually happened as it appears to be, to the best of the person’s knowledge. It is well-known that things may happen to a person in his life that upset him, and this is bad luck, according to what people customarily think and say; in fact it is something that is also said in the shar`i texts. Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Say (O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)): I possess no power of benefit or hurt to myself except as Allah wills. If I had the knowledge of the Ghayb (unseen), I should have secured for myself an abundance of wealth, and no evil should have touched me”\xa0[Al-A`raf 7:188]\n“Is not He (better than your gods) Who responds to the distressed one, when he calls Him, and Who removes the evil, and makes you inheritors of the earth, generations after generations. Is there any Ilah (god) with Allah? Little is that you remember!”\xa0[An-Naml 27:62].\nThis is also what is meant by Hasanah (good, good fortune) and Sayyi’ah (evil, bad fortune), which is referred to in verses such as the following (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And if some good reaches them, they say, `This is from Allah,’ but if some evil befalls them, they say, `This is from you (O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)).’ Say: `All things are from Allah,’ so what is wrong with these people that they fail to understand any word?”\xa0[An-Nisa’ 4:78]\n“And We tried them with good (blessings) and evil (calamities) in order that they might turn (to Allah’s Obedience).”\xa0[Al-A`raf 7:168]\nAnd there are many similar, well known verses.\nBut in that case it is stipulated that there should be nothing in his words that reflects discontent with what Allah has willed and decreed for him, or thinking negatively of Allah, or attributing the evil or bad fortune to Him, may He be glorified. Bad things, evil and harm are a reality in Allah’s creation and are something that He has decreed will reach His slave according to what is decreed for that person. As for Allah’s will and decree concerning His slaves, it is all good and nothing evil or bad can be attributed to Him, for Allah is exalted and far above all faults and shortcomings.\nCan you say ‘good luck’ or ‘bad luck’ thinking that some such thing has happened outside the decree of Allah?\nSome people may say “good luck” or “bad luck”, thinking that some such thing has happened outside of the decree of Allah, may He be exalted, or because he thinks that it is connected to some things that have nothing to do with events that happen, such as attributing that to the stars, or some numbers, or some days of the week, and the like.\nSo if someone says that some person’s good luck or bad luck is due to such a reason, then what he says is wrong and is prohibited, because coincidence with such things, or otherwise, is not something that Allah has made to be the cause of good or evil.\nSomething similar was indicated in a Fatwa of the Standing Committee, when they were asked:\nWe often hear that a person has good luck or bad luck (or he is lucky or unlucky). To what extent is it permissible – or not – to believe in luck?\nThey replied:\n“We are required to believe in the will and decree of Allah, so we should be patient in bearing misfortune and we should give thanks to Allah and praise Him for good fortune. We should believe that Allah has divided provision among His slaves, and has decreed that their life spans and deeds should vary, when they were still foetuses in their mothers’ wombs. Allah is most wise in all that He wills and decrees, and every Muslim must attribute what befalls people of blessings and abundant provision to Allah, may He be glorified, Who bestows that and enables people to attain it; and he should attribute anything else that befalls him to the will and decree of Allah. This comes under the heading of attaining sound belief in Tawhid Ar-Rububiyyah (Oneness of divine Lordship). The Muslim must keep away from anything that may undermine his belief and Tawhid, so he should not attribute good and blessings, or calamities and disasters, to luck or stars, for that is not permissible. And Allah is the source of strength. May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.” (Standing Committee for Academic Research and Issuing Fatwas, Shaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn `Abdullah Al Ash-Shaykh, Shaykh `Abdullah ibn Ghadyan, Shaykh Salih Al-Fawzan, Shaykh Bakr Abu Zayd- Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 26/328)\nThinking positively of Allah\xa0\nThe Muslim should always think positively of Allah, may He be Exalted, concerning whatever befalls him in all his affairs. He may think that he has bad luck in something that may be entirely good for him. So it is better to avoid the phrase “bad luck” in all circumstances. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“and it may be that you dislike a thing which is good for you and that you like a thing which is bad for you. Allah knows but you do not know.”\xa0[Al-Baqarah 2:216]\nMuslim narrated (2999) that Suhayb (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “How wonderful is the situation of the believer, for all his affairs are good. If something good happens to him, he gives thanks for it and that is good for him; if something bad happens to him, he bears it with patience, and that is good for him.”\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 27192 , 33844 , 46985 , 33842 , 97221 , 2039 , and 158980 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/227312/is-saying-good-luck-prohibited
