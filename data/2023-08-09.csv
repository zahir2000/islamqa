223465,"If I said to someone: I asked you by Allah not to do that, then he did it and did not care about me asking him not to do it, what is the ruling on that? And do I have to offer expiation for breaking an oath?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIf someone says to another person: I asked you by Allah not to do such and such, his words are not regarded as an oath. Based on that, he does not have to offer expiation if the other person does not respond to his request.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAs for his saying, “I asked you by Allah to do such and such,” this is a request and not an oath. In the hadith it says: “Whoever asks of you by Allah, give to him.” No expiation is required for that, if he does not respond to his request.""(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa\xa0 1/206).\nSecondly:\nThe one of whom a request is made by saying “by Allah” should respond to the one who makes the request, out of veneration and respect for Allah, may He be exalted, so long as the one who asked did not ask for something to which he has no right, or asked for something that would subject the one who was asked to harm or difficulty.\nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 153727 for the ruling on responding to one who asks by Allah.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/223465/if-he-said-to-someone-i-asked-you-by-allah-not-to-do-such-and-such-is-what-he-said-regarded-as-an-oath
150659,"I divorced my wife three times during an argument that was very heated, when I had not consummated the marriage with her and had only done the marriage contract. What is the Islamic ruling: is this considered a divorce, or what should I do?","['Praise be to Allah.If a man divorces his wife three times in separate words, such as saying: “You are divorced, divorced, divorced” or “You are divorced and divorced and divorced,” a before consummating the marriage, it counts as a single irrevocable divorce according to the majority of scholars, because she becomes completely divorced from him with the uttering of the first word of divorce, and the subsequent words serve no purpose because she is not required to observe ‘iddah.\nSee: Bada’i‘ as-Sana’i‘ (3/137); Hashiyat Ibn ‘Abidin (3/287); Mughni al-Muhtaj (4/482); al-Mughni (7/367).\nIf he divorced her three times in a single phrase, such as saying, “You are thrice divorced,” then it counts as three, according to the majority of scholars. Some of the scholars are of the view that it counts as one divorce, and becomes completely divorced from him; however, because she was divorced before consummation of the marriage, she becomes permissible for him to marry with a new marriage contract. This is the view of ‘Ata’, Tawus, Sa‘id ibn Jubayr, Abu’sh-Sha‘tha’ and ‘Amr ibn Dinar. It is the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam and a number of contemporary scholars, including Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) and Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him).\nSee: al-Mughni (7/282); Fatawa ash-Shaykh Ibn Baz (21/430); ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘ (13/40).\nBased on that, if you divorced your wife before consummating the marriage, issuing three divorces even if that was in a single phrase, then she is divorced from you, but you can do a new marriage contract with a new mahr, after which two talaqs will remain.\nWhat you must do is beware of taking lightly the matter of issuing divorce (talaq), because of the consequences to which it may lead of ending the marriage and breaking it up without that being the intention of the one who issues the divorce.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/150659/he-divorced-her-three-times-before-consummating-the-marriage
