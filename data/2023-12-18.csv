289172,Is it haram to use live bait to catch fish with worms or another kind of small animal that tends to help alot when catching fish compared to using fake equipment?,"['Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with fishing using live worms or some insects or small fish, if there is a need to do so. But if there is no need for that, it is disliked (makruh), because it involves tormenting these creatures.\nIt says in Kashshaf al-Qina‘ (3/152): It is valid to sell that which may be used as bait, such as an owl that is used as bait by tying it up, and when the target bird comes to it, it is caught. It is disliked (makruh) to do that, because it involves tormenting the bird that is used as bait. It is also valid to sell worms for fishing.”\nIf it is possible to kill the worms by removing their heads before using them as bait, and they are still good to use for fishing, then that is better.\nMuslim (1955) narrated that Shaddad ibn Aws said: There are two things that I memorized from the Messenger of Allah (blessing and peace of Allah be upon him). He said: “Allah has prescribed proficiency in all things, so if you kill, kill well, and if you slaughter, slaughter well. Let one of you sharpen his blade and spare suffering to the animal he slaughters.”\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/289172/ruling-on-using-live-bait-for-fishing
246965,"Which of these phrases is a metonymic statement of divorce: “our Lord will spread out for you of His mercy” [Al-Kahf 18:16] or “O Allah, compensate me with someone better than her and compensate her with someone better than me”?","['Praise be to Allah.Guidelines on Implicit phrases of divorce\nThe guideline with regard to metonymic (implicit)\xa0statements of divorce is that metonymic statements include any phrase that may be understood as referring to divorce or something else, such as: “Go to your family ,” or: “It is over between us ,” and so on.\nIn Hashiyat Al-Bujayrami `Ala Al-Khatib (3/491), it says:\n“With regard to the words “any phrase that may be understood as referring to divorce or something else”, the guideline is that this applies to wording that may indicate an imminent separation, but it is not widely used as a Shar`i term or a customary term.”\nIn Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah (29/26), it says:\n“The scholars are agreed that the metonymic form of divorce means using words that are not usually used for that purpose but could be understood as meaning divorce or something else. However, if the wording could never mean divorce in the first place, then this is not a metonymic form of divorce; rather it is merely nonsense talk and does not imply anything.”\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Any wording that could be understood to refer to separation comes under the heading of metonymic statements of divorce."" (Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti`\xa0 13/70)\nDoes divorce count when lmplicit phrases are used?\nDivorce does not count as such when metonymic phrases are used, unless two conditions are fulfilled:\n\nthe person should have the intention of divorce,\xa0\nand he should have used words that are indicative of divorce.\xa0\n\nIf he utters words that are not indicative of divorce , either in Shar`i terms or according to customary usage, then even if he intended divorce by using those words, it does not count as such.\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Divorce does not count as such unless the person intends it and uses wording that is indicative of divorce. If one of these two factors is missing, then no divorce takes place.\nWords and phrases may be divided into those that are explicit and those that are metonymic. Although dividing them in this manner is acceptable in principle, the issue may vary from one person, time or place to another. Therefore, there is no fixed ruling on a particular phrase; a phrase may be regarded as explicit among some people and as metonymic among others, or it may be regarded as explicit in one time or place, and as metonymic in some other time or place.\nWe see this in reality. Hardly anyone uses the phrase “release” [Al-Ahzab 33:28] with regard to divorce, either explicitly or metonymically, so it is not appropriate to suggest that if a man uses this word then his divorce of his wife is binding, whether he intended it or not."" (Zad Al-Ma‘ad\xa0 5/291)\nBased on that, the phrase “our Lord will spread out for you of His mercy” [Al-Kahf 18:16] is not indicative of divorce, either according to customary usage or in Shar`i terms. Based on that, it is not a metonymic form of divorce.\nAs for the phrase “O Allah, compensate me with someone better than her and compensate her with someone better than me”, it was narrated from Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) that any supplication that refers to divorce could be used as a form of divorce.\xa0\nHe was asked about a man who said to his wife: May Allah separate me and you in this world and the hereafter. He said: If he intended it as a supplication only, I hope that it does not mean anything. (Masa’il Abu Dawud lil Imam Ahmad (p. 239); Al-Insaf, 8/478)\nIbn Muflih (may Allah have mercy on him) commented on this in Al-Furu` (9/38):\n“He did not regard it as meaning anything when one’s intention is simply supplication, from which we may understand that it means something when there is an intention of divorce, or when it is used in general terms, on the basis that the word separate or separation is an explicit term, or because of the context in which he said it.”\nThen he (may Allah have mercy on him) mentioned a similar case and said:\n“The ruling concerning these three issues is the same. It seems that concerning each issue there are two views: will the context be taken into account and is it sufficient to indicate his intention, or should only the intention be taken into account?”\nWhat that means is: the supplication “May Allah separate me and you in this world and the hereafter” is a metonymic form of divorce. There are two reports from Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) about metonymic forms of divorce and whether the intention is essential for the divorce to be valid, or is circumstantial evidence sufficient? In a number of Fatwas on our website we have stated that the correct view is that metonymic forms of divorce do not count as such unless they are accompanied by the intention of divorce, and circumstantial evidence is not sufficient.\nBased on that, the supplication mentioned in the question, “O Allah, compensate me with someone better than her and compensate her with someone better than me”, is a metonymic form of divorce; if the husband intended divorce thereby, then it counts as such, and if he did not intend that, then it does not count as such.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/246965/guidelines-concerning-implicit-phrases-of-divorce
475691,"I am going to get a job, in sha Allah, for which I meet all the required conditions, but this job can only be got through having a personal connection (wasta or wasitah), and I have a personal connection. If I get this job through the help of this personal connection, will my salary be haram, noting that I meet all the conditions required for the job?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe ruling on using personal connections to get a job varies according to the qualifications of the one who is applying for the job and according to the nature of the job for which he is applying.\n1.\nIf the applicant for this job is qualified for it and deserves it, then using personal connections to get the job is permissible. In fact it comes under the heading of interceding for a good cause. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{ Whoever intercedes for a good cause will have a share in the reward, and whoever intercedes for an evil cause will have a share in the burden. And Allah is Watchful over all things}\xa0[Al-Nisa’ 4:85].\nBut if the applicant is not qualified for the job, or the one who is intervening wants to give him precedence over someone who is more qualified than him for that position, then his seeking the help of personal connections and intervention for him – by one who knows that he is not qualified – is not permissible, because it is depriving the one who is more qualified of being appointed to that job, in which case it comes under the heading of interceding in a bad cause, {and whoever intercedes for an evil cause will have a share in the burden. And Allah is Watchful over all things}.\nIn Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Da’imah, it says: If the intervention by the middleman on your behalf results in depriving someone who is more qualified and has more right to the position than you, in the sense that he has more of the knowledge that is required for that post and greater ability to cope with its responsibilities and to do the required activities proficiently, then intervening is haram, because it is wronging the one who is more deserving of it, and it is wronging the bosses by depriving them of the work and service of qualified people and is depriving those in authority of the help of such people to advance in some field of work. It is also transgressing against the community by depriving them of those who are proficient in their work and could take care of the organisation’s activities in the best manner. Moreover, in addition to that, it creates grudges and suspicion, and spreads corruption in society.\nBut if that does not lead to anyone being deprived of his rights, or some of them, then it is permissible. In fact it is encouraged according to Islamic teaching, and the one who intervenes will be rewarded for it, in sha Allah. It is proven that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Intercede, you will be rewarded and Allah will decree on the lips of His Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) whatever He wills.”""(Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Da’imah\xa025/289).\n2.\nThe ruling on using personal connections to get a job in the public sector is different to using it to get a job in the private sector. What is mentioned above about it not being allowed if the person is not qualified for the job only applies to public-sector jobs, because public-sector jobs are a right shared by all people, in which all qualified people are equal on the basis of their academic qualifications and abilities, so no one has any advantage over anyone else except on the basis of his qualifications, and those in charge must choose the most qualified applicant for the public sector, without any favouritism or bribery.\nBut when it comes to jobs in the private sector, this ruling does not apply, so it is permissible for someone to ask another person to intercede in his favour when applying for a job in the private sector, even if there is someone more qualified than him. That is on condition that the company owners are aware of the level and qualifications of the applicant, and they agree to accept him as an employee in their company, so that there will be no deceit.\nThe reason for that is that this is a private enterprise, and the owners have the right to run it in the way they want, and they are not obliged to give precedence to the most qualified and most deserving, in contrast to public-sector jobs, where it is not permissible to give precedence to an applicant who is unqualified over one who is qualified for the job.\nSecondly:\nThe ruling on whether the salary is permissible or not has nothing to do with the ruling on finding a job through personal connections (wasta). In the situation where it is haram to get a job through personal connections, this prohibition is applicable to the one who seeks the help of a middleman or the middleman himself – if he is aware of the applicant’s situation, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Whoever intercedes for a good cause will have a share in the reward, and whoever intercedes for an evil cause will have a share in the burden. And Allah is Watchful over all things}\xa0[Al-Nisa’ 4:85].\nWhat is meant by a share in the burden is a share in the burden of sin.\nWith regard to the salary, if the person is proficient in his work and does it in the manner required, then the salary is halal, but if he got the public-sector job through personal connections in the beginning, his salary is regarded as haram, because he had transgressed against the rights of someone else.\nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 60199 .\nBased on the above:\nIt is permissible for you to try to get this job through personal connections, if it is in the public sector and you are qualified to do that work. In this case, you do not have to find out how qualified other applicants are, and whether they are more highly qualified than you or not, because of the difficulty involved in that, and because if you are qualified for that position, that is sufficient grounds to make you deserve to have an equal right to that post.\nBut if the job is in the private sector, the matter is more lenient, so long as the company owners are the ones who will be employing you, because it is their wealth and they have the freedom to dispose of it, giving or withholding it according to what they think is best for their own interests.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/475691/what-is-the-ruling-on-using-a-personal-connection-wasta-to-help-find-a-job-in-the-public-or-private-sector
112902,"I worked in a  Riba-based bank for 17 years, and Allah, may He be Exalted, has helped me to keep away from Riba, and I have noticed a great change in my life. But lawful provision is very difficult to find nowadays. I have not been able to find work for 2.5 years, and I have a family of five to support.","['Praise be to Allah.Working for a company that delivers documents and parcels\nWorking for a company that transports documents and parcels is permissible in and of itself, but if the company specialises in transporting unlawful things , such as delivering documents for Riba-based banks, or transporting alcohol, movies or music, then working for it becomes unlawful in and of itself.\xa0\nIf the company mixes both lawful and unlawful matters, then the ruling depends on which forms the majority of its work. It is also necessary to avoid being involved directly in any unlawful activities.\nBased on that, you may go ahead with your application for a job in that company having to do with work in which you will be supervising and solving problems. Whatever is unlawful, do not do it, but with regard to permissible documents and parcels, you may do it.\xa0\nIf the job is based on this condition and within these limitations, it is permissible for you to work there, otherwise you will be sinning to the extent that you deal directly with unlawful activities, such as transporting and receiving alcohol, or transporting and receiving movies and music, and transporting and receiving documents having to do with Riba and insurance.\xa0\nThe same applies to anything unlawful that is sent or received by this company, where you have any role to play in sending or receiving it.\nIs transporting alcohol permissible?\nUndoubtedly transporting alcohol is one of the unlawful matters that come under the heading of cooperating in sin and transgression, and the one who does it is subject to the curse that is mentioned in the authentic Sunnah. This prohibition applies to everything that Allah, may He be Exalted, has prohibited.\nThe scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas were asked:\nThere is a man who cannot find work except in a factory that produces alcohol, or a depot where it is stored, or in a shops or stores that sell and distribute it. What is the situation of the money that he earns and spends on his dependents, who are numerous?\nThey replied:\n“It is not permissible for a Muslim to work in a factory that produces alcohol, or a depot that stores it, or in any kind of work that has to do with alcohol. The money he earns for that is unlawful, and he has to look for work in which his earnings will be lawful, and to repent to Allah, may He be Glorified, for what he has done in the past, because Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Help you one another in Al-Birr and At-Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression. And fear Allah. Verily, Allah is Severe in punishment.”\xa0[Al-Ma’idah 5:2]\nAnd because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) cursed alcohol, the one who drinks it, the one who pours it, the one who presses (the grapes, etc.), the one for whom it is pressed, the one who carries it, the one to whom it is carried, the one who sells it, the one who buys it, and the one who consumes its price. (Al-Bukhari and Muslim).”\xa0 (Shaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn Baz, Shaykh `Abd Ar-Razzaq `Afeefi, Shaykh `Abdullah ibn Ghadyan, Shaykh `Abdullah ibn Qa`ud, Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 14/114)\nServing alcohol to non-Muslims\nWith regard to this ruling, it makes no difference whether the person to whom it is delivered is a non-Muslim or a Muslim.\nThe scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas were asked:\nThere are some teachers who ask the students for some unlawful drinks. Is taking it to the teacher, who is a non-Muslim, unlawful or not?\nThey replied:\n“It is not permissible for a Muslim to offer alcohol to one who will drink it , because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) cursed the one who carries it and the one to whom it is carried, and because this comes under the heading of cooperating in sin and transgression , which Allah, may He be Exalted, forbade in the verse in which He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Help you one another in Al-Birr and At-Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression.”\xa0[Al-Ma’idah 5:2]” (Shaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn Baz, Shaykh `Abdullah ibn Ghadyan, Shaykh Salih Al-Fawzan, Shaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz Al Ash-Shaykh, Shaykh Bakr Abu Zayd, Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 22/97)\nWe advise you to look for lawful work, and to keep away from anything unlawful. We think that it will be difficult for you to avoid unlawful things in that company, and we hope that Allah, may He be Exalted, will honour you by His grace with work that is better than it. Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And whosoever fears Allah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty). And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allah, then He will suffice him. Verily, Allah will accomplish his purpose. Indeed Allah has set a measure for all things.”\xa0[At-Talaq 65:2-3]\nIt is narrated in an authentic report from our Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that he said: “Whoever gives up something for the sake of Allah, Allah will compensate him with something better than it.” (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) in Hijab Al-Mar’ah Al-Muslimah, p. 49)\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/112902/can-muslims-work-for-companies-that-deliver-documents-and-parcels
