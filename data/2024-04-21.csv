481783,"If there is a woman that can not have children due any reason , would it be halal to use artificial womb to have children.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIf the wife is not able to get pregnant in the natural manner, there is nothing wrong with using artificial insemination or what is known as “test-tube babies”. This refers to fertilising the egg in a test tube, then implanting it in the wife’s uterus. That is subject to the condition that the sperm and egg come from the husband and wife respectively, and the fertilised egg is not implanted in the womb of another woman (surrogate pregnancy).\nIt says in a statement issued by the Islamic Fiqh Council during its seventh session in 1404 AH:\n“The third method is that in which the semen and egg from a man and woman who are married to one another are taken and fertilisation occurs externally, in a test tube, then the fertilised egg is implanted in the uterus of the wife, from whom the egg was taken. This method is acceptable in principle from an Islamic perspective, but it is not completely free of problems that could give rise to doubts concerning the procedure and the circumstances in which it is done. So it should not be resorted to except in cases of extreme necessity, after all the conditions referred to above are met.”\nThese conditions include:\n“C. In the case where uncovering the ‘awrah of the woman is permitted for a legitimate reason in front of someone with whom sexual intercourse is not permissible, the one who is providing treatment should be a Muslim woman, if possible. Otherwise, it should be a non-Muslim woman; if that is not possible then it should be a trustworthy male Muslim doctor; and if that is not possible, it may be a non-Muslim male. This is the order of preference.\nIt is not permissible for the treatment provider to be alone with the woman whom he is treating; rather her husband or another woman should also be present.\nThe Council has affirmed that the need of a married woman who cannot have children and the need of the husband to have children are regarded as legitimate needs that make it permissible to treat the woman in a permissible manner, using one of the methods of artificial insemination.""(Qararat al-Majma‘ al-Fiqhi bi Makkah al-Mukarramah, p. 149).\nSecondly:\nIf it is not possible to implant the fertilised egg in the uterus of the wife because she is suffering from uterine cancer, for example, then there comes to mind the idea of an artificial womb.\nDr. Muhammad ibn Ha’il al-Madhaji said: The idea [of the artificial womb] may be summed up as allowing the fertilised human egg to settle in an artificial womb by re-creating the natural environment of the woman’s uterus in a plastic incubator to enable the foetus to go through all the stages of development until it reaches the point of birth, whereby the foetus is placed in artificial fluid and its blood is supplied with oxygen. The foetus remains in that incubator, which guarantees all that is required for life and survival outside the uterus, until it is fully developed and the time comes for it to emerge.""(Ahkam an-Nawazil fi’l-Injab, p. 587).\nHe researched the ruling on this issue and mentioned different scholarly views, noting that most contemporary scholars who researched this issue were of the view that it is permissible. He quoted the evidence given by the two groups, and reached the following conclusions:\n1.. This idea is something that could never happen, because it is not possible to produce an environment that may be described as “a safe repository” (al-Mu’minun 23:13) like the natural womb, for the foetus to grow in. Even if science were able to produce such a thing, it is unlikely that the foetus would be safe and free from harm.\n2.. The view that it is haram is more likely to be correct, because it is contrary to the natural way that has been decreed by Allah, and there is great potential for harm.\nThe doctor mentioned that the goat foetuses that were subjected to experiments of this nature died a few days after birth, even though they grew in their mothers’ wombs except for the last three weeks before birth.\nSee: Ahkam an-Nawazil fi’l-Injab, p. 862.\nConclusion:\nThis method has not yet been proven to have been tried on humans as far as we know, let alone having been proven to be free of harm.\nWhat appears to be the case is that if it is proven to have been tried on humans, then in order for it to be permissible, the following conditions must be met:\n1.. It must meet the conditions of artificial insemination referred to above.\n2.. The tissues that are used to create the artificial womb must be permissible tissues and not haram; they should not be taken from anyone other than the husband and wife.\n3.. The procedure must be free of anything that could harm the foetus.\n4.. It should be not possible to implant the fertilised egg in the wife’s womb.\nWe re-affirm that surrogate pregnancy is haram, as stated previously in the answer to question no. 22126 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/481783/what-is-the-ruling-on-using-an-artificial-womb-to-have-children
224876,Who has the right to decide the amount of Mahr (dowry or gift given by groom to his bride during marriage or Nikah)? How much should it be? Is a marriage valid without Mahr?,"['Praise be to Allah.Who decides the amount of the Mahr?\nDeciding the amount of the Mahr is to be left to the woman and her guardian. If the woman disagrees with her guardian about the amount of the Mahr, then what appears to be the case from the words of the scholars is that they should take as a reference the Mahr of a woman of similar standing.\nIf she agrees to the Mahr of a woman of similar standing, but he (the guardian) wants more than that, then no attention should be paid to his wishes. If he is the one who wants a Mahr like that of a woman of similar standing, but she wants less than that, then what matters is his view.\xa0\nHow much should the Mahr be?\nWith regard to the amount of the Mahrf , there is no set limit. Rather it is whatever is agreed upon by the couple or by the husband and the woman’s guardian, whether it is small or great, but the Sunnah is to make the Mahr smaller and to be easy-going concerning this matter. This is the practice of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\xa0\nIs marriage valid without a Mahr?\nIt is essential to have a Mahr in the case of marriage. Once the amount of the Mahr has been agreed upon, at that point it becomes a right only for the woman, which the guardian must hand over to her, and not take anything from it except with her consent.\xa0\nAfter the marriage contract , it is permissible for her to give up to her husband all of the Mahr or part of it, on condition that she be of sound mind.\xa0\nIf marriage occurs without a Mahr , it is still valid, but the woman is still entitled to a Mahr like that of a woman of similar standing.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/224876/who-decides-mahr
241534,"What is the scholars’ view of putting certain things on top of religious books, whether they are books having to do with jurisprudence, creed or Qur’anic exegesis, or putting religious books on top of one another?","['Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with putting religious books on top of one another, but they should not be placed on top of the Mushaf.\nAl-Hakim at-Tirmidhi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nBecause of the sanctity of the Mushaf, if it is placed on a shelf it should not be left open, and no other books should be put on top of it, so that it will always be above other books.""(Nawadir al-Usul\xa03/254).\nOther books should not be placed on top of religious books, such as educational books or others. Also, other things – such as vessels, clothes, food and so on –should not be placed on top of them, out of respect for what they contain of mention of Allah and Islamic sciences.\nAl-Haytami (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAl-Bayhaqi – like al- Halimi – said: The best is not to put anything on top of the Mushaf except another Mushaf, such as a book or garment. Al-Halimi added to that: books of hadith from the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).""(Al-Fatawa al-Hadithiyyah\xa0 p. 164).\nThe ruling could become a prohibition if that is indicative of disrespect or mistreatment of religious books.\nIbn Muflih (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIbn ‘Abd al-Qawiy said in his book Majma‘ al-Bahrayn: It is haram to lean on the Mushaf and on books of hadith and anything that contains some Qur’an, according to scholarly consensus.""(Al-Adab ash-Shar‘iyyah\xa0 2/393).\nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 222344 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/241534/putting-things-on-top-of-religious-books
22292,"Some people regard it as a good or bad omen when they hear a sound in one of their ears, or if their eyelid twitches, and so on. Is there any basis for this?","['Praise be to Allah.There is no basis for regarding ringing in the ears as good or bad omen in Islam. The Muslim has to put his trust in Allah. Regarding things as bad omens is a kind of belief in evil omens, which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) declared to be false and stated that it is a form of polytheism.\xa0\nIf a person notices any such thing (ringing in the ears, etc.), he should ignore it and go ahead with his plans, and not hesitate.\xa0\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Tiyarah (superstition) is that which makes you go ahead or refrain.”\nThe Muslim should also recite the following Du`a: “Allahumma la yu`ti bi’l-hasanat illa anta wa la yadfa` as-sayi’at illa anta, wa la hawla wa la quwwata illa bika (O Allah, none can bring good things except You, and none can ward off evil things except You, and there is no power and no strength except with You).”\nAs for seeing something and interpreting it in an optimistic manner, this is good, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to like optimism. Optimism means thinking well of Allah.\xa0\nFor more details, please refer to the following answers: 46985 , 97221 , 2039 , 33842 , 126359 , 33844 , 362868 , and 8291 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22292/does-the-ringing-of-the-ear-mean-bad-omen-in-islam
