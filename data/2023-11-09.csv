394904,"The wife left and went to her family’s house without the consent of her husband. After going through khul‘ and separation, she wants to spend the ‘iddah period following divorce in her husband’s house. Is it permissible for the husband to not allow her to spend the ‘iddah period in his house, or will he be sinning? Please note that she has moved all her belongings to her family’s house, and she wants to do that in order to make life difficult for the second wife and her ex-husband.","['Praise be to Allah.If khul‘ or divorce (talaq) in return for compensation has been completed, then the woman is divorced completely from her husband and her divorce comes under the heading of baynunah sughra; she has become a stranger to him, so it is not permissible for him to be alone with her, and she is not obliged to observe ‘iddah in his house, and he is not obliged to let her stay. But if they agree that she can observe ‘iddah in his house, there must be someone else there so that they will not be alone together, and she must cover in front of her ex-husband.\nIt says in al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (25/117): If the ex-husband’s house is spacious enough for both of them, and she can live in a separate room with a lockable door (and with all necessary facilities), whilst the ex-husband lives in the rest of the house, it is permissible. If there is no lockable door between them, but she has a mahram with her who can protect her from being alone with him, it is permissible. Otherwise, it is not permissible. End quote.\nAl-Bahuti (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The woman who is completely divorced may observe ‘iddah wherever she wants in her city, in a safe place. She does not have to observe ‘iddah in his house, because Fatimah bint Qays narrated that Abu Amr ibn Hafs divorced her completely whilst he was absent, and he sent something to her but she did not like it, so he [‘Amr’s envoy] said: By Allah, you are not entitled to anything from us. She came to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and told him about that, and he said: “You are not entitled to maintenance or accommodation from him.” He told her to observe ‘iddah in the house of Umm Sharik, then he said: “She is a woman whom my companions visit; observe ‘iddah in the house of Ibn Umm Maktum.” Agreed upon.""(Kashshaf al-Qina‘\xa0 5/434).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If he has issued a third divorce (talaq), and there is someone else in the house so that she will not be alone with the husband who divorced her, then there is nothing wrong with her remaining in the house, but she may move to her family’s house. But if there is no one in the house except the man who divorced her for a third time, then she must leave, because she is completely divorced from him and is no longer permissible for him. Based on that, it is not permissible for him to be alone with her. Therefore she must leave and go to her family’s house.""(Fatawa Nur ‘ala al-Darb).\nBased on that, you do not have to let her observe her ‘iddah in your house, because she is not entitled to accommodation.\nIn the case of one who is revocably divorced (first or second talaq), she should observe ‘iddah in the marital home, and it is not permissible to make her leave.\nIt says in Sharh Muntaha al-Iradat (3/206): The revocably divorced woman should stay in the house of her husband, but not in the case of mourning, such as the one whose husband has died. This was stated by Imam Ahmad. That is because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Do not turn them out of their [husbands’] houses, nor should they [themselves] leave [during that period]}\xa0[Al-Talaq 65:1].\nIt makes no difference whether the husband gave her permission to leave or not, because it is one of her rights during the ‘iddah, and it is a right ordained by Allah, may He be exalted. So the husband has no authority to waive any of her rights, just as he has no right to waive the ‘iddah.

152261,"Is it permissible to go fishing as a sport, knowing that we will not waste or mess about with the fish; rather we will eat it?","['Praise be to Allah.Is fishing prohibited?\nThe basic ruling with regard to hunting [translator’s note: in Arabic the same word is used to refer to hunting or fishing] is that it is permissible, except for one who is in a state of Ihram (for Hajj or `Umrah) or one who is in the Haram zone (the boundaries of the Makkan Sanctuary). This applies to hunting on land; with regard to fishing and the pursuit of other aquatic creatures, it is not prohibited for the one who is in Ihram. Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Lawful to you is what you catch from the sea and its use for food - for the benefit of yourselves and those who travel, but forbidden is what you catch on land as long as you are in a state of Ihram (for Hajj or Umrah). And fear Allah to Whom you shall be gathered back.”\xa0[Al-Ma’idah 5:96]\nIf a person hunts permissible animals with a permissible intention, such as earning a living by selling them or eating them, there is nothing wrong with hunting or catching them, according to scholarly consensus.\xa0\nSimilarly, if a person’s main aim, when catching fish, is permissible in principle, such as leisure and the like, but he will make use of what he catches, such as selling it or eating it, and so on, then there is nothing wrong with him doing such things.\xa0\nIs fishing prohibited as a sport?\nIf the hunter or fisherman does not have any particular need for what he catches, and he is only doing it for sport (as a leisure activity or for fun), then the ruling on hunting or fishing in this case changes from permissible to disliked.\xa0\nIt says in Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah (28/115):\xa0\n“If it is known that the basic principle with regard to hunting (or fishing) is that it is permissible, it cannot be deemed to be otherwise, or to be deemed disliked, prohibited or recommended or obligatory except in specific cases for which there is specific evidence, as follows:\xa0\n… Hunting or fishing is disliked if the purpose behind it is to have fun or do it as a leisure activity, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not take any living being as a target.”\xa0(Narrated by Muslim, 1957).”\xa0\nMore than one of the scholars have stated that hunting and fishing in this case is disliked.\xa0\nAl-Nafrawi Al-Maliki (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Hunting for fun is disliked.” (Al-Fawakih Ad-Dawani, 1/390)\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Hunting to meet a need is permissible; as for hunting for no purpose other than leisure or sport, it is disliked, and if it involves wronging people by transgressing upon their crops or property, then it is prohibited.”(Al-Fatawa Al-Kubra, 5/550)\nShaykh Mansur Al-Buhuti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“It is disliked to hunt for sport, because that is an idle pursuit. If the hunting involves wronging people by transgressing upon their crops or property, then it is prohibited, because the means take the same ruling as the ends.” (Kashshaf Al-Qina`, 6/213)\nIbn `Abidin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“In Majma‘ Al-Fatawa it says: (Hunting) is disliked if it is for leisure.” (Radd Al-Muhtar, 5/297)\nIs it permissible to fish as a sport if one will benefit from it?\nIf the purpose of the hunting or fishing is leisure and sport, but the person will benefit from it, by either eating, selling or giving away his catch as a gift and the like, then it no longer comes under the ruling of being disliked, as mentioned here, and the hunting or fishing reverts to the original ruling of permissibility, because in this case it is not purely for the purpose of sport and it does not involve damage to property\xa0 or tormenting the animals caught.\xa0\nShaykh Muhammad ibn Ibrahim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“It is not prescribed to cause death to a living being for sport, such as hunters shooting from moving vehicles, when the intention is not to eat it or feed it to others. In the Hadith it says: “Whoever kills a sparrow unlawfully will be questioned about it.” ( Fatawa wa Rasa’il Muhammad ibn Ibrahim Aal Ash-Shaykh, 12/231)\xa0\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“If it is for an Islamically-acceptable purpose, such as eating or selling it, as in the case of those who catch bustards, lizards and rabbits, and other permissible animals, to eat them or sell them, then there is nothing wrong with it. However, if a person is hunting or fishing in order to kill the animal and leave it there, this is not right. The least that can be said about it is that it is very disliked. No one should hunt an animal that can be eaten unless it is for a purpose, either to eat it or feed it to the poor or give it as a gift or sell it. As for hunting it for sport, that is not permissible; it is a kind of leisure or “fun” that is not appropriate on the part of the believer. It was narrated that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade hunting, except for food or to make use of (the animal caught).” (From the\xa0website of Shaykh Ibn Baz)\nTo sum up, hunting or fishing, as mentioned in the question, is permissible and there is nothing wrong with it, so long as it is possible to make use of what is caught, by eating it, selling it and so on.\xa0\nFor more details, please see this category: Rulings on sport, leisure and entertainment\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/152261/is-fishing-prohibited-in-islam
415312,"How can I attain love for Allah, for I do not feel that?","['Praise be to Allah.What appears to us to be the case is that your concept of love is not correct, or that you limiting it to a high level of love. Otherwise, everyone who believes in the existence of Allah is not devoid of love for Him, even if he associates others with Him in love, and loves others as much as or more than he loves Him, as Allah, may He be exalted, says of the polytheists (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Yet there are some people who take [for worship] others besides Allah, as equals [with Allah]; they love them as they should love Allah. But those who believe have greater love for Allah}\xa0[Al-Baqarah 2:165].\nEveryone who believes in Allah and remembers some of the blessings that He has bestowed upon him – such as the blessings of Islam, the Qur’an, provision, help and support, and so on – will love Him, for man has a natural inclination to love the one who bestows favours upon him. Hence he loves the one who greets him, the one who gives him a gift, the one who smiles at him, the one who is sincere towards him and the one who honours him.\nSo check your heart, and you will find that you do love Allah, praise Him, give thanks to Him and perhaps you long to see Him, and this is the highest level of love.\nIf you ask yourself: do you hate Allah? You will recoil from this question, and this confirms what we have mentioned to you, that perhaps you imagine love as longing, for example. Or your love may not have reached that level, but that does not mean that you do not have beneficial love for Allah which makes your faith in Him sound.\nWhatever the case, the remedy for that is easy: it is remembering the blessings, the greatest of which is the blessing of Islam. Then if you read the words of Allah and reflect a little, that will open your heart and you will feel happy; you will find yourself praising Allah for this blessing, and you will find your heart beating with love for your Creator Who blessed you with that.\nUndoubtedly, some people may become completely immersed in this world and its transient pleasures, or in haram desires, so their hearts grow hard, their love for Allah is reduced, their longing for Him grows weak and perhaps they forget their Creator. But if they look deep in their hearts, they will find that they do love Allah, even though they are heedless and distant from Him.\nHence it is essential to make sure that you love Allah and that that love is above all other loves, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Say: If your fathers, your sons, your brothers, your spouses, your clan, the wealth that you have acquired, the merchandise which you fear will not be sold, and the dwellings in which you delight, are dearer to you than Allah and His Messenger, and striving and fighting in His cause, then wait until Allah brings about His decree [of punishment]. For Allah does not guide disobedient people}\xa0[Al-Tawbah 9:24].\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There are three characteristics, whoever attains them has found the sweetness of faith: when Allah and His Messenger are more beloved to him than all else, when he loves a man and does not love him except for the sake of Allah, and when he would hate to return to disbelief after Allah has saved him from it as he would hate to be thrown into the fire.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (16) and Muslim (43).\nSo turn to Allah, be consistent in offering prayers, and glorify Allah a great deal (tasbih) and call upon Him (du‘a’) when you prostrate; call to mind His blessings and be among those who are grateful; recite a daily portion of Qur’an and do not omit it; observe some supererogatory fasts and give voluntary charity. These are things which soften the heart and cure it of hardness, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{those who believe and whose hearts find comfort in the remembrance of Allah, for verily in the remembrance of Allah hearts find comfort}\xa0[Al-Ra‘d 13:28].\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Shall I not tell you of that which will take away rancour from the heart? Fast three days of every month.” Narrated by al-Nasa’i (2386); classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Nasa’i (2249).\nAl-Suyuti said in Sharh al-Nasa’i: “Regarding the meaning of the words wahar al-sadr [translated above as rancour in the heart], it says in al-Nihayah that this refers to the dross of the heart and intrusive thoughts. It was also said that it refers to resentment and rage, or enmity, or intense anger. End quote.\nAl-Sindi said: “That which will take away rancour from the heart”– it was said that this refers to its dross and intrusive thoughts, or grudges, or what may befall the heart of contamination and hardness. End quote.\nIt was narrated that Abu’l-Darda’ (may Allah be pleased with him) said: A man came to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) complaining about the hardness of his heart. He said: “Would you like to soften your heart and get what you need? Show compassion to the orphan and pat his head, and feed him from your own food, and your heart will be softened and your needs will be met.” Narrated by al-Tabarani; classed as hasan by al-Albani in Sahih al-Targhib wa’l-Tarhib.\nMoreover, it is recommended (mustahabb) for the individual to ask his Lord for love of Him and to increase in that love, as it says in the hadith about the dispute among those on high: “[Allah] said: Ask. I said: O Allah, I ask You to enable me to do good deeds and refrain from evil deeds, and to make me love the poor, and to forgive me and have mercy on me. And if You want to test a people, cause me to die without being tested. And I ask You for Your love and the love of those who love You, and for the love of doing that which will bring me closer to Your love.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (3235); classed as sahih by al-Albani.\nWe ask Allah to forgive you, turn to you in mercy, turn your heart towards Him and enable you to taste the sweetness of faith.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/415312/how-can-we-make-ourselves-feel-love-for-allah-in-our-hearts
20473,"My question is about custody of children. I know that if a couple gets divorced, then the mother has more right to the children who have not yet reached the age of independence, but if she remarries then the father has more right. My question is if the father of the children does not fulfil his financial responsibility towards the children, does he still have the right to take them away from the mother? In the particular situation I am speaking of, the man has demonstrated that he is able to provide, because he has remarried and has had a child and is supporting that child, but he is not supporting his two children from the previous marriage. He tells their mother that if she marries again he will take the children, is this right?","['Praise be to Allah.Who has more right to custody in Islam?\nOne of the matters on which there is scholarly consensus is that the woman is more entitled to custody of the child so long as he has not reached the age of discernment, as the child at that stage needs the kind of compassion and care that only women can give. But this right is forfeited if the woman remarries , because she will be distracted by her new husband from taking care of her child, and because there is a conflict of interest between the child and the new husband.\xa0\nIbn Al-Mundhir (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated that there was scholarly consensus that the mother’s right to custody is forfeited if she remarries .\xa0(See: Al-Kafi by Ibn ‘Abd Al-Barr, 1/296; Al-Mughni, 8/194)\xa0\nThis is indicated by the Hadith of `Abdullah ibn `Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) according to whom a woman said: O Messenger of Allah, my womb was a vessel for this son of mine, and my breasts gave him to drink, and my lap was a refuge for him, but his father has divorced me and he wants to take him away from me. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to her: “You have more right to him so long as you do not remarry.” (Narrated by Ahmad (6707) and Abu Dawud (2276); classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud, and classed as sound by Ibn Katheer in Irshad Al-Faqih (2/250))\nIs maintenance of children obligatory upon the father?\nMaintenance of children is obligatory upon the father according to scholarly consensus, whether he keeps his wife or divorces her, and whether the wife is poor or rich. So she is not obliged to spend on the children if the father is around.\xa0\nIf the children are in the custody of a divorced woman , then their father must support them, and the mother who has custody of a child who is still breastfeeding has the right to ask for payment for nursing the child.\xa0\nMaintenance of children includes accommodation, food, drink, clothing and education, and everything that the child needs, and is to be based on what is reasonable, paying attention to the husband’s situation, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Let the rich man spend according to his means; and the man whose resources are restricted, let him spend according to what Allah has given him. Allah puts no burden on any person beyond what He has given him. Allah will grant after hardship, ease.”\xa0[Al-Talaq 65:7]\nThis varies from one country to another and from one person to another.\xa0\nIf the husband is rich then he must spend according to his wealth, and if he is poor or of moderate means, then he must also spend according to his means. If the parents agree upon a specific amount of money, whether it is large or small, then that is up to them. But in the case of a dispute, the one who decides about that is the judge.\xa0\nIt is permissible for a divorced woman to ask her ex-husband for payment for breastfeeding the child , according to scholarly consensus.\xa0\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Mughni:\xa0\n“(The expenses for) breastfeeding the child are to be borne by the father only, and he has no right to force the mother to breastfeed the child if she is divorced, and we know of no difference of opinion concerning that."" (Al-Mughni\xa0 11/430).\nHe also said: “If the mother asks for payment at the usual rate for breastfeeding, she is more entitled to that, whether the father finds someone else to breastfeed him for free or not. "" (Al-Mughni\xa0 11/431)\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“With regard to payment for breastfeeding, she is entitled to that according to scholarly consensus, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And if they breastfeed for you (nurse your child), then give them their payment.”\xa0[Al-Talaq 65:6]."" (Al-Fatawa Al-Kubra\xa0 3/347)\xa0\nIf the father doesn\'t spend on his children, is he entitled to custody in Islam?\nWith regard to custody – as defined by a number of scholars – it means taking care of the one who has not reached the age of discernment and cannot live independently, raising him in accordance with his best interests, and protecting him from anything that may harm him. (Rawdat Al-Talibin, 9/98)\xa0\nThis means, taking care of the small child and looking after him. So the main issue of custody is taking care of the interests of the child. Hence if the father refuses to undertake this duty towards the child, which includes maintenance, then he is sinning, and forfeits his right to custody .\nIt says in Ar-Rawd Al-Murbi`: “The child should not stay with one who does not protect him and take care of him, because that is contrary to the purpose of custody."" (Al-Rawd Al-Murbi’\xa0 3/251)\nIbn Qudamah Al-Maqdisi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Custody is aimed at looking after the child, so it should not be given in a way that will be detrimental to his welfare and his religious commitment."" (Al-Mughni\xa0 8/190) \xa0\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“If we give precedence to one of the parents, we must pay attention to how he looks after the child. Hence Malik and Al-Layth said: If the mother is not in a safe place or she is not of good character, then the father has the right to take the child from her. Similarly, in the well known report from him, Imam Ahmad said that it depends on his ability to take care of the child. If he is careless or unable to do that, or is not of good character, or he is immoral and the mother is different from him, then she undoubtedly has more right to take the daughter. Our Shaykh said: If one of the parents fails to educate the boy and raise him in accordance with Islamic teachings, then he is sinning and has no guardianship over him. Anyone who does not do his duties as a guardian has no guardianship. He should either be dismissed as the guardian and replaced by someone who will do what is required, or someone else should be appointed with him who will do what is required along with him, because the aim is to obey Allah and His Messenger according to one’s ability … If the father marries a woman who does not take care of his daughter, and her mother is better able to take care of her than this co-wife, then custody should definitely be given to the mother ."" (Zad Al-Ma`ad\xa0 5/424)\xa0\nShaykh `Abd Ar-Rahman As-Sa`di said:\xa0\n“If one of them neglects their duties with regard to custody and care of the child, then he forfeits his guardianship and the other should be appointed instead."" (Al-Fatawa As-Sa`diyyah\xa0 p. 535)\nBased on this, if the father refuses to spend on his children’s maintenance, he forfeits the right to custody, even if his refusal is aimed at hurting the mother. This indicates that he is not to be trusted to take care of his children’s interests. The mother has the right to ask him in court for maintenance of his children.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20473/the-father-doesnt-spend-on-children-does-he-get-custody-in-islam
