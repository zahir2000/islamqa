163168,"When I met my husband, before we got married, we were both Muslim, but we (I seek Allah’s forgiveness for that) apostatised from Islam shortly after we met. Then we got married according to British law, and we had a wedding party that was not Islamic (as we were not Muslims at that time). Two years after that, my husband embraced Islam again, but I remained a disbeliever for a few months following that. Then finally I became Muslim again, praise be to Allah, and now we are in the best shape. My question now is: is our marriage valid? If it is not, then what must we do? Please note that everyone around us knows that we are married and that we had a non-Islamic wedding that was attended by people from near and far. But the problem is, as I noted above, that we were not Muslims, and our marriage was according to British law, not according to Islamic sharia.","['Praise be to Allah.If two apostates become Muslim together, then their marriage is recognised, as is the case when two disbelievers who had never been Muslim previously become Muslim. This has been explained previously in the answer to question no. 118752.\nIf one of the spouses becomes Muslim, and the other delays becoming Muslim until the woman’s ‘iddah has ended, then a new marriage contract must be done, according to most of the scholars.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If one of the spouses becomes Muslim, and the other delays becoming Muslim until the woman’s ‘iddah has ended, the marriage is dissolved according to the view of the majority of scholars. Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said: The scholars did not differ regarding that, except for something narrated from an-Nakha‘i, in which he differed from the majority of scholars and no one followed him in that. He claimed that the woman could go back to her husband, even after a long time, because of the report narrated by Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) sent Zaynab back to her husband Abu’l-‘As on the basis of their first marriage contract. This report was narrated by Abu Dawud and cited as evidence by Ahmad. It was said to him: Did he not narrate that he sent her to him on the basis of a new marriage contract? He said: There is no basis for that. And it was said that between the time when she became Muslim and the time when he sent her back to him eight years passed. (End quote from al-Mughni, 7/188).\nSome scholars favoured the view that the marriage is not dissolved, even if the woman’s ‘iddah has ended. Therefore if both spouses want to go back to one another after the ‘iddah has ended, they may do so, and there is no need to do a new marriage contract.\nThis view was favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah and his student Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on them). Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin also regarded it as more likely to be correct (may Allah have mercy on him).\nThey quoted as evidence for that the hadith of Abu’l -‘As referred to above, and the fact that there is no report in the Sunnah to suggest that the matter is connected to the end of the woman’s ‘iddah.\nSee: ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘ (12/245-248).\nBased on this view, your previous marriage contract remains valid and there is no need to do a new marriage contract.\nWe ask Allah to guide you and enable you to do all that is good.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/163168/they-apostatised-and-got-married-then-the-husband-became-muslim-before-her-do-they-need-to-do-a-new-marriage-contract
427817,When were Surat Al-Falaq and Surat An-Nas revealed? Is the Hadith about the eleven knots which were tied to bewitch the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) Sahih?,"['Praise be to Allah.The Hadiths indicate that the Mu`awwidhatayn (Al-Falaq and An-Nas) were revealed in Madinah.\nThis is mentioned in the Hadith of `Uqbah ibn `Amir (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Do you not see verses that have been revealed tonight, the like of which has never been seen? {Say, “I seek refuge in the Lord of daybreak} [Al-Falaq 113; interpretation of the meaning] and {Say, “I seek refuge in the Lord of mankind} [An-Nas 114; interpretation of the meaning].”\n`Uqbah ibn `Amir (may Allah be pleased with him) accompanied the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in Madinah, and these two Surahs were revealed after the bewitching incident.\n`Abd ibn Humayd (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated in\xa0Al-Muntakhab\xa0(1/228): Ahmad ibn Yunus told me: Abu Mu`awiyah told us, from Al-A`mash, from Yazid ibn Hayyan, from Zayd ibn Arqam (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: A Jewish man bewitched the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and he fell sick. Jibril came to him, bringing down Al-Mu`awwidhatayn, and said: A Jewish man has bewitched you, and the item used for witchcraft is in the well of So-and-so. So he sent `Ali, who brought it to him, then he instructed him to untie the knots and recite verses, so he started reciting and untying, until the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) got up as if he had been released from restraints. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not say anything to that Jewish man about what he had done to him, and he never confronted him with it.\nThe narrators of this chain of narration are trustworthy; it was classed as authentic by the commentators on the book, and by Shaykh Al-Albani in\xa0As-Silsilah As-Sahihah (6/617)\nAl-Hafidh Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nHe said: Because of that, Al-Mu`awidhatayn were revealed. (End quote)\nThis was narrated by Ath-Tha`labi from Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) in a Mu`allaq report, and from `A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), also in a Mu`allaq report.\nThe chain of narration going back to `A’ishah is authentic. It was narrated by Sufyan ibn `Uyaynah in his\xa0Tafsir\xa0from Abu `Ubaydillah, from Hisham ibn `Urwah, from his father, from `A’ishah. In it, it says: And {Qul a`udhu bi Rabb il-falaq} [Surat Al-Falaq; interpretation of the meaning] was revealed.”(At-Talkhis Al-Habir\xa0 6/2689.)\nAs for the number of knots being eleven, no sound Hadith has been narrated concerning that.\nAl-Hafidh Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAs-Suhayli stated that the number of knots was eleven, so it was appropriate that the number of verses of the Mu`awwidhatayn should be eleven, so that with every verse, one knot was undone.\nI say: Al-Bayhaqi narrated in\xa0Ad-Dala’il\xa0something similar with an inauthentic chain of narration, in the story in which it is said that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was bewitched… At the end of the Hadith, it says that they found a string in which there were eleven knots, and Surat Al-Falaq and Surat An-Nas were revealed, so every time he recited a verse, one knot came undone.\nIbn Sa`d (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated with an interrupted chain of narration from Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) sent `Ali and `Ammar (may Allah be pleased with them), and they found a string in which there were eleven knots, and he mentioned a similar report.” (End quote from At-Talkhis Al-Habir\xa06/2689-2690.)\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 231102, 82800, 10513, 2241.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/427817/when-were-surat-al-falaq-and-surat-an-nas-revealed
223528,"What I know is that Allah sent Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to all the living, accountable humans and jinn with the message of Islam. But must I also believe that Allah sent him to all creatures? As it is known that the word creatures is more general and includes more than just humans and jinn. Secondly: I know that his message was not only for the humans and jinn of his own time; rather it is for all the humans and jinn, those who lived at his time and those who came after them, but until when? Is it until the first of the major signs of the Hour appear, or until the Hour itself begins?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe Muslims are unanimously agreed, and it is narrated in mutawatir reports from our Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that Allah did indeed send him (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to the jinn and humankind.\n(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, 4/204 and 11/303)\nWith regard to the angels, most of the scholars are of the view that he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was not sent to them.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was sent to the two races, humankind and the jinn, but he was not sent to the angels. (End quote from Majmu‘ al-Fatawa, 12/222.\nHe also said in his book an-Nubuwwat (2/232):\nThe signs of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) which prove his prophethood must be miracles that are extraordinary for both humans and jinn, but it is not stipulated that they should be things that the angels are unable to do, because they (meaning the prophets) were not sent to the angels. (End quote)\nBased on that, it is not correct to say that Allah sent our Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to all creatures, because he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was not sent to the angels. Similarly, he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was not sent to other creatures which possess no reason, because they are not accountable and are not required to follow any divine system of law, such that a messenger would be sent to them from among them or from among others. Rather those who are made accountable, and Allah, may He be exalted, has made them qualified to be accountable, are humankind and the jinn, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was sent to both of them, as noted above.\nSecondly:\nAll of creation testifies to the truthfulness of the message of our Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) except the disbelievers among humankind and the jinn. Ahmad (14333) narrated that Jabir ibn ‘Abdillah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There is nothing between heaven and earth but it knows that I am the Messenger of Allah, except the sinners among the jinn and humankind.” The commentators on al-Musnad classed it as authentic. According to the version narrated by at-Tabarani: “… Except the disbelievers among the jinn and humankind.”\nThirdly:\nThe message of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to humankind and the jinn will remain until Allah inherits the earth and all those on it. Therefore everyone of the two races whom Allah creates until that time is accountable and is required to believe in the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and follow him.\nBut when the sun rises from its place of setting, a seal will be placed on people’s deeds, and whoever had not believed in the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) before that will not benefit from his belief, if he believes after the sun has risen from its place of setting. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Do they [then] wait for anything except that the angels should come to them or your Lord should come or that there come some of the signs of your Lord? The Day that some of the signs of your Lord will come, no soul will benefit from its faith as long as it had not believed before or had earned through its faith some good}\xa0[Al-An‘am 6:158].\nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The Hour will not begin until the sun rises from its place of setting. When the people see that, all those who are on earth will believe, but that will be when no soul will benefit from its faith as long as it had not believed before.” (al-Bukhari and Muslim)\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/223528/was-the-prophet-blessings-and-peace-of-allah-be-upon-him-sent-to-all-creatures-meaning-the-jinn-humans-and-others
266249,"How can I seek Barakah in everything I own, wealth, family, my own self and so on?","['Praise be to Allah.Barakah is one of the blessings of Allah, may He be Exalted, and the blessings of Allah, may He be Exalted, can only be sought and maintained by means of four things:\n\n\nBy obeying Allah, may He be Exalted, and obeying His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). That is achieved by doing what is enjoined and refraining from what is forbidden, and hastening to repent and seek forgiveness in the event of any shortcoming in doing what is obligatory or falling into anything that has been forbidden.\n\n\nAllah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And if only the people of the cities had believed and feared Allah , We would have opened upon them blessings from the heaven and the earth; but they denied [the messengers], so We seized them for what they were earning.} [Al-A`raf 7:96]\nAllah, may He be Exalted, says concerning the call of His Prophet Nuh (peace be upon him) [to his people]:\n{And [I] said, ‘Ask forgiveness of your Lord. Indeed, He is ever a Perpetual Forgiver. He will send [rain from] the sky upon you in [continuing] showers, and give you increase in wealth and children and provide for you gardens and provide for you rivers.} [Nuh 71:10-12]\nAllah, may He be Exalted, says concerning the call of His Prophethood (peace be upon him):\n{And to `Ad [We sent] their brother Hud. He said, `O my people, worship Allah; you have no deity other than Him. You are not but inventors [of falsehood]. O my people, I do not ask you for it any reward. My reward is only from the one who created me. Then will you not reason? And O my people, ask forgiveness of your Lord and then repent to Him. He will send [rain from] the sky upon you in showers and increase you in strength [added] to your strength. And do not turn away, [being] criminals.’} [Hud 11:50-52]\nAllah, may He be Exalted, says regarding the People of the Book (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And if only they upheld [the law of] the Torah, the Gospel, and what has been revealed to them from their Lord, they would have consumed [provision] from above them and from beneath their feet.} [Al-Ma’idah 5:66]\n\n\nOne of the greatest deeds of piety by means of which Barakah may be sought is upholding the ties of kinship, and not cutting off those ties.\n\n\nIt was narrated that Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “Whoever would like his provision to be increased and his life to be extended, should uphold the ties of kinship.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 2067 and Muslim, 2557)\n\n\nSimilarly, he should avoid prohibited matters in his interactions with people, such as cheating, usury and all other things that are forbidden.\n\n\nAllah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Allah destroys interest and gives increase for charities. And Allah does not like every sinning disbeliever.} [Al-Baqarah 2:276]\nThe commentator Shaykh Muhammad Al-Amin Ash-Shinqiti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Allah destroys interest” – in this verse it is clearly stated that He destroys riba (usury, interest), meaning that He will remove it altogether from the possession of the one who engages in it, or He will deprive him of any Barakah in his wealth, so that he will not benefit from it, as was stated by Ibn Katheer and others. (End quote from Adwa’ Al-Bayan, 1/270).\nIt was narrated that Hakim ibn Hizam (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The two parties to a transaction have the option (of cancelling it) until they part. If they are honest and disclose any defects, their transaction will be blessed, but if they lie and conceal defects the blessing will be erased.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 2079 and Muslim, 1532)\n\n\nBarakah may be sought by giving thanks to Allah, may He be Exalted, for His blessings. Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n\n{And [remember] when your Lord proclaimed, ‘If you are grateful, I will surely increase you [in favour.]} [Ibrahim 14:7]\nGratitude may be expressed in one’s heart, in one’s words and in one’s actions.\nGratitude in the heart means acknowledging that these blessings are solely by the grace of Allah, may He be Exalted, and not turning in one’s heart to anyone other than Him, as the disbelieving people of the Jahiliyyah did by attributing blessings to someone other than the Creator, may He be glorified and Exalted, as Allah, may He be Exalted, describes them (interpretation of the meaning):\n{They recognize the favour of Allah; then they deny it. And most of them are disbelievers.} [An-Nahl 16:83]\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“They recognize the favour of Allah; then they deny it” means: they acknowledge that it is Allah, may He be Exalted, Who has granted this to them and bestowed it upon them, yet despite that they deny this fact and worship others alongside Him, and they attribute His help and provision to someone other than Him.” (End quote from Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 4/592)\nGratitude in one’s words means attributing these blessings to the Creator, may He be glorified and Exalted, praising Him, may He be Exalted, for these blessings, and not boasting of one’s smartness, intelligence, strength and so on, for all of these are blessings from Allah, may He be Exalted.\nExpressing gratitude in one’s actions means not using these blessings to do things that Allah, may He be Exalted, has forbidden.\nPart of expressing gratitude in one’s actions is showing kindness to others, as Allah, may He be Exalted, has shown kindness to you, for showing kindness to others is a way to attain more of Allah’s kindness. Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Is the reward for good [anything] but good?} [Ar-Rahman 55:60]\n\n\nFollowing Islamic etiquette when using any of these blessings, such as saying Bismillah Ar-Rahman Ar-Rahim (in the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful) when eating, drinking, entering the house, and so on.\n\n\nIt was narrated from Jabir ibn `Abdullah that he heard the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “When a man enters his house, and mentions Allah, when he enters and when he eats, the devil says: `You have no place to stay and no dinner.’ But if he enters and does not mention Allah when he enters, the devil says, `You have found a place to stay.’ And if he does not mention Allah when he eats, he says: `You have found a place to stay and dinner.’” (Narrated by Muslim, 2018)\nThat also includes eating together and not eating separately; not being wasteful with food and drink, and so on; and spending according to need, without being extravagant or miserly.\nAllah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And give the relative his right, and [also] the poor and the traveller, and do not spend wastefully. Indeed, the wasteful are brothers of the devils, and ever has Satan been to his Lord ungrateful. And if you [must] turn away from the needy awaiting mercy from your Lord which you expect, then speak to them a gentle word. And do not make your hand [as] chained to your neck or extend it completely and [thereby] become blamed and insolvent.} [Al-Isra’ 17:26-29]\nThe Muslim should be keen to follow the Sunnah of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and what he taught his Ummah of manners and etiquette when dealing with people, with one’s family and with one’s wealth.\nOne of the most beneficial books concerning this matter, and one of the easiest to understand is Riyadh As-Salihin by Imam An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him).\n\n\nProtecting oneself by means of the Du`as and Dhikrs narrated in the Sunnah.\n\n\nThe Muslim should regularly recite the Adhkar for the morning and the evening, the Adhkar before going to sleep, and all kinds of Adhkar as prescribed in Islamic teachings.\nOne of the most beneficial books for learning the Adhkar and Du`as prescribed in the Sunnah, by means of which the Muslim may protect himself, his family and his wealth, is Hisn Al-Muslim min Adhkar Al-Kitab was-Sunnah \xa0by Shaykh Sa`id ibn `Ali ibn Wahb Al-Qahtani. [Available in English under the title Fortress of the Muslim: Invocations from the Quran & Sunnah].\nTo sum up, the Muslim may seek Barakah by means of Taqwa (piety, fearing Allah), which means refraining from that which is forbidden and doing as much as he can of that which is enjoined, and by repenting and seeking forgiveness, and by following the example of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in all his affairs.\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 10083, 100105.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/266249/how-to-get-barakah-in-islam
