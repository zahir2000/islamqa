473749,"Hello. I would like to ask you, I am secretly Muslim and am hiding my faith from my Christian family. Is it regarded as disbelief (kufr) if I tell them “I am Christian”?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nWe congratulate you, our Muslim sister, for what Allah has honoured you with and blessed you with, and for His opening your heart to guidance and the religion of truth. This is the greatest blessing that has been bestowed upon you since your mother gave birth to you, so you should praise Allah greatly and ask your Lord to make you steadfast in adhering to guidance and the religion of truth so long as you remain in this world, and to grant you a good end, and thus grant you the best in both this world and the hereafter. We also give you the glad tidings that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) gave to anyone who believes in the religion of Islam and follows its Prophet, and was a believer in a previous Book, whether he was a Jew or a Christian.\nIt was narrated from Abu Musa al-Ash‘ari (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There are three who will be given a double reward: a man from among the people of the Book who believed in his Prophet, then lived to see the Prophet (S) and followed him and believed in him– he will have a double reward…”\nNarrated by al-Bukhari (3011) and Muslim (154).\nSecondly:\nUndoubtedly one of the greatest difficulties that the new Muslim may face is confronting his family and social circle who are following a religion other than Islam. This may be more difficult and more vicious in Arab countries and eastern countries in general, to the extent that it may lead to pressure to give up his religion and attempts to make him recant by any possible means. But these concerns about family opposition and social pressure should be analysed within a proper framework, which will help you to plan your next step and will help you to remain steadfast with strong resolve to persevere and do everything that is required of you.\nThis is akin to the traveller’s concerns about the risks of travel, and the troubles and difficulties he will face, but he has no choice but to start his journey. Therefore he takes appropriate measures, prepares his provisions and chooses his travel companion, then he sets out… Despite the fears, people still travel.\nAnd it is akin to the concerns of the sick person who is about to die, and faces surgeries and treatments in which there may be a great deal of pain and fear, but he has no choice but to bear that with patience, or else he is going to die.\nYour need to start your journey towards the Lord of the Worlds surpasses the need of all these people (travellers and sick people); it surpasses the need of one who is about to drown and die, then a lifebelt is thrown to him; it surpasses the need of the thirsty person for cool water on a hot day; it surpasses any need that any human could think of or imagine.\nThirdly:\nWhen we understand the pressure of the social environment, we will realise that this environment will, in many instances, force you to conceal your Islam and even make you pretend to others that you are still following their religion. So there is no blame on you if you tell them that you are a “Christian” and – in such cases – you will be regarded as one who had no choice and was compelled to do that. Allah, may He be exalted, says by way of giving a concession to His slaves (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Those who disbelieve in Allah after having believed – except one who is compelled while his heart remains steadfast in faith – and willingly open their hearts to disbelief, upon them will be the wrath of Allah, and theirs will be a grievous punishment}\xa0[Al-Nahl 16:106].\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Regarding the words {except one who is compelled while his heart remains steadfast in faith}, this is an exception from what is mentioned at the beginning of the verse, for the one who only utters words in order to go along with the polytheists verbally, under duress, because of what he has suffered of beatings and harm, but in his heart he rejects what he is saying and he remains steadfast in his belief in Allah and His Messenger.\nAl-‘Awfi narrated from Ibn ‘Abbas that this verse was revealed concerning ‘Ammar ibn Yasir, when the polytheists tortured him in order to make him disbelieve in Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and he went along with them in that unwillingly, \xa0because he was forced to do so. He came and apologised to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), then Allah revealed this verse. This was stated by al-Sha‘bi, Abu Malik and Qatadah.\nIbn Jarir said: Ibn ‘Abd al-A‘la told us: Muhammad ibn Thawr told us, from Ma‘mar, from ‘Abd al-Karim al-Jazari, from Abu ‘Ubaydah ibn Muhammad ibn ‘Ammar ibn Yasir, who said: The polytheists seized ‘Ammar ibn Yasir and tortured him until he gave them some of what they wanted. He complained about that to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “How do you find your heart?” He said: It is steadfast in faith. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If they do that again, then do the same thing again.”\nAl-Bayhaqi narrated a more detailed report, in which it says that he reviled the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and spoke well of their gods, and that he said: O Messenger of Allah, I was not left alone until I reviled you and spoke well of their gods. He said: \xa0“How do you find your heart?” He said: It is steadfast in faith. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If they do that again, then do the same thing again.” Concerning that, Allah revealed the words (interpretation of the meaning): {except one who is compelled while his heart remains steadfast in faith}.""(Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 4/605).\nThe best for you is to intend, every time you say that you are a “Christian”, that you are one of the followers of the Messiah ‘Isa ibn Maryam (Jesus son of Mary – peace be upon him), for the Messiah ‘Isa (peace be upon him) was a monotheist and a Muslim, and he did not bring the religion of the cross; he did not want the people to worship him instead of Allah.\nAllah may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{When Allah says: O ‘Isa son of Maryam, did you say to people: Take me and my mother as two gods besides Allah? He [‘Isa] will say: Glory be to You! It would not have been proper for me to say that which I had no right [to say]. If I had said it, You would surely have known it. You know all that I know, whereas I do not know what You know. Verily, You alone are the Knower of the unseen.\nI said nothing to them except that which You commanded me [to say]: Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord. I watched over them whilst I was amongst them, then when You took me up to You, You [alone] were the Watcher over them, and You are Witness over all things}\xa0[Al-Ma’idah 5:116-117].\nThe Messiah (peace be upon him) foretold the coming of the Prophet of Islam and his religion, and he took a covenant from his people that they would follow the Prophet of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nBut those among the Jews and Christians who associate others with Allah are the ones who concealed his prophecies and went against the covenant with him.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And [remember] when ‘Isaâ ibn Maryam said: O Children of Israel, verily I am the Messenger of Allah to you, confirming what came before me of the Torah, and bringing glad tidings of a Messenger to come after me, whose name will be Ahmad. But when he came to them with clear signs, they said: This is obviously magic!\nWho does greater wrong than he who fabricates lies against Allah when he is called to Islam? And Allah does not guide people who are given to wrongdoing.\nThey want to extinguish Allah’s light with their utterances, but Allah will perfect His light, even though the disbelievers hate it}\xa0[Al-Saff 61:6-9].\nWhatever the case, there is no blame on you if you say these words to your family or those from whom you fear trouble regarding your religion in your social circle. Our advice to you is to conceal your Islam from them, until Allah grants you a way out.\nPlease see also the answer to question no. 434525 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/473749/is-it-permissible-to-conceal-his-faith-and-say-that-he-is-a-christian
10447,"I checked the Holy Quran in regards to how to make a will. It's kind of complicated for me, that's why I am hoping you can help me Insha Allah.","['Praise be to Allah.What is a gift in Islam?\nThere is a difference between a will and a gift. Property that is willingly given away while one is alive is considered to be a gift, which does not come under the same rulings as a will. However, it should be noted that it is not permissible for a person to give a gift to some of his children and not others, or to favour some of them over others in gift-giving . Rather they must be treated fairly, because of the hadith of An-Nu`man ibn Bashir, who said that his father brought him to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), when he gave him a gift, to ask the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to bear witness to it. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked, “Have you given something similar to all your children?” He said, “No.” He said, “Then take it back.” Then he said: “Fear Allah and treat your children fairly.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, Al-Hibah, 2398)\xa0\nWhat is a will in Islam?\nWith regard to the will , it is a set of instructions on how (one’s property) is to be disposed of after one’s death, or how it is to be given away after one’s death.\xa0\nThe evidence that this (writing a will) is prescribed in Islam is found in the Quran and Sunnah, and the consensus of the scholars. Allah says (interpretation of the meanings):\xa0\n“It is prescribed for you, when death approaches any of you, if he leaves wealth, that he makes a bequest to parents and next of kin, according to reasonable manners. (This is) a duty upon the pious.” [Al-Baqarah 2:180]\xa0\n“(The distribution in all cases is) after the payment of legacies he may have bequeathed or debts.” [An-Nisa’ 4:11]\xa0\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah was being generous to you when He allowed you to give one-third of your wealth (in charity) when you die, to increase your good deeds.” (Narrated by Ibn Majah, Al-Wasaya, 2700; classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih Sunan Ibn Majah, no. 2190)\xa0\nThe scholars unanimously agreed that writing a will is permissible.\xa0\nHow to write a will in Islam\nWriting a will may be obligatory with regard to the dues\xa0 one owes to others where there is no proof, lest they be lost or neglected. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “It is not permissible for any Muslim who has something concerning which a will should be made to stay for two nights without having his last will written and kept ready with him.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, Al-Wasaya 2533)\nIt is recommended for a man to write a will that some of his wealth be used for charitable purposes , so that the reward for that may reach him after his death. So Allah granted permission for a person to dispose of one third of his wealth for that purpose when death approaches.\xa0\nIt is permitted to write a will concerning one third or less. Some of the scholars said it is preferable for it to be less than one-third, and the will does not apply to any of the heirs . The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No bequest is to be made to an heir.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, Al-Wasaya, 2047; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Sunan At-Tirmidhi, 1722). If the will is intended to harm the heirs or make things difficult for them, then that is prohibited, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“…so that no loss is caused (to anyone).” [An-Nisa’ 4:12]\xa0\nThe will comes into effect when the person dies. It is permissible for the person who writes the will to revoke it or cancel it or revoke part of it. Carrying out the will is an important matter which was confirmed by Allah and mentioned before other things, and there is a stern warning issued to those who change it.\xa0\nWith regard to the distribution of personal belongings, he does not have the right to state how they should be distributed after he dies , because the share of each heir has been defined by Allah, and He has explained who inherits and who does not inherit. So it is not permitted for any person to transgress the limits set by Allah, because Allah has warned against doing that. Allah says in Surat An-Nisa’ (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Allah commands you as regards your children’s (inheritance): to the male, a portion equal to that of two females; if (there are) only daughters, two or more, their share is two-thirds of the inheritance; if only one, her share is a half. For parents, a sixth share of inheritance to each if the deceased left children; if no children, and the parents are the (only) heirs, the mother has a third; if the deceased left brothers or (sisters), the mother has a sixth. (The distribution in all cases is) after the payment of legacies he may have bequeathed or debts. You know not which of them, whether your parents or your children, are nearest to you in benefit; (these fixed shares) are ordained by Allah. And Allah is Ever All-Knower, All-Wise.\nIn that which your wives leave, your share is a half if they have no child; but if they leave a child, you get a fourth of that which they leave after payment of legacies that they may have bequeathed or debts. In that which you leave, their (your wives) share is a fourth if you leave no child; but if you leave a child, they get an eighth of that which you leave after payment of legacies that you may have bequeathed or debts. If the man or woman whose inheritance is in question has left neither ascendants nor descendants, but has left a brother or a sister, each one of the two gets a sixth; but if more than two, they share in a third, after payment of legacies he (or she) may have bequeathed or debts, so that no loss is caused (to anyone). This is a Commandment from Allah; and Allah is Ever All-Knowing, Most-Forbearing.\nThese are the limits (set by) Allah (or ordainments as regards laws of inheritance), and whosoever obeys Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad) will be admitted to Gardens under which rivers flow (in Paradise), to abide therein, and that will be the great success.\nAnd whosoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad), and transgresses His limits, He will cast him into the Fire, to abide therein; and he shall have a disgraceful torment.” [An-Nisa’ 4:11-14]\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.\xa0\nFor more information, please see Al-Mulakhkhas Al-Fiqhi by Salih Al-Fawzan, 2/172-182\xa0\nThere is no reason why you should not give your nephews and nieces whatever you want of your wealth while you are alive. As they are not your own children, you are not obliged to give to them all equally. You can give gifts to those whom you love and to whomever you wish, or to whoever among them is according to his or her need. Try to give to those who are religiously committed in ways that will help them to obey Allah. It is also permitted to bequeath to them one-third or less of your wealth so long as they are not your heirs.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10447/how-to-write-a-will-in-islam
462582,Is it permissible to have the dua when entering toilet on a paper on the door of the bathroom?,"['Praise be to Allah.It is permissible to hang up adhkar for the purpose of reminding, but they should be hung up in appropriate places, so as to protect them from being mishandled or disrespected. So, for example, the dhikr for entering the lavatory should not be placed on the door of the bathroom; rather it should be placed beside the door on the outside, to the right or left of the entrance.\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\nIs it appropriate to put verses or adhkar of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on the walls in rooms for the purpose of reminding people of Allah, may He be exalted, and looking at them? Please advise us, may Allah reward you with good.\nHe replied:\nThe correct view is that there is nothing wrong with that, if it is for the purpose of reminding. There is nothing wrong with putting verses on the walls, or hadiths, for the purpose of reminding or benefitting others, such as hadiths about greeting with salaam or supplications (du‘a’s), or hadiths that remind people of what Allah has forbidden, or that encourage them to obey Allah, or Quranic verses. There is nothing wrong with putting such things on the walls in sitting rooms or offices. End quote from the shaykh’s website.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: As for writing hadiths [and hanging them up] at home, there is nothing wrong with writing a hadith in which there is some benefit, such as the expiation when leaving a gathering: “Subhanak Allahumma Rabbana wa bi hamdik, ashhadu an la ilaha illa anta, astaghfiruka wa atubu ilayk (Glory and praise be to You, O Allah our Lord.

8003,"I am usually out at school most of the day and I have to use the bathroom, I can't just go home to make Istinja’. Should I make Wudu and pray or should I miss the prayer and make it up later?","['Praise be to Allah.When a person relieves himself, he must cleanse himself of impurities either with water – which is best and most perfect – or with something other than water which will remove the impurities, such as toilet paper, fabric, stones or something else.\xa0\nIn Islam, How Does One Clean Himself After Using The Toilet?\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\nWhen a person relieves himself, he must do one of the following three things:\xa0\n\nPurify himself with water: This is permissible and the evidence for it is the\xa0Hadith of Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to relieve himself , then another boy and I would bring a vessel of water and a short spear [to use as a Sutrah for the prayer he was going to do after doing Wudu] and he would cleanse himself with the water.”\xa0 (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 149; Muslim, 271)\xa0\n\nThe reason for this is that the basic way of removing impurities is to use water. Just as you use water to remove any impurities from your foot, so too you use it to remove any impurities resulting from relieving yourself. \xa0\n\nPurify himself using stones: Doing Istijmar (using stones to cleanse oneself after relieving oneself) is sufficient. This is indicated by the words and actions of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). With regard to his words, Salman (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade us to use less than three stones for the purpose of Istijmar.”\xa0(Narrated by Muslim,\xa0 262)\xa0\n\nWith regard to his actions, Ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) went out to answer the call of nature and asked me to bring him three stones. I found two stones and searched for a third but could not find one. So I took a piece of dried dung and brought it to him. He took the two stones and threw away the dung and said, ‘This is a filthy thing.’”\xa0(Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 122)\xa0\nThe Hadith of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), which states that he gathered some stones for the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and brought them to him in his garment, put them down next to him, and then went away (narrated by Al-Bukhari, 154) indicates that Istijmar is permissible.\n\nPurify himself with stones then with water: I do not know of any report to this effect from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), but there is no doubt that this is more effective in cleaning.” (Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti’, 1/103-105)\xa0\n\nCan you miss prayer or delay it if you are unable to do Istinja’?\nBased on the above, you have no excuse for not praying or for delaying the prayer beyond the appointed time because you are unable to do Istinja’ (wash with water after relieving yourself), since you can remove the impurity and cleanse yourself of it using tissues and the like.\xa0\nEveryone can carry some tissues with him in his pocket to clean himself with. Moreover, it is not clear from the question what is stopping you from cleaning yourself with water after relieving yourself, especially since you say, “Should I make Wudu and pray or miss the prayer?”\xa0 What that means is that water is available, so you can bring some water to the toilet and use it to clean yourself. If you do not do that then you have to remove the impurity using tissues and the like, do Wudu, and then pray. It is not permissible for you to delay the prayer until its time has passed.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/8003/how-does-a-muslim-clean-himself-after-using-the-toilet
