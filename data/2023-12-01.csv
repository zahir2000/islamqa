288103,What is the meaning of Allah’s name al-‘Aziz (the Almighty)?,"['Praise be to Allah.Al-‘Aziz (the Almighty) is one of the beautiful names of Allah. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Verily, your Lord is the Strong, the Almighty [al-‘Aziz]}\xa0[Hud 11:66]\n{Verily, your Lord is the Almighty [al-‘Aziz], the Most Merciful }\xa0[Al-Shu‘ara’ 26:9]\n{No indeed [there are no such partners at all]! He is Allah [the only God], the Almighty [al-‘Aziz], the Most Wise}\xa0[Saba’ 34:27]\n{The sun is rapidly moving towards its destination. That is the decree of the Almighty [al-‘Aziz], All-Knowing}\xa0[Ya-Sin 36:38]\n{Who has created death and life, so that He may test you [and see] which of you is best in conduct, and He is the Almighty [al-‘Aziz], Oft-Forgiving}[Al-Mulk 67:2].\nIn linguistic terms, the word al-‘Aziz refers to one who is strong and powerful, who overcomes and cannot be overcome.\nAl-Zajjaj said: He is so powerful that nothing can overwhelm Him.\nSomeone else said: He is the Powerful, the One Who controls all things.""(Lisan al-‘Arab, 5/374).\nIbn al-Athir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nOne of the names of Allah, may He be exalted, is al-‘Aziz, Who is the Powerful one Who overcomes and none can overcome Him.\nThe root word ‘izzah refers to strength, might and control.""(Al-Nihayah\xa0 3/228).\nAl-Zubaydi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe word al-‘Aziz comes from the word al-‘izz, which refers to might and dominance. The king is called by this name because he dominates his subjects.""(Taj al-‘Arus\xa0 15/232).\nAl-‘izzah (might), which is one of the attributes of Allah, has three meanings:\n‘Izzah in the sense that no one can harm Him.\n‘Izzah in the sense of subduing and controlling others.\n‘Izzah in the sense of might and power.\nAll of these attributes belong to Allah, may He be exalted, in the most perfect and complete sense.\nShaykh Muhammad Khalil Harras (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his Sharh:\nAs for the name al-‘Aziz, it refers to the One who possesses the attribute of might, and the author mentioned three meanings for it:\n1. ‘Izzah in the sense that no one can harm Him, so none of His enemies who want to harm Him could do so. Hence their schemes will never reach Him and no one will be able to cause Him harm, as He says in the hadith qudsi: “O My slaves, you can never do Me any harm and you can never bring Me any benefit.” Narrated by Muslim (2577). So no one will ever be able to subdue Him or overcome Him.\n2. ‘Izzah in the sense of subduing and controlling others, meaning that He is the Subduer who controls others.\nSo He, may He be glorified, is the Subduer of His enemies, Who controls and overwhelms them, but they are not able to subdue Him or control Him.\nThis is the sense in which the word al-‘izzah is most often used.\n3. ‘Izzah in the sense of might and power.\nThese three meanings of ‘izzah may all be ascribed to Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, in the most perfect and complete way that is furthest removed from any shortcomings whatsoever.""(Sharh al-Qasidah al-Nuniyyah\xa0 2/79).\nShaykh al-Sa‘di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAl-‘Aziz means the One Who possesses all might: the might of power and strength, the might of control and overcoming, and the might that prevents anyone from harming Him.\nSo it is not possible that any of His creation could harm Him, for He subjugates all that exists and all creation submits to His might.\nThe three meanings of al-‘izzah are all perfect attributes of Allah:\nThe ‘izzah of strength is indicated by His names al-Qawiy al-Matin (the Lord of Might, the Powerful). This is a description of His great characteristics that cannot be compared to the strength of created beings, no matter how powerful they may be.\nThe ‘izzah when means that none can harm him indicates that no one could harm Him, for he is al-Ghaniy bi dhatihi (the Self-Sufficient), who does not need anyone and people cannot harm Him or benefit Him; rather He is the one who causes harm and brings benefit, the one who gives and the one who withholds.\nThe ‘izzah of subjugation and control of all beings. They are all subjugated to Allah, submit to His might and are controlled by His will. All forelocks are in His hand, and none of them can move or do anything except by His power, strength and permission. Whatever Allah wills happens and whatever He does not will does not happen, and there is no power and no strength except with Him.""(Tafsir Asma’ Allah al-Husna\xa0 p. 214).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/288103/the-meaning-of-allahs-name-al-aziz
21216,I want to know how the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to sleep. Did he sleep on a bed or on the floor? Did he used to recite a specific Du`a when he wanted to sleep?,"['Praise be to Allah.Did the Prophet sleep on the floor?\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to sleep sometimes on a mattress, sometimes on a leather mat, sometimes on a mat made of palm leaves, sometimes on the floor, sometimes on a bed, sometimes on the sand, and sometimes on a black cloak.\xa0\n`Abbad ibn Tamim (may Allah have mercy on him) said, narrating from his paternal uncles: I saw the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) lying on his back in the mosque, putting one leg on top of the other. (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 475; Muslim, 2100)\xa0\nHis mattress was made of leather stuffed with palm fibres, and he had a coarse woollen cloth that he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would fold over twice and sleep on.\xa0\nThe point is that he slept on a mattress and covered himself with a blanket. He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to his wives: “Jibril never came to me whilst I was under the blanket of any one of you apart from `Aishah.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 3775)\nHis pillow was also leather stuffed with palm fibres.\xa0\nDu`a before sleeping\nWhen he went to bed to sleep, he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would say : “Allahumma bismika ahya wa amut (O Allah, in Your name I live and die).” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 7394)\xa0\nHe (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to put his hands together and blow into them, then recite Qul Huwa Allahu ahad , Qul a’udhu bi Rabb il-Falaq and Qul a’udhu bi Rabb in-Nas [i.e., the last three surahs of the Quran), then he would wipe his hands over as much of his body as he could, starting with his head and face, and the front part of his body. He would do that three times.\xa0\nWhich side did the Prophet sleep on?\nHe (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to sleep on his right side , putting his right hand under his right cheek, then he would say: “Allahumma qini ‘adhabaka yawma tab’ath ‘ibadaka (O Allah, protect me from Your punishment on the Day You resurrect Your slaves).”\xa0\nWhen he went to bed he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to say: “Al-hamdu Lillah alladhi at’amana wa saqana wa kafana wa awana, fakam mimman la kaafi lahu wa la mu’wi (All praise is for Allah, Who fed us and gave us to drink, and Who is sufficient for us and has sheltered us, for how many have none to suffice them or shelter them).”\xa0\nThis was narrated by Muslim, who also narrated that he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to say when he went to bed:\xa0\n“Allahumma Rabb As-samawati wa’l-ard wa Rabb Al-‘arsh il-‘athim, Rabbana wa Rabba kulli shay’in, Faliq Al-habb wa’n-nawa wa munzil Al-Tawrati wa’l-Injili wa’l-Furqan, a’udhu bika min sharri kulli shay’in anta akhidhun bi nasiyatihi.

O Allah, You are the First so there is nothing before You, and You are the Last so there is nothing after You. You are Ath-Thaahir [the greatest and highest] so there is nothing above You, and You are Al-Baatin [aware of the subtlest secrets] so there is nothing closer than You. Settle our debt for us and spare us from poverty).” (Narrated by Muslim)\xa0\nDu`a after waking up\nWhen he woke up from sleep he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would say: “Al-hamdu Lillah alladhi ahyana ba’d ma amatana wa ilayhi Al-nushuor (Praise be to Allah Who has brought us back to life after causing us to die, and unto Him is the resurrection).” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 6312). Then he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would clean his teeth using the Miswak, and recite the last ten verses from Surat Al ‘Imran, from the verse (interpretation of the meaning): \xa0\n“Verily, in the creation of the heavens and the earth…”\xa0[Aal ‘Imran 3:190-200]\nHe (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would also say: “Allahumma laka Al-hamd anta nur As-samawaati wa’l-ard wa man fihinna, wa laka Al-hamd anta qayyum us-samawati wa’l-ard wa man fihinna, wa laka Al-hamd anta Al-haqq wa wa’duka Al-haqq wa liqa’uka haqq wa’l-jannatu haqq wa’n-naru haqq wa’n-nabiyuna haqq wa Muhammadun haqq wa’s-sa’atu haqq.

You are my God and there is no god worthy of worship but You).” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 1120)\xa0\nProphet Muhammad’s sleep routine\nHe (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to sleep during the first part of the night and get up to pray during the last part. Sometimes he would stay up late to deal with the interests of the Muslims. His eyes slept but his heart did not. When he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) slept, they (his family) would not wake him up; he would be the one to wake up.\nWhen he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stopped to rest at night during a journey, he would lie down on his right side, and if he stopped to rest just before dawn he would prop his head up on his forearm, resting it in his palm. This was narrated by At-Tirmidhi.\xa0\nHow many hours did the Prophet sleep?\nProphet Muhammad’s sleep \xa0(peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was of the best length and it was the most beneficial of sleep. The doctors say that it is one-third of the night and day, namely eight hours.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21216/how-did-prophet-muhammad-sleep
161563,"I see many young men, even my friends, wearing strings around their necks, to which is usually attached pictures of the martyrs, or slogans about Palestine or al-Aqsa… What is the ruling on wearing such things, for men, with or without images or pictures?","['Praise be to Allah.These strings that are worn around the neck are either one of two things:\n1. Either they have images of living beings, so it is not permissible to wear them, either for men or for women. Please see the answer to question no. 7222 for more information on the ruling on images.\n2. Or they are free of images. If they are only worn by women, and there is nothing in then that is contrary to Islamic rulings, then there is nothing wrong with them.\nBut if they are for men, as the questioner mentioned, then it is not permissible for them to wear it, because wearing necklaces is something that is only for women, so wearing them is imitating women, and hardly anyone wears them in the manner in which women usually wear them except effeminate men (al-mukhannathun) – we seek refuge with Allah.\nIt is proven in the hadith of Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) cursed men who imitate women and women who imitate men. Narrated by al-Bukhari (5885).\nShaykh Muhammad ibn Salih al-‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about the ruling on men wearing chains, and he replied:\nWearing chains as adornment is haram [for men], because that is something that is only for women, and he is imitating women. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) cursed men who imitate women, and the prohibition and sin is exacerbated if it is made of gold, in which case it becomes haram for men on two counts, because it is gold and because it is imitating women. It becomes even more abhorrent if it contains an image of an animal or an angel, and even worse and more abhorrent than that is if it contains a cross. This is haram even for a woman, if she wears jewellery in which there is an image, whether it is an image of a human or an animal, a bird or not a bird, or if it contains the image of a cross. This – I mean wearing anything in which there is an image – is haram for both men and women, so it is not permissible for either of them to wear anything that contains the image of an animate being or the image of a cross. And Allah knows best.""(Majmu‘ Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymin\xa0 11/97).\nWith regard to these pendants, even if we assume that the men do not intend to adorn themselves with them, it is still not free from imitating women in wearing necklaces, and resembling immoral and effeminate men in their actions and adornment. So it is more appropriate to tell men not to wear them at all, and instead of that they can wear these slogans without putting them on necklaces.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/161563/ruling-on-wearing-a-string-around-the-neck-for-men
10373,My father passed away recently whilst on Hajj.,"['Praise be to Allah.Carrying the deceased and following the funeral\nIt is obligatory to carry the deceased and follow the funeral. This is one of the rights that the dead Muslim has over the Muslims, which will bring great reward and virtue to the one who does it.\xa0\nThe Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever attends the funeral from the house (of the deceased) [according to one report: whoever follows the funeral of a Muslim out of faith and the hope of reward] until the funeral prayer is offered will have one Qirat, and whoever attends the funeral until the deceased is buried will have two Qirats.” He was asked, “O Messenger of Allah, what are the two Qirats?” He said, “Like two huge mountains.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, Al-Jana’iz, 1240).\nIt is not permitted to follow funerals in manners that go against the Shari`ah. That includes:\n\nCrying or weeping in a loud voice;\xa0\nFollowing it with incense (Bukhur) etc.;\xa0\nReciting Dhikr in a loud voice in front of the coffin as it is being carried, because that is Bid’ah. Qays ibn `Abbad (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to regard it as disliked to raise the voice in front of the coffin” – and because it is an imitation of the Christians.\xa0\n\nHow to bury the deceased in Islam\nMuslims should not be buried with the disbelievers, nor the disbelievers with Muslims. The Muslim should be buried in the Muslim graveyard. \xa0\nThe Sunnah is to put the deceased into the grave from the end, then he should be turned onto his right side in the grave, with his face directed towards the Qiblah . The one who puts him into the Lahd  should say, “Bismillahi wa ‘ala sunnat Rasul-Allahi or ‘ala millat Rasul-Allahi (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) (In the name of Allah and according to the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah or according to the religion of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)).” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, Al-Jana’iz 967; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Sunan Abu Dawud, 836)\xa0\nIt is recommended for those who are at the grave to throw handfuls of earth, three handfuls scooped up in both hands, after the Lahd has been sealed.\nWhat to do after the burial?\nAfter the burial is complete, there are several things which are Sunnah:\xa0\n\nTo make the grave a little higher than the ground, approximately a handspan, and not to make it level with the ground, so that it may be distinguished as a grave and respected, and not subjected to disrespect. It should be made approximately a handspan higher than the ground, and there is nothing wrong with placing a marker such as a stone or something similar, so that others of his family may be buried near him later on. Water should be sprinkled on the grave so that the soil will settle and not fly around.\nNo one should stand by the grave telling the deceased that he will be questioned soon etc., as is the custom among some people.\nRather people should stand at the grave and pray for the deceased to be made steadfast and for forgiveness for him. Those who are present should be told to do this, because of the Hadith of `Uthman ibn `Affan (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: “When the deceased had been buried, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would stand by (the grave) and say: ‘Pray for forgiveness for your brother and ask for him to be made steadfast, for even now he is being questioned .’” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, Al-Jana’iz, 2804; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Sunan Abu Dawood, 2758)\xa0\nNothing of the Quran should be recited at the graveside, because this is Bid`ah. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not do this, and neither did his noble Companions.\xa0\nIt is prohibited to build up graves or to plaster them or to write anything on them, because Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade us to plaster graves with gypsum, to sit on them or to build anything over them.” (Narrated by Muslim, Al-Jana’iz, 1610. According to Abu Dawud,\xa0 “He forbade us\xa0 to plaster graves with gypsum, to write on them or to step on them.” (Al-Jana’iz, 3226. Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Sunan Abu Dawud, 2763)\xa0\n\nHow to offer condolences in Islam\nIt is prescribed in Islam to offer condolences to the family of the deceased. This should take the form of whatever is thought will bring them consolation, stem their grief and help them to be patient.\xa0\nCondolences should be offered in the manner reported from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) if one can remember that, otherwise use good words that come naturally which achieve the same purpose and align with Islamic principles.\xa0\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “To Allah belongs that which He has taken and that which He gives, and with Him everything has an appointed end, so be patient and seek reward.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, Al-Jana’iz, 1204)\xa0\nWhat to avoid when offering condolences?\nTwo things must be avoided:\n\nGathering to offer condolences, even though the people do that.\nThe family of the deceased preparing food to offer to those who come to offer condolences.\n\nThe Sunnah is for the relatives and neighbours of the deceased to make food enough for the bereaved family.\xa0\nReferences:\n\nAhkam Al-Jana’iz by Al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him).\nAl-Mulakhkhas Al-Fiqhi by Al-Fawzan (213-216).\n\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10373/how-to-bury-the-deceased
