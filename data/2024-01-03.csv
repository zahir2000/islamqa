These may be problems that existed before the purchase, such as:","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nInsurance is of two types:\nCommercial insurance, where the aim of the one who buys insurance is to get money, and the aim of the insurance company is to make a profit. This is what is usually the case with insurance as it exists at present.\nThis type of insurance is haram, because it is based on ambiguity, riba (interest or usury) and gambling.\nThe second type of insurance is cooperative insurance, which is based on donations and cooperation between the participants, and it is not aimed at making a profit. This type of insurance is permissible.\nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 8889 .\nWe have not come across the type of title insurance mentioned or what it involves, so that we could give a ruling concerning it.\nHowever, in general terms we may say that if the title insurance referred to in the question is a type of commercial insurance, then it is not permissible to participate in it, unless the system forces people to do that, in which case there is no blame on the Muslim if he participates in it, because he is compelled to do so, and the sin will be borne by those who compelled him to do that.\nSecondly:\nThe fact that haram insurance may serve some interests and offer some benefits to those who participate in it does not mean that it becomes halal, because the things that are prohibited are usually not without some benefits, but the corruption and harms that result from them are much greater.\nWith regard to alcohol itself, which is the mother of all evils and is prohibited in the systems of law of all the prophets, Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{They ask you about wine and gambling. Say, ""In them is great sin and [yet, some] benefit for people. But their sin is greater than their benefit}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:219].\nThus Allah, may He be exalted, affirms that they have some benefits, but He, may He be glorified and exalted, prohibited them because the harm they cause is much greater than any benefits they may bring.\nIt is possible to avoid the problems referred to in the question – namely unpaid taxes, fraud and so on – by checking before buying, and taking the necessary precautions.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/396695/ruling-on-title-insurance-to-protect-the-buyers-rights
225165,What are the most important rulings on shares of inheritance?,"['Praise be to Allah.Importance of knowledge of Islamic law of inheritance\nKnowledge of\xa0Al-fara’id\xa0(allocated shares of inheritance) is one of the most important branches of Islamic knowledge. In three verses of Surah An-Nisa’, Allah, may He be Exalted, states many of the rulings thereon, then the Prophet’s Sunnah explains these rulings in detail.\nThe Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) paid attention to the knowledge of shares of inheritance, as did the Tabi`in (the generation who came after the Companions) and the scholars who came after them, and many books were written about this branch of knowledge.\nWe will mention below some of the main guidelines on this branch of knowledge:\nComponents of inheritance in Islam\nThe essential components of inheritance are:\xa0\n\nthe heir,\xa0\nthe testator (that is, the deceased),\nand what is to be inherited (the estate).\n\nConditions of inheritance in Islam\nThe conditions of inheritance are three:\n\nAscertaining that the heir is alive at the time of the testator’s death, or that he is to be regarded as being effectively among the living, such as a foetus in utero. The foetus may inherit subject to conditions: Firstly establishing that he was in the womb at the time of the testator’s death, even as a\xa0 Nutfah\xa0(fertilised egg); and, secondly, establishing that he was born alive and in stable condition.\nAscertaining that the testator has died, or that he is to be regarded as being effectively among the dead, such as one who is missing.\nKnowing who may inherit, the reason why he is entitled to inherit, his connection to the testator and how close that connection is, and so on.\n\nCauses of entitlement to inheritance\nThe causes of entitlement to inheritance are three:\xa0\n\nNikah (meaning a valid marriage contract only; it is not stipulated that the marriage should have been consummated);\xa0\nWala’ (manumission of a slave);\xa0\nAnd Nasab (blood ties).\n\nImpediments to inheritance\n\nThe impediments to inheritance are three:\xa0\n\n\nenslavement (a slave cannot inherit anything);\xa0\nmurder (the killer cannot inherit anything from the one whom he killed);\xa0\nand difference of religion (a disbeliever cannot inherit from a Muslim and a Muslim cannot inherit from a disbeliever).\n\nCategories of heirs among men\nThere are fifteen categories of heirs among men: the son; the son’s son , no matter how far the line of descent reaches; the father; the paternal grandfather, no matter how far the line of ascent reaches through the male line only; the full brother ; the half-brother through the father; the half-brother through the mother; the son of a full brother; the son of a half-brother through the father, no matter how far the line of descent reaches; the paternal “full-uncle” (full brother of the father); the paternal “half-uncle” (the half-brother of the father through their father), no matter how far the line of ascent reaches; the son of the paternal “full-uncle” (full brother of the father), the son of the paternal “half-uncle” (the half-brother of the father through their father) no matter how far the line of descent reaches; the husband ; and the freed male slave.\nCategories of heirs among women\nThere are ten categories of heirs among women: the daughter ; the son’s daughter, no matter how far her father’s line of descent reaches; the mother ; the maternal grandmother; the paternal grandmother; the full sister; the half-sister through the father; the half-sister through the mother; the wife; and the freed female slave.\nTypes of inheritance in Islam\nInheritance is of two types: Fard (pl. Fara’id – allocated shares) and Ta`sib (residual inheritance).\n\nFard refers to the shares that are allocated to heirs in accordance with the religious texts, such as one half, one quarter, one third, and so on.\nTa`sib refers to what an heir may receive from what is left (the residue) of the estate after those who are entitled to allocated shares have received their shares.\n\nWhat are the allocated shares of inheritance?\nThe allocated shares that are mentioned in the Book of Allah, may He be Exalted, are six: one half, one quarter, one eighth, two thirds, one third and one sixth.\nFirst of all, those who are entitled to allocated shares take their shares. Then if anything is left of the estate, it is taken by the residual heirs. If there is nothing left for them, then they have no share, in accordance with the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “Give the shares of inheritance to those who are entitled to them, and whatever is left goes to the closest male relatives.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 6732 and Muslim, 1615)\nBooks on inheritance on Islam\nAs for the details on the rulings of inheritance, and discussing the case of each heir and the conditions of his inheritance, in all circumstances, that requires detailed discussion for which there is no room here. Please refer to the books that have been written on this topic, the easiest of which include:\n\nAl-Fawa’id Al-Jaliyyah fi’l-Mabaahith Al-Fardiyyah\xa0by Shaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him)\nTas-hil Al-Fara’id\xa0by\xa0 Shaykh Muhammad ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him)\nAt-Tahqiqat Al-Mardiyyah fi’l-Mabahith Al-Fardiyyah\xa0by Shaykh Salih Al-Fawzan (may Allah preserve him).\n\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/225165/rules-of-inheritance-in-islam
396699,"Do the family of a potential wife have the right to ask the suitor, at the time of proposal, about his salary and exactly how much he earns?","['Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with the guardian of the woman asking about the salary of the suitor and his level of income, because the guardian is acting in the interests of the woman, and one of her interests is that she should marry a man who can afford to spend on her.\nIt was narrated from ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Each of you is in a position of responsibility and each of you is answerable for those under his care. The ruler of the people is in a position of responsibility and is answerable for those under his care. A man is in a position of responsibility over his household and is answerable for those under his care.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (2554) and Muslim (1829).\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) indicates that guardianship is a trust, the requirements of which must be fulfilled… The Muslims are unanimously agreed on what this means: the one who is a guardian of an orphan, the one who is the trustee of a waqf (endowment) and the one who is appointed to look after another person’s property and act as his proxy, must do what is in the best interests, then the next best interests, of that which is under his care, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And do not approach the orphan\'s property except in a way that is best\xa0…” [al-An‘am 6:152}, and He did not say “except in a good way.”""(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa\xa0 28/250-251).\nThe Sunnah indicates that it is permissible for a man to marry a woman for her wealth, and by the same token it is permissible for a woman to marry a man for his wealth, even though the foremost concern should be the level of religious commitment of the other partner.\nIt was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah have mercy on him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “A woman may be married for four things: her wealth, her lineage, her beauty and her religious commitment. Choose the one who is religiously-committed, may your hands be rubbed with dust (i.e., may you prosper).”\xa0 Narrated by al-Bukhari (5090) and Muslim (1466).\nAbu’l-‘Abbas al-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe words “A woman may be married for four things: her wealth, her lineage, her beauty and her religious commitment” mean: These are four characteristics that encourage a man to marry a woman, and they are what men seek in women. This is describing what happens in real life; it is not a command to look for these things. What appears to be the case is that it is permissible to marry a woman who has all of these characteristics, or one of them. However, seeking one who is religiously committed is best and most important, hence he said: “Choose the one who is religiously-committed, may your hands be rubbed with dust (i.e., may you prosper).”""(Al-Mufhim\xa0\xa04/215).\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nMoreover, if one of the two partners stipulates a particular characteristic in the other – such as wealth, beauty, virginity and the like – that is valid, and the one who stipulates that has the right to nullify the marriage if that condition is not met, according to the more sound of the two reports from Ahmad, the more sound of the two views of the companions of al-Shafa‘i, and what appears to be the view of Malik…""(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa\xa0 29/175).\nIt is proven that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) suggested to Fatimah bint Qays that she should reject the proposal of Mu‘awiyah ibn Abi Sufyan, when he proposed marriage to her, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) gave as the reason for that: “he is poor and has no wealth.” Narrated by Muslim (1480).\nAll of this evidence indicates that it is permissible for the guardian to ask this question, and there is nothing wrong with that, but it should be done with wisdom, because many people think that the details of a person’s salary is a private matter, and they do not like to talk about it in detail, for fear that the marriage may not take place.

145160,"I wanted to know how many times can a person eat during the whole day. In the Quran it reads “O Children of Adam! Take your adornment to every Masjid, and eat and drink, but waste not by extravagance, certainly He (Allah) likes not the wasteful” [7:31].","['Praise be to Allah.What does Islam say about extravagance?\nExtravagance is blameworthy in eating and other things. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And eat and drink but waste not by extravagance, certainly He (Allâh) likes not Al-Musrifûn (those who waste by extravagance).” [Al-A`raf 7:31]\xa0\n“And waste not by extravagance. Verily, He likes not Al-Musrifûn (those who waste by extravagance).” [Al-An`am 6:141]\xa0\n“And let not your hand be tied (like a miser) to your neck, nor stretch it forth to its utmost reach (like a spendthrift), so that you become blameworthy and in severe poverty.” [Al-Isra’ 17:29]\xa0\n“And give to the kinsman his due and to the Miskîn (poor) and to the wayfarer. But spend not wastefully (your wealth) in the manner of a spendthrift. Verily, spendthrifts are brothers of the devils, and the satan is ever ungrateful to his Lord.” [Al-Isra’ 17:26-27]\xa0\nThe difference between extravagance and wasteful spending is that extravagance means spending on something appropriate in an excessive manner, whereas wasteful spending means spending on something that is not appropriate. This was stated by Al-Munawi in Fayd Al-Qadir, 1/50\nIs overeating prohibited in Islam?\nExtravagance leads to overstepping the mark, which means eating beyond the point of fullness. This is not limited to one or two or three meals a day . A person may eat one meal a day and eat extravagantly during that meal. Or he may eat three meals without being extravagant.\xa0\nThe Hadith of Al-Miqdad (may Allah be pleased with him) encourages eating small amounts of food and being content with that which is enough to keep one going. It does not suggest the number of meals. These few mouthfuls may be eaten at three times, at breakfast, lunch and dinner, and he will be eating little in these meals. If he wants to eat more than a few mouthfuls – in his meal – he should leave one third (of his stomach) for his food, one third for his drink, and one third for air. If he needs another meal – as is the case for most people – there is nothing wrong with that, but he should pay attention to the same points noted above. The same applies if he needs to have three or four meals. The number of meals varies from one person to another, the type of food and the effort necessary to prepare it.\xa0\nWhat matters is taking care of the body and not causing any harm, whether by overeating or starving.\xa0\nWhat also matters is eating to have strength to carry out acts of worship, which is achieved by eating moderate amounts, not by eating heavy amounts or going too hungry.\xa0\nIt says in Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah (25/332):\xa0\n“Part of the etiquette of eating is to be moderate in eating and not to fill the stomach. The most that is acceptable in this regard is for the Muslim to divide his stomach into three parts: one third for food, one third for drink and one third for air, because of the Hadith: “The son of Adam does not fill any vessel worse than his stomach. It is enough for the son of Adam to eat a few mouthfuls to keep him going, but if he must (fill his stomach), then one third for his food, one third for his drink and one third for air.” That will lead to a lean and light body, because eating one’s fill leads to heaviness, which makes one too lazy to do acts of worship and strive. When we say one third of the stomach, it means limiting oneself to one third of what one would have to eat one’s fill, and it was said that this may be done by limiting it to one half of a Mudd. But Al-Nafrawi favoured the former view, because of differences among people. All of this applies to one who will not become weak as a result of eating less than his fill, otherwise it is better for him to eat that which will give him energy to worship and will be physically appropriate for him.``\nCategories of eating in Islam\nIn Al-Fatawa Al-Hindiyyah it says: Eating falls into different categories:\xa0\nObligatory – which is what will ward off death. If a person stops eating and drinking until he dies, then he has committed a sin.\nThat which is rewarded – which is what will give him more energy so that he is able to pray standing up and makes it easy for him to fast.\nPermissible – which is more than that, to the point of eating one’s fill, so that he will have more physical strength. There is no reward for this and it is not regarded as sinful. He will be brought to account for it but the reckoning will be light if the food was permissible.\nProhibited – this refers to eating more than one’s fill unless the intention is to have the strength to fast the following day or so as not to embarrass a guest, in which case there is nothing wrong with eating more than one’s fill.\xa0\nIbn Al-Hajj (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Eating in and of itself falls into different categories: obligatory, recommended, permissible, disliked and forbidden.\nThat which is obligatory is that which will keep him going so that he can fulfil his obligatory duties towards his Lord, because that which is essential to doing something obligatory is also obligatory.\nThat which is recommended is that which will help him to do optional acts of worship, acquire knowledge and do other acts of obedience.\nThat which is permissible is that which enables one to fill one’s stomach in the manner prescribed in Shari`ah.\nThat which is disliked is that which is a little more than is enough to fill the stomach but does not harm one.\nThat which is forbidden is eating a great deal that is harmful to the body.\xa0\nAl-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is disliked to eat more permissible food than is enough to satisfy one.\xa0\nThe Hanbalis said: “It is permissible to eat a great deal so long as it does not harm one. In Al-Ghuniyah it says: It is disliked when there is the fear of indigestion. It was narrated from Ibn Taymiyah that it is disliked to eat that which leads to indigestion; it was also narrated from him that doing this is prohibited.” \xa0\nWhat is extravagance in eating?\xa0\nFrom the above it is clear that there is nothing wrong with eating more than one meal a day and that, on its own, it is not regarded as extravagance; rather extravagance is eating more than is enough to fill one’s stomach even if that is in one meal.\xa0\nAmong the evidence that it is permissible to eat enough to fill one’s stomach and that what is disliked or prohibited is going beyond that limit is the report narrated by Al-Bukhari (5381) and Muslim (2040) from Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: Abu Talhah said to Umm Sulaym: I have heard the voice of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) sounding weak, and I know that he is hungry. Do you have anything? … This is a story of food being increased in quantity by virtue of the supplication of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), in which he said: “Give permission for ten to enter.” He gave them permission and they ate until they were full, then they left. Then he said: “Give permission for ten to enter.” He gave them permission and they ate until they were full, then they left. Then he said: “Give permission for ten to enter.” He gave them permission and they ate until they were full, then they left. Then he gave permission to ten more to enter, and all the people ate, and ate their fill, and there were eighty men.\xa0\nAl-Bukhari\xa0 (may Allah have mercy on him) included this report in a chapter entitled: Chapter on one who eats his fill.\xa0\nIn this chapter he also narrated that `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) died when we had eaten our fill of the two black ones: dates and water.\xa0\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Ibn Battal said: From these Hadiths we see that it is permissible to eat one’s fill, although not doing so sometimes is preferable. … At-Tabari said: But eating one’s fill, even though it is permissible, has its limits, and anything beyond that is extravagance. That which is permissible of it is that which helps the eater to obey his Lord and its heaviness does not distract him from doing what is enjoined upon him. Al-Qurtubi said in Al-Mufhim, after mentioning the story of Abu Al-Haytham, when he slaughtered a sheep for the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his two Companions and they ate until they were full: In (this report) there is evidence that it is permissible to eat one’s fill, and the reports which say that it is not allowed are to be understood as referring to fullness that weighs heavily in the stomach and makes a person slow to do acts of worship, and leads to feeling sleepy and lazy. Though it is disliked, it may go so far as being prohibited according to the negative consequences that result from it.” (Fath Al-Bari)\xa0\nThe way you described your breakfast, lunch and dinner is not regarded as extravagance; rather they may be small, compared to what people are used to. But you know yourself best and what is best suited to your body’s needs.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/145160/is-overeating-prohibited
