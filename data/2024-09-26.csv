147025,"There is an old woman who is blind and can only move with great difficulty, and the toilet is outside the house, relatively far away. Because it is difficult for her to go there during the night, her daughter-in-law puts diapers on her at night that she does not take off until the morning, because she is not able to put them on and take them off by herself. She is asking about the prayers that become due when she is wearing the diaper, and she may have urinated or defecated, so there is impurity (najasah) in them. Is her prayer valid when she is wearing the diaper?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIn order for prayer to be valid, it is stipulated that the clothes and body, and the place in which one is praying, must be pure (tahir), and it is not permissible for the worshipper to pray when he is wearing a garment that is contaminated with impurity.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {And your clothing purify} [al-Muddaththir 74:4].\nAbu Dawud (650) narrated that Abu Sa`id al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Whilst the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was leading his companions in prayer, he took off his sandals and placed them on his left. When the people saw that, they took off their sandals too. When the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) finished his prayer, he said: “What made you take off your sandals?” They said: We saw you take off your sandals, so we took off our sandals too. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Jibril (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came to me and told me that there was some dirt (impurity) on them.” And he said: “When one of you comes to the mosque, let him check and if he sees any dirt or filth (impurity) on his sandals, let him wipe them and pray in them.” Al-Albani classed it as authentic in Sahih Abi Daud.\nIt says in Zad al-Mustaqni`: Whoever carries impurity on him that cannot be overlooked, or finds it on his garment or his body, his prayer is not valid.\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his commentary: “Whoever carries impurity on him that cannot be overlooked”: from the words “that cannot be overlooked” we may understand that some impurities may be overlooked, and that is indeed so. The author stated previously that a small amount of blood may be overlooked, if it comes from a pure (tahir) living being, such as a human for example, or the blood of a sheep, camel and the like. He also stated previously that Shaykh al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyah – may Allah have mercy on him] thought that a small amount of all impurities may be overlooked, especially if it is difficult to avoid them, as in the case of those who own donkeys and rides them a great deal, for whom it is not possible to avoid drops of the donkey’s urine sometimes, if not most of the time. Thus Shaykh al-Islam thought that the reason (for overlooking it) is the difficulty in avoiding it, so whenever it is too difficult avoid the impurity, a small amount of it may be overlooked. The same may be said in the case of painters, that a small amount of paint may be overlooked if it gets onto their bodies and prevents water from reaching their skin [when doing wudu’], because religion is easy, and such things often happen to a person without him realising sometimes, or he realises but it is difficult for him to avoid it.\nSo with regard to carrying impurity, if it contaminates a person’s garment, then in fact he is carrying it, because he is wearing a garment that is impure (najis). If he puts the impurity in a bottle in his pocket, then he is carrying impurity that cannot be overlooked. This sometimes happens nowadays, when if a person wants to test his stools or urine, he puts it in a bottle and may be carrying it [in his pocket] when he is praying. This prayer is not valid, because he is carrying impurity that cannot be overlooked. End quote from ash-Sharh al-Mumti` (2/22).\nSo if someone prays wearing a diaper in which there is some impurity, and he knows that the impurity is there and remembers it, his prayer is not valid, unless he is incontinent. Regarding matters related to incontinence, please see the answers to questions no. 106751 and 126293.\nSecondly:\nThe individual must purify himself from impurities, as mentioned above. If he cannot do that, and he can afford it, he must hire someone to cleanse himself, because what is essential to doing an obligatory action is also obligatory. If he cannot afford to hire someone, because he is not well off or there is no one who can do that, then he must pray as he is, for Allah does not place on any soul a burden greater than it can bear.\nIt says in Kashshaf al-Qina` (1/102): If an amputee or someone in a similar situation, such as one who is paralyzed or sick and unable to do wudu’ by himself, can find someone to help him do wudu’ or ghusl in return for payment at the normal rate, and he is able to afford that without causing hardship to himself or to those on whose maintenance he is obliged to spend, then he must do that, because he comes under the same heading as one who is healthy. If he can find someone to help him do tayammum but is not able to find someone to help him do wudu’ or ghusl, then he must do that, as in the case of a healthy person who is able to do tayammum but not wudu’. If he cannot find anyone to help him do either wudu’ or tayammum, and he cannot afford to hire someone or cannot find someone to hire, then he must pray as he is. It says in al-Mughni: I do not know of any difference of opinion regarding that. Similarly, if he cannot find anyone except by paying more than the usual fee, unless the increase [for helping him to do wudu’ or ghusl] rather than tayammum is small, then he should pray as he is, and he does not have to repeat his prayer, as in the case of one who has neither of the means of purifying himself [that is, water for wudu’ or dust for tayammum]. What is mentioned above regarding wudu’ also applies in the case of cleaning oneself after relieving oneself (istinja’). If someone volunteers to help him purify himself, then he must accept that. It says in al-Furu`: Rather he does not have to do that [accept such help], and he may do tayammum instead. (End quote)\nThirdly:\nThe woman asked about here must do one of two things:\nFirstly: doing without the diapers, by placing a vessel or the like near her in which she can relieve herself and clean herself with water or even with tissues and the like;\nSecondly: taking off the diaper and cleansing herself from impurity before praying.\nIf neither option is possible, even by hiring someone to empty the vessel or change the diaper, and no one volunteers to do that, she may pray with the impurity, and she is excused.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/147025/is-her-prayer-valid-when-she-is-wearing-a-diaper-in-which-there-is-impurity-najasah
197937,What is the evidence from the Quran and Sunnah that scholarly consensus (ijma`) may be used as evidence when working out Islamic rulings?,"['Praise be to Allah.Sound scholarly consensus (ijma`) is one of the sources of Islamic legislation. So when it is proven that there is scholarly consensus, that constitutes binding shar`i proof and no one has the right to go against it.\nPlease see the answers to questions no. 112268 and 131935.\nThe fact that scholarly consensus (ijma`) may be used as evidence is supported by many texts of the Quran and Sunnah.\nEvidence from the Holy Quran:\n\n{But whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him, and follows a path other than that of the believers, We will leave him to that which he himself has chosen and cast him into hell – an evil journey’s end} [an-Nisa’ 4:115].\n\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe evidence on which ash-Shafa`i based his argument to support his view that consensus constitutes definitive proof that it is prohibited to go against is this verse, and he reached this conclusion after lengthy deliberation and thought. This is the best and strongest conclusions regarding this issue. (End quote from Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 2/413)\nThe conclusion reached from the verse is based on the fact that Allah, may He be exalted, issued a warning of punishment to those who follow a path other than that of the believers. This indicates that it is obligatory to follow the path of the believers, which is what the believers unanimously agree upon.\n\n{Thus We have made of you an Ummah [nation, community] justly balanced, that you might be witnesses over humankind, and the Messenger might be a witness over you } [al-Baqarah 2:143].\n\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: What is meant by al-wasat [translated here as justly balanced] is what is fair and best. Allah has made them witnesses over humankind and has made their testimony equal to the testimony of the Messenger. It is soundly narrated in as-Sahih that a funeral passed by the Messenger of Allah (S) and the people spoke well of the deceased, so he said: “It has become certain, it has become certain.” Then another funeral passed by him and they spoke ill of the deceased, so he said: “It has become certain, it has become certain.” They said: O Messenger of Allah, why did you say,It has become certain, it has become certain? He said: “For the one of whom you spoke well, I said: Paradise has become certain for him, and for the one of whom you spoke ill, I said: Hell has become certain for him. You are the witnesses of Allah on earth.”\nAs Allah has made them witnesses, they cannot give false testimony. If they testify that Allah has enjoined something, then He must have enjoined it, and if they testify that Allah has forbidden something, then He must have forbidden it. If they were capable of giving false or wrong testimony, they would not be the witnesses of Allah on earth. Rather Allah has praised them and their testimony as He praised the prophets for what they conveyed from Him, by confirming that they (the prophets) would not say anything about Him except what is true, and thus the ummah will not say in testimony regarding what Allah has permitted and prohibited anything except what is true. Moreover, Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {and follow the way of those who turn to Me} [Luqman 31:15]. The ummah constantly turns to Allah, so it is obligatory to follow their path. (End quote from Majmu` al-Fatawa, 19/177-178)\n\n{If you are in dispute over any matter, refer it to Allah and His Messenger, if you [truly] believe in Allah and the Last Day} [an-Nisa’ 4:59].\n\nThe words {If you are in dispute over any matter, refer it} indicate that with regard to that on which they are agreed, there is no need to refer it to the Quran and Sunnah, because it is sufficient to refer to the consensus that has been reached.\nEvidence from the Sunnah\n\nThe report narrated by at-Tirmidhi (2167) from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Indeed Allah will not cause my ummah to unanimously agree on misguidance, and the hand of Allah is with the main body of the Muslims (jama`ah).” Al-Albani classed it as authentic in Sahih at-Tirmidhi.\n\nIbn Abi `Asim narrated in as-Sunnah (83) from Anas ibn Malik that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to say: “Allah has protected my ummah from agreeing on misguidance.”\nAl-Albani classed it as authentic in Sahih al-Jami` (1786).\nIn more than one hadith, the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) enjoined adhering to the main body of the Muslims (jama`ah) and forbade differing from them and splitting from them, as in the hadith in which he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever splits away from the jama`ah (main body of Muslims) by a handspan and dies (in that state), that is a death of Jahiliyyah (ignorance).” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 7143 and Muslim, 1849). And he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever separates the distance of a handspan from the jama`ah (main body of Muslims), has lost his connection with Islam.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 4758; al-Albani classed it as authentic in Sahih Abi Dawud)\nImam ash-Shafa`i (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe fact that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed the Muslims to adhere to the main body of the Muslims (jama`ah) is among the evidence that the consensus of the Muslims – in sha Allah – is binding. (End quote from ar-Risalah, 1/403).\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThese reports were widely known and famous among the Companions and the Successors of the Companions, and none of the earlier or later generations rejected them. Even though they do not reach the level of being mutawatir, when they are taken as a whole, we inevitably conclude that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) explained the high status of this ummah and stated that it is collectively infallible and will not err. (End quote from Rawdat an-Nazir, 1/387)\nThis is some of the evidence that the scholars quote from the Quran and Sunnah to affirm that consensus constitutes shar`i proof.\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe consensus of the ummah is either right or wrong. If it is right, then their consensus constitutes proof, and if it is wrong, then how could this ummah, which is the dearest of nations to Allah since the time of its Prophet until the onset of the Hour, agree on something that is wrong and is not pleasing to Allah? This is utterly impossible.

154213,I have a question since I have been involved in some discussions with some brothers and we can’t get along who is right. The question is about making Dhikr in a loud voice in groups like some people do. Is this considered Bid`ah?,"['Praise be to Allah.Is group Dhikr permissible?\nDhikr in general, if it involves raising the voice and reciting in unison, is a Bid`ah (innovation) that has been introduced into the religion and was not the practice of the righteous early generations.\nAsh-Shatibi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“If there is a text that encourages people to recite particular phrases of Dhikr, and some people commit themselves to gathering to recite Dhikr in unison, or at a certain time that is singled out from all other times, then we should note that although these phrases were referred to in a Shar`i text by way of encouraging people to say them, there is nothing in that to indicate this particular way and time of doing it. Rather in that text there may be something to indicate the contrary, because adhering to something that is not binding in Islam may give the impression that this is part of the religion, especially if it is done by leading figures who are regarded as setting examples in places where people gather, such as the mosque.\nTherefore the early generation did not commit to doing such things and it is more appropriate for them to have done those actions if they were prescribed in Islam. But Dhikr in general is something that is Islamically prescribed in many situations, unlike other acts of worship, and this du`a’ is Dhikr or remembrance of Allah, yet the salaf did not adhere to a particular manner of doing it or limit it to specific times, such that this Dhikr is connected to those particular times, unless there is evidence for a particular time, such as morning or evening. And they did not say it out loud unless the shar`i text indicated that it should be said out loud, such as the Dhikr on the two Eids and the like. With regard to Dhikrs other than that, they persisted in hiding it and said it privately (not out loud). Hence when the Companions raised their voices in Du`a’, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to them: “Be easy with yourselves (and lower your voices), for you are not calling on one who is deaf or absent,” and so on. And they did not recite out loud or in unison.\nEveryone who goes against this principle has gone against the fact that the text is general in meaning and does not restrict it to a particular time, because the one who does that has restricted it on the basis of his own opinion and has gone against those who had better knowledge of Islam than him, namely the righteous early generations (the Salaf – may Allah be pleased with them).” (End quote from\nAl-I`tisam, 1/188-189)\nShaykh Al-Islam (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about a man who established a Waqf and in some of his conditions he stipulated that they should recite whatever they are able to (of Quran) and recite Subhan Allah (Glory be to Allah), La ilaha illallah (there is none worthy of worship but Allah) and Allahu akbar (Allah is most great), and send blessings upon the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) after Fajr until sunrise. Is it better to do that out loud or quietly?\nHe replied:\n“Rather it is better to recite Dhikr and Du`a’ – such as sending blessings upon the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) – quietly, unless there is a reason to do otherwise. At this particular time it is especially preferable (to recite it quietly), because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): {And remember your Lord by your tongue and within yourself, humbly and with fear without loudness in words in the mornings} [Al-A`raf 7:205]. It is narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that when he saw the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) raising their voices in Dhikr, he said: “O people, be easy with yourselves (and lower your voices), for you are not calling on one who is deaf or absent; rather you are calling upon One Who is All-Hearing and Close. The One upon Whom you are calling it is closer to one of you than the neck of his mount.” (End quote from Al-Fatawa Al-Kubra, 4/246)\nThe scholars of the Standing Committee said:\n“Dhikr in unison is an innovation (Bid`ah) because it is something that has been introduced into the religion. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever introduces something into this matter of ours that is not part of it will have it rejected.” And he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Every newly invented matter is an innovation, and every innovation is going astray.” What is prescribed is to remember Allah, may He be exalted, without reciting in unison.” (End quote from Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 24/268)\nIs it permissible to make Dhikr if that could annoy other people who are praying or offering Du`a’?\nIt is more disliked to raise the voice in reciting Dhikr and Du`a’, and to recite in unison, if that could annoy other people who are praying or offering Du`a’ or remembering Allah (Dhikr).\nIt was narrated from `Abdullah ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) observed I`tikaf and addressed the people, saying: “When one of you stands to pray, he is conversing with his Lord, so let each of you think of what he is saying to his Lord, and no one among you should raise his voice over anyone else when reciting in the prayer.” (Narrated by Ahmad, 4909; classed as authentic by Al-Albani)\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: No one should raise his voice in recitation in such a way that he annoys others, such as other worshippers. (End quote from Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 23/61)\nCommentary on the narration of Mu`awiyah ibn Abu Sufyan\nWith regard to the report narrated by Muslim (2701) from Mu`awiyah ibn Abu Sufyan (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came out to a circle of his companions and said: “Why are you sitting here?” They said: We are sitting to remember Allah and praise Him for having guided us to Islam and blessed us with it. He said: “By Allah, are you only sitting for that purpose? They said: By Allah, we are only sitting for that purpose. He said: “I did not ask you to swear because I am accusing you, but Jibreel came to me and told me that Allah was boasting of you to the angels.”\nAnd the report also narrated by Muslim (2699) from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “No people gather in one of the houses of Allah, reciting the Book of Allah and studying it together, but tranquillity will descend upon them, mercy will overshadow them, the angels will surround them and Allah will mention them to those who are with Him.”\n–There is nothing in these reports to suggest that Dhikr should be recited in unison.\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe correct view concerning this matter is that the two Hadiths refer to those who study the Book of Allah together and recite it. Similarly, with regard to people who are remembering Allah, it is general in meaning and should be understood in the light of other, specific reports that describe the way in which Dhikr was done at the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his Companions. It was not known among them that they would remember Allah, may He be exalted, by reciting Dhikr in unison or that they read or recited the Quran in unison. The phrase “studying it together” indicates that this studying together is done one after another. Either one reads, and when he has finished the next one reads the same text, and so on; or each one of them reads one part, and the next one reads from where the first one stopped. This is the apparent meaning of the Hadith. With regard to the other Hadith in which it says that they remembered Allah, we say the same thing: it is general in meaning and should be understood in the light of the texts that speak of the specific way in which Dhikr was done at the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his Companions. It was not known among them that they would get together and recite Dhikr in unison.” (End quote from Fatawa Nur `ala Ad-Darb by Ibn `Uthaymin, 19/30)\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/154213/is-group-dhikr-permissible
