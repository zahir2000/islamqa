145770,"I am going to trade in 24-karat gold, but not on a daily basis. For example, I have a gold ingot and if I realise that the price has risen, I will sell it, but if the price drops I will not sell it. If I am waiting for the price to rise again, is it regarded as trade goods? Do the rulings on zakah apply to it, and what is the rate of zakah? Please note that my intention is not to buy and sell gold, except when the price rises.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nZakah is due on gold of all types, if it reaches the nisab (minimum threshold at which zakah becomes due), regardless of whether it is kept for sale or not, unless it is permissible jewellery that is kept to be worn. In that case, there is a difference of scholarly opinion, but the more correct view is that it is subject to zakah, as has been explained previously in the answers to questions no. 19901 and 59866 .\nSecondly:\nThe nisab for pure (24-karat) gold is 85 grams. If someone owns gold of this amount, and one full hijri year has passed since he acquired it, then he must give zakah on it. The amount he must give is one quarter of one tenth (2.5%), to be given from the gold itself, or the value of the gold must be worked out based on today’s price, then the value of the zakah may be given in cash.\nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 64 .\nWe ask Allah the Most Generous to bless us and you and all the Muslims with halal provision, and to guide us all to the truth, for He, may He be glorified, is able to do that.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/145770/zakah-is-obligatory-on-all-types-of-gold
99642,"I borrowed some money in dollars from a friend, and I paid him back in Saudi riyals in installments based on the rate of exchange at that time (the time of the loan). What is the ruling on that?","['Praise be to Allah.Can you pay off a loan in a different currency?\nThe basic principle is that loans should be repaid in the same currency as they were taken by the borrower, unless the two parties agree at the time of repayment to repay it in a different currency.\xa0\nThere is nothing wrong with that, so long as that is done at the rate of exchange on the day of repayment, not the rate of exchange that existed on the day when the loan was given. This applies to every payment; it is permissible for the two parties to agree at the time of repayment that it may be paid in a different currency , at the current rate of exchange.\xa0\nHaram transactions pertaining to paying off a loan in a different currency\nBut you should be aware that there are three haram forms of such transactions:\xa0\n\nWhere the two parties agree at the time of the loan to pay it back in a different currency. This is haram, because in this case the transaction is actually selling the present currency for another currency to be paid at a later date, which is riba al-nasi’ah .\xa0\n\nOne of the conditions of selling one kind of currency for another is that it be done hand to hand, as is indicated by the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Gold for gold, silver for silver, like for like, same for same, hand to hand… but if these commodities differ, then sell as you wish, if it is hand to hand.” (Narrated by Muslim (1578) from ‘Ubadah ibn as-Samit)\xa0\nThe currencies that exist nowadays are based on the value of gold and silver, so they come under the same rulings as them.\xa0\n\nWhere they do not agree to that initially, but they agree on a different currency at the time of repayment and they work it out based on the rate of exchange at the time of the loan. This is also haram, and it is like the form mentioned above.\xa0\n\nThe jurists quoted as evidence that it is haram the well known hadith that was narrated by Ahmad (6239), Abu Dawud (3354), Al-Nasa’i (4582), At-Tirmidhi (1242) and Ibn Majah (2262) from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: I used to sell camels for dinars [i.e., to be paid at a later date] but accept dirhams, and sell them for dirhams but accept dinars. I asked the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about that and he said: “There is nothing wrong with taking it based on the current price, so long as you do not separate with something still outstanding.”\xa0\nThis hadith was classed as sahih by some scholars, such as An-Nawawi and Ahmad Shakir; others classed the words of Ibn ‘Umar, but not the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), as sahih, such as Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar and Al-Albani. (See: Irwa’ al-Ghalil, 5/173)\xa0\nThere is another reason for this prohibition, which is that if you take more than the price on the day of repayment, then you have made a profit on something that is not in your possession, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade making a profit on anything that is not in one’s possession. (Narrated by the authors of Al-Sunan with a sahih isnad)\xa0\n\nWhere they agree at the time of repayment to repay it in a different currency, but they part with something till outstanding. For example, if the loan is one thousand dollars, and they agree when the time comes to pay it back in pounds, let’s say 5000, and he takes 4000 but the borrower still owes 1000. This is not permissible, because when selling one currency for another, it is stipulated that it should be done hand to hand, as stated above.\xa0\n\nAl-Khattabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said, commenting on the hadith of Ibn ‘Umar quoted above: “It is stipulated that they should not part with anything outstanding between them, because paying off dirhams with dinars is an exchange of currency, and a transaction that involves exchanging currencies is not valid unless it is done hand to hand.” (`Awn Al-Ma`bud)\xa0\nBut if the loan is to be paid off in installments, then there is nothing wrong with agreeing to pay each installment at the rate of exchange on the day it is paid. There are no shar’i reservations about that, because it does not involve any delay in exchanging the currency. \xa0\nThere follow some comments of the scholars concerning this issue:\xa0\nThe scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas were asked: I borrowed some money from someone (French currency) on the condition that I would give it back to him in France, but when he came to Algeria he asked me to give him Algerian dirhams with some extra. What is the ruling on that?\xa0\nThey replied:\xa0\n“It is permissible to pay him back in Algeria the same amount in French currency or the equivalent at the current rate of exchange in Algerian currency, so long as it is handed over before you part.” (Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Da’imah, 14/143)\xa0\nThey were also asked (14/144): What is the ruling on borrowing money in one currency then paying the loan back a few months later in a different currency, when the price of the currency may have changed during the period of the loan?\xa0\nThey replied:\n“If a person borrows money without stipulating any interest to be paid, or he repays it in another currency at the rate of exchange at the time of repayment, without stipulating anything that benefits the lender, that is permissible, because that involves cooperation between Muslims and meeting their needs. But if he stipulates that he has to pay interest on this loan or that he has to give it back in a certain currency or offer any benefit to the lender, then it is haram, because it is riba that is forbidden according to the Quran and Sunnah and scholarly consensus.”\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: One of my relatives who lives in Cairo has asked me for a loan of 2500 Egyptian pounds, and I sent him 2000 dollars, which he sold and got 2490 Egyptian pounds. Now he wants to pay back the loan. Please note that we did not agree on a time or method for repayment. My question is: Should I take from him 2490 Egyptian pounds, which is currently worth 1800 US dollars (less than the amount that I gave him in dollars) or should I take 2000 dollars, knowing that this will mean that he has to buy the dollars for approximately 2800 Egyptian pounds (i.e., over 300 pounds more than he actually got)?\xa0\nHe replied:\xa0\n“What he must do is return the dollars that he borrowed from you, because this is the loan that he got from you. But if you agree that he will give you Egyptian pounds, there is nothing wrong with that. Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: We used to sell camels in al-Baqi’ for dirhams and accept dinars for them, and we would sell for dinars and accept dirhams. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is nothing wrong with taking it based on the current price, so long as you do not separate with something still outstanding.” This is selling one currency for another, which is akin to selling gold for silver. If you and he agree that he will repay you for these dollars in Egyptian pounds, so long as you do not take from him more pounds than are dictated by the rate of exchange at the time when you agree to that, there is nothing wrong with it. For example, if 2000 dollars are equivalent to 2800 pounds now, it is not permissible for you to take three thousand pounds from him, but it is permissible for you to take 2800 pounds, and it is permissible for you to take 2000 dollars only, i.e., you should take it at the current price or less, and do not take more because if you take more, you will have made a profit on something that is not in your possession, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade making a profit on anything that is not in one’s possession.. But if you take less, you will have taken some of what you are entitled to, and waived the rest, and there is nothing wrong with that.” (Fatawa Islamiyyah, 2/414)\xa0\nFor, more, please see these answers: 23388 , 12541 , 381582 , 109938 , and 217847 .\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/99642/can-you-pay-off-a-loan-in-a-different-currency
111913,"A company has a large amount of money left over in their budget, which it gives to its employees as a reward for doing extra work, and the employees sign for that and receive it by turns each year, even though they did not do any extra work. Is it permissible to accept this money?","['Praise be to Allah.Those in charge of this company should not mess about with this wealth, and they should put any surplus back into the company’s coffers. That is because this money was allocated to cover expenditures, so if the expenditures did not consume it all, it is not permissible to give it to someone who did not do any work. Rather they must return it, even if that means that they will not pay them extra in the following year or in other years. That is because they are entrusted with it, and the one who is entrusted with something must be honest with what was entrusted to him. If they need extra work to be done outside regular hours, then employees can do that work, and then be given as much as they deserve.\nHowever, for the employees, if the managers of that department decide to do it in this way and give them money in this basis, they can accept it, based on what is mentioned in the hadith, that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him): “Whatever wealth comes to you when you are not hoping for it or asking for it, then take it, otherwise do not hope for it.” End quote.\nShaykh ‘Abdullah ibn Jibril (may Allah preserve him).\nFatawa ‘Ulama’ al-Balad al-Haram (p. 357).']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/111913/the-company-gave-them-money-for-extra-work-even-though-they-did-not-do-it
93519,"How can I reconcile between being a modern teenage girl and a girl who pleases her family and is loved by all, and how can I rid myself of a friend whom I do not like and I cannot find any way to like her?","['Praise be to Allah.You should note that the stage of adolescence is the most sensitive stage that a person goes through, because during this stage there are many physical, mental, emotional and sexual changes, and the shaytan is keen to tempt a person during this stage by whatever means and methods he can. Hence every adolescent boy and girl must be cautious. What we recommend at this stage is:\xa0\nHow to be a good Muslim girl\n\nStrive to do acts of worship, both obligatory and mustahabb, and strive to keep away from haram (impermissible), doubtful and makruh (disliked) things.\xa0\n\nAmong the means which will help you to avoid falling into the trap of the shaytan and keep away from disobedience to Allah are:\xa0\n\nRemembering that Allah is always watching and bearing in mind His greatness, especially when you are alone.\nNot following in the footsteps of the shaytan . Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “O you who believe! Follow not the footsteps of Shaytan (Satan). And whosoever follows the footsteps of Shaytan (Satan), then, verily, he commands Al-Fahsha’ [i.e. to commit indecency (illegal sexual intercourse)], and Al-Munkar [disbelief and polytheism (i.e. to do evil and wicked deeds; and to speak or to do what is forbidden in Islam)]” [al-Nur 24:21]. The steps of the shaytan are like a chain; the one who follows them will not stop and each step is more serious than the one that came before it, unless a person checks himself and gives it up and repents from every sin.\nRepenting from every sin . A Muslim may fall into sin, but if that happens what he must do is give it up and repent, and not continue and persist in it. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And those who, when they have committed Fahishah (illegal sexual intercourse) or wronged themselves with evil, remember Allah and ask forgiveness for their sins; — and none can forgive sins but Allah — and do not persist in what (wrong) they have done, while they know” [Aal ‘Imran 3:135]. And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Every son of Adam commits sin, and the best of those who commit sin are those who repent.” Narrated by Ibn Majah (4251).\xa0 Shaykh al-Albani said: It is hasan.\nThinking of death and the meeting with Allah. The one who remembers that death may come to him suddenly and that he will meet Allah, Who will ask him about his deeds, will avoid sin.\nTurning to Allah and praying that He will help you to do good deeds and give up evil deeds, for Allah will never let down the one who calls upon Him. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And when My slaves ask you (O Muhammad) concerning Me, then (answer them), I am indeed near (to them by My Knowledge). I respond to the invocations of the supplicant when he calls on Me (without any mediator or intercessor). So let them obey Me and believe in Me, so that they may be led aright” [al-Baqarah 2:186].\n\n\nStrive to find good companions and keep away from bad companions, for a friend will have an impact on his friends, as it was said:\n\nDo not ask about a man, rather ask about his friend, for every friend follows the example of his friends.\xa0\n\nYou should fill your time with beneficial and useful things, both religious and worldly, and beware of free time for it is one of the greatest sources of corruption at this stage.\xa0\nIf you want to win people’s hearts, then treat them kindly and have a good attitude towards them, cooperate with them and meet their needs, for in this way you will be able to win their hearts. \xa0\n\nAmong the wisdom narrated from ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) are his words:\xa0\nDo favours to whoever you want and you will be like his master, and be in need of whoever you want and you will be like his prisoner, and be independent of whoever you want and you will be his equal. \xa0\nWe will say something in general terms about winning people’s hearts and earning their love.\xa0\nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Verily, those who believe [in the Oneness of Allah and in His Messenger (Muhammad )] and work deeds of righteousness, the Most Gracious (Allah) will bestow love for them(in the hearts of the believers)”\xa0[Maryam 19:96]\nQatadah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his commentary on this verse: This means, by Allah, in the hearts of the believers. It was mentioned to us that Haram ibn Hayyan used to say: No person turns with all his heart to Allah but Allah will turn the hearts of the believers towards him, until He blesses him with their love and compassion. Tafsir al-Tabari (18/266).\xa0\nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When Allah loves a person, He calls Jibril (A) and says: ‘I love So and So, so love him.’ So Jibril loves him, then he calls out to the people of heaven, ‘Allah loves So and So, so love him.’ So the people of heaven love him and he finds acceptance on earth. If Allah hates someone, He calls Jibril and says: ‘I hate So and So, so hate him.’ So Jibril hates him, then he calls out to the people of heaven: ‘Allah hates So and So, so hate him.’ So they hate him and he is hated on earth.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (7485) and Muslim (2637).\xa0\nNow you see that winning people’s hearts and earning their love is not within your capacity or that of any other human being, rather it is in the Hand of Allah Alone, may He be glorified and exalted. He is the One Who softens hearts towards one another and He is the One Who separates them. He is the One Who gives and withholds, lowers and raises. All of this is part and parcel of His being the Rabb (Lord or Cherisher and Sustainer) of His creation, may He be glorified.\xa0\nHow to attain the love of Allah\nAs for how to attain the love of Allah , this is the greatest desire of the believer, and this is the great and noble purpose for which there is only one way to attain it, which is by following and obeying His Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him). Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Say (O Muhammad to mankind): “If you (really) love Allah, then follow me (i.e. accept Islamic Monotheism, follow the Quran and the Sunnah), Allah will love you and forgive you your sins. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful”\xa0[Aal ‘Imran 3:31]\nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said that Allah said: “Whosoever shows enmity to someone devoted to Me (wali), I shall be at war with him. My slave draws not near to Me with anything more loved by Me than the religious duties I have enjoined upon him, and My slave continues to draw near to Me with supererogatory works so that I shall love him. When I love him I am his hearing with which he hears, his seeing with which he sees, his hand with which he strikes and his foot with which he walks. Were he to ask [something] of Me, I would surely give it to him, and were he to ask Me for refuge, I would surely grant him it. I do not hesitate about anything as much as I hesitate about [seizing] the soul of My faithful slave: he hates death and I hate hurting him.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (6502).\xa0\nIf there remain after that people of evil and corruption who love to spread evil among those who believe, and they want to harm you, and want you to agree with them, and are annoyed by your obedience to the Most Merciful, and your keenness to worship Him and attain all the branches of faith, then do not pay any attention to them, and continue on your straight path, and be with His righteous slaves.\xa0\nHere we should point out the importance of respecting parents and relatives , for they are the most deserving of good treatment and of your efforts to win their hearts. It is essential to be patient with parents when they regard you as still being young, because no matter how old you get, you are still young in your parents’ eyes. Moreover they have the right of being in charge of you, looking after you, raising and teaching you, and disciplining you. They are entrusted with your care, and are responsible for you in this world and in the Hereafter. Part of their duty is that they should ensure that you follow proper etiquette and pay attention to the rulings of Islam, and respect the people’s customs and traditions so long as they do not go against shari’ah. All of that may conflict with the desires and inclinations of teenagers, which may lead to the situation that you describe, and you feel that it is a problem, i.e., reconciling between what is required of you as a teenager and the whims and desires of your own nafs (desirous soul), and what the duties of etiquette demand of you, and what your parents’ rights dictate, that you should respect and accept the guardianship of your parents. \xa0\nHence you will know the answer to the rest of your question. If this friend is a good person, then try to love her and grow close to her, and if she is a bad and corrupt person, then keep away from her and she will also keep away from you.\xa0\n“Bad statements are for bad people (or bad women for bad men) and bad people for bad statements (or bad men for bad women). Good statements are for good people (or good women for good men) and good people for good statements (or good men for good women): such (good people) are innocent of (every) bad statement which they say; for them is forgiveness, and Rizqun Karim (generous provision, i.e. Paradise)”\xa0[Al-Nur 24:26].\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/93519/how-to-be-a-good-muslim-girl
