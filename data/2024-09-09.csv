288659,"Is it permissible to blow into my cupped hands and recite the Mu`awwidhatayn [the last two surahs of the Quran, seeking refuge with Allah] and Al-Ikhlas, then wipe the hands over all the children in one go, or must I recite them three times for each child separately?","['Praise be to Allah.It is permissible for a person to recite the Mu`awwidhatayn, blow into his cupped hands and wipe his child with his hands.\nIt was narrated that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to seek refuge from the jinn and from the evil eye until the Mu`awwidhatayn were revealed, after which he began to recite them and stopped reciting other prayers. (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi (2058); Al-Albani classed it as authentic in Sahih At-Tirmidhi)\nBlowing with some saliva [into one’s cupped hands] and reciting the Mu`awwidhatayn is based on the practice of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) just before going to sleep. He used to recite [the Mu`awwidhatayn] into his cupped hands and blow into them, then he would wipe his blessed body with them. When he fell sick, ‘Aa’ishah would do that for him, which indicates that for a child, his mother can recite the Mu`awwidhatayn and blow into her cupped hands, then wipe the child with them.\nIt was narrated that `Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: When the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) went to his bed, he would blow into his cupped hands and recite Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad [Al-Ikhlas] and the Mu`awwidhatayn, then he would wipe his face and whatever of his body his hands could reach. ‘Aa’ishah said: When he fell sick, he would tell me to do that for him. (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 5748).\nDr. Ahmad Al-Qadi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: I asked our shaykh [Ibn ‘Uthaymin] (may Allah have mercy on him): How may we recite wird [daily litany] over children?\nHe replied: You should put your cupped hands together, recite and blow into them, and wipe them over the child. But if the child is not with you, then it will be a supplication (Du`a’), not recitation. (End quote from Thamarat At-Tadwin, p. 9)\nIf someone wants to seek refuge with Allah for more than one child, is it sufficient for him to wipe his hands over both children in one go, or should he do that for each one separately? We have not come across anything regarding that, so to be on the safe side, he should recite ruqyah and wipe his hands over each child separately.\nFor more details, please see the answer to question no. 174933 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/288659/how-to-recite-the-muawwidhatayn-for-children
163573,"I wanted to ask whether it is allowed to say ""Bismillahir-Rahmanir-Rahim"" instead of ""Bismillah"" before one eats. There was a discussion between a sister and me, and I said it is a Bida, but the sister insisted that there is nothing wrong with that. What is the right ruling on this issue?","['Praise be to Allah.Significance of saying Bismillah before eating\nThe phrase that is prescribed for mentioning Allah when eating is to say “Bismillah ” (In the name of Allah), because of the report narrated by `A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When one of you eats some food, let him say Bismillah , and if he forgets to do so at the beginning, let him say Bismillah fi awwalihi wa akhirihi (In the name of Allah at the beginning and end). (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 1781; classed as authentic by Shaykh Al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him))\xa0\nBismillah or Bismillah Ar-Rahman Ar-Rahim?\nThe scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) differed concerning saying Bismillah Ar-Rahman Ar-Rahim (in the name of Allah, the Most Gracious the Most Merciful). Most of the scholars are of the view that there is nothing wrong with this addition.\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If one says when eating, Bismillah Ar-Rahman Ar-Rahim, that is good and more perfect. (End quote from Al-Fatawa Al-Kubra, 5/480)\xa0\nIt says in Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah, (8/92): The jurists are of the view that mentioning the name of Allah when beginning to eat is a Sunnah, and the phrase to be used is Bismillah or Bismillah Ar-Rahman Ar-Rahim. (End quote)\xa0\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is more important to note the phrase to be used when mentioning the name of Allah. … The best is to say Bismillah Ar-Rahman Ar-Rahim, but if one says Bismillah , that is sufficient and fulfills the Sunnah. (End quote from Al-Adhkar, 1/231)\nAl-Hafidh ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) followed that with his comment: I have not seen any particular evidence to support what he claims about it being better. (End quote from Fat-h Al-Bari)\xa0\nShaykh Al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) said: And I say: There is nothing better than his Sunnah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). The best of guidance is the guidance of Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and if nothing is proven concerning mentioning the name of Allah when eating except to say “Bismillah,” then it is not permissible to add anything to it, let alone suggest that the longer phrase is better than it, because saying such a thing is contrary to what is referred to in the Hadith: “The best of guidance is the guidance of Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).” (End quote from As-Silsilah As-Sahihah, 1/343)\nBased on this, it is better to limit it to saying Bismillah when starting to eat, and not add anything to it. But if one does add to it by saying Bismillah Ar-Rahman Ar-Rahim, there is nothing wrong with that according to the majority of scholars.\xa0\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 22186 , 173672 , 175312 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/163573/saying-bismillah-ar-rahman-ar-rahim-before-eating
507192,"Is it permissible for a university student to use the AI app ChatGPT to help in writing program code that has to do with university assignments, as a type of research and learning? Is it regarded as being like using the search engine Google when it is used for the purpose of research?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThere is nothing wrong with using AI for beneficial and useful purposes, because the basic principle is that useful things are permissible, as Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{It is He who created for you all of that which is on the earth} [Al-Baqarah 2:29]\n{Say, “Who has forbidden the adornment of Allah which He has produced for His servants and the good [lawful] things of provision?” Say, “They are for those who believe during the worldly life [but] exclusively for them on the Day of Resurrection”} [Al-A`raf 7:32].\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: One of the principles affirmed by the scholars is that useful things are permissible and are allowed, except those for which there is proof that they are prohibited. This principle is based on the texts of the Qur’an and Sunnah.\nIn the Quran, Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{It is He who created for you all of that which is on the earth} [Al-Baqarah 2:29].\nIn the Sunnah, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah, may He be exalted, has enjoined obligatory duties, so do not neglect them. He has set limits, so do not transgress them. He has said nothing about some things out of mercy towards you, not out of forgetfulness, so do not enquire about them.” And he said: “Whatever He said nothing about is overlooked.” (End quote from Majmu` Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 12/169)\nSecondly:\nWith regard to using AI to write program codes having to do with university assignments, what appears to be the case is that it is not permissible, because the aim of the assignments is to train the student, measure his ability and make sure that he has revised and studied the subject material, and relying on AI to do these assignments will undermine all these objectives. It is like taking the codes from a classmate, which means that the student will put very little effort into the assignment, so it is more akin to cheating than to researching on Google and the like. If someone looks on Google and takes an already-written assignment, that is cheating, because he has put little effort into it himself, and this is the same. If you are uncertain and have some doubts, you should ask the teacher whether it is allowed to do the assignment using AI or not.\nFor more information on the dangers that AI poses to university education, please see: Adh-Dhaka’ Al-Istina`i Fursah lit-Ta`lim Al-Jami`i Aw Khatar ‘Alayhi?\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/507192/what-is-the-ruling-on-using-ai-to-write-school-assignments
125425,Does a man have to cover his shoulders whilst praying? Is praying with bare shoulders permissible or prohibited?,"['Praise be to Allah.Is it obligatory to cover the `Awrah in prayer?\nThe jurists unanimously agreed that it is obligatory to cover the `Awrah whilst praying . The man’s `Awrah is between the navel and the knee, and some of them include the navel and the knee in the `Awrah.\xa0\nIs covering the shoulders in prayer obligatory?\nThey differed as to whether it is obligatory to cover the shoulder, which is the area between the shoulder blade and the neck. The majority are of the view that it is not obligatory , but the Hanbalis are of the view that it is mandatory in obligatory prayers in particular, and that the prayer is not valid otherwise.\xa0\nThe majority quoted as evidence the Hadith narrated by Al-Bukhari (361) and Muslim (3010) from Sa`id ibn Al-Harith who said: We asked Jabir ibn `Abdullah about praying in a single garment and he said: I went out with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) on one of his journeys and I came at night for some purpose, and I found him praying and I was wearing a single garment. I wrapped myself in it and prayed beside him. When he had finished he said: “What is this walking at night O Jabir?” I told him of my need, and when I had finished he said: “What is this wrapping that I see?” I said: It is too small. He said: “If it is large enough, wrap it around the body, and if it is too small, tie it around your waist.”\xa0\nWhen he asked him about walking at night, he was asking him why he had come at this time.\xa0\nThe Hanbalis quoted as evidence the Hadith narrated by Al-Bukhari (359) and Muslim (516) from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No one of you should pray in a single garment with nothing on his shoulders.”\nThe majority of scholars interpreted this as meaning it is recommended, so as to reconcile between the reports.\xa0\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Sharh Muslim: With regard to the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “No one of you should pray in a single garment with nothing on his shoulders”, the scholars said: The reason behind it is that if he wraps it around his waist and no part of it is on his shoulders, there is no guarantee that his `Awrah will not become uncovered , unlike if he places part of it over his shoulder. And because he may need to hold it with his hand or both hands so he will be distracted by that, and will miss out on the Sunnah of placing the right hand over the left hand beneath his chest, and raising the hands when it is Sunnah to do so, and so on. And because he is not covering the upper body which is the place of adornment. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): {Take your adornment (by wearing your clean clothes)} [Al-A`raf 7:31].\nMoreover Malik, Abu Hanifah, and Ash-Shafi`i (may Allah have mercy on them) and the majority of scholars said that this is a prohibition in the sense of being disliked, and it is not prohibited. So if a man prays in a single garment that covers his `Awrah, but no part of it is on his shoulder, then his prayer is valid although it is makrooh, whether he was able to put something on his shoulder or not.\xa0\nAhmad and some of the Salaf (may Allah have mercy on them) said: If he was able to put something over his shoulder, his prayer is not valid unless he covers his shoulder, because of the apparent meaning of the Hadith. And another report was narrated from Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) stating that his prayer is valid, but he is sinning by not doing that.\xa0\nThe evidence of the majority is the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in the Hadith of Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him): “If it is big enough, wrap it around the body, and if it is too small, tie it around your waist.” This was narrated by Al-Bukhari, and by Muslim at the end of the book in his lengthy Hadith. (End quote)\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said, in the commentary on Sharh Zad Al-Mustaqni`: Differentiating between obligatory and optional prayers is contrary to the apparent meaning of the Hadith. Moreover, the author said: “with one of his shoulders” but the Hadith indicates that both shoulders must be covered. What the author said is the well-known view of the Madhhab.\xa0\nThe second opinion is that covering the shoulders is Sunnah and not obligatory, and there is no difference between obligatory and optional prayers, because of the Hadith, “if it is too small, tie it around your waist”. This view is the more correct one, and it is the view of the majority. The idea that there should be something on the shoulders is not because the shoulders are `Awrah , rather it is so that the clothing may be complete and the waist wrapper be tied properly, because if it is not secured at the shoulders, it may come loose and fall. In this case the covering of the shoulders is sought for another purpose; it is not sought in and of itself. (End quote from Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti`, 2/168).\xa0\nAlso please see Al-Mughni (1/338) and Al-Majmu` (3/180)\xa0\nTo sum up, it is not obligatory for a man to cover his shoulders or shoulder blades when praying, but it is recommended to do so as an adornment and out of respect for the prayer and the fact that he is standing before his Lord, may He be Glorified and Exalted; but if he prays with his shoulders or shoulder blade bare, his prayer is valid.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/125425/can-you-pray-with-your-shoulders-exposed
