120672,"How can I deal with interference from my husband’s family in my personal affairs? Is it regarded as bad manners if I answer them back, because they are of the type that will persists if I keep quiet? Allah alone knows that I have ignored their interference and attempts to provoke me many times, but it seems that ignoring them is not working, because they persist in asking questions. By Allah, O shaykh, one of my husband’s sisters was talking about polygamy, when my husband was sitting next to me, and she said: What’s wrong with you marrying another one? And I was sitting right there, and she did not care about my feelings. At that time I was newly married, and was visiting them. By Allah, they knew nothing about me then to justify saying such things. If my husband praises me for something that I did – which is something that rarely happens in front of them – she says: That is her duty. All of this happened in front of me, and – by Allah – I never uttered a single word, because we, my sisters and I, were raised not to answer back to the one who mistreats us. I even do not know how to respond politely, except very rarely, and afterwards I feel guilty. I could say a lot about their interference and questions, even with regard to breastfeeding my child, and the place where bathe him, and his personal hygiene. According to my husband’s testimony, I do not neglect him or fall short in taking care of him. Even their children repeat the same questions, to the extent that I hate going and visiting them, and when I visit them I do not show that I am upset. Sometimes she says hurtful or embarrassing things, and I act normally, but I am very angry inside. Moreover, my husband said: If you tell anyone about the way my family treats you, I shall ask you about it before Allah. With regard to her questions, I have already spoken with my sister and my brother’s wife about the things they do and the way they treat me. They – Allah knows – are wise and they told me: Answer back politely regarding the things that you cannot keep quiet about, and whatever you can ignore, ignore it. Will I be sinning if I do that? Does my husband have the right to warn me not to speak about the way they treat me to anyone, even though any person would need to discuss his problems and concerns with someone so that he can get it off his chest. By Allah, I feel so suppressed that I do not like to see them or hear their voices, because I become very angry, even with my husband; I have become hot-tempered and I hate to treat him roughly. I understand that he does not want the image of his family to be tarnished in anyone’s eyes, but I have the right to seek advice from people who are older than me and have more experience in life. Is it permissible for me to consult and express my concerns to someone who is trustworthy, or must I remain suppressed and angry? How can I deal with my husband and his family in a way that is pleasing to Allah and does not trample my rights or overstep the mark in my relationship with them? Because many families break up when one of the two party oversteps the mark in dealing with the other party, and when troubles are not contained. Is it permissible for me to refuse to live near his family, so as to avoid problems?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThere are many problems that may arise between the wife and her husband’s family. In order to solve any problem, we should examine the causes before anything else:\n1. \xa0The causes may be connected to the attitude of the husband’s family. There are some people for whom causing trouble is second nature, and they make mountains out of molehills and exaggerate about trivial, insignificant matters. But when people are like this, problems do not exist only between them and their son’s wife; rather they have troubles with everyone. Solving this problem requires a great deal of effort to teach them right from wrong and good from evil, and to educate them about faith and obedience to Allah. In this case, the husband who is aware of his family’s nature and attitude should not pay any attention to what they say about his wife, and he should not attach any significance to it. Rather he should try to advise his family and call them to what is good, and he should comfort his wife if she suffers mistreatment at the hands of his family.\n2.\xa0The cause of troubles may be the fault of both sides: jealousy that takes root in the hearts of the husband’s family, when they see how fond he is of his wife and how he shows compassion to her. The solution to this problem is compensating them by showing extra compassion and special care towards them and giving them a lot of gifts, whilst not showing affection to his wife in front of them. Moreover, the husband should pay special attention towards them, and offer a great deal of supplication asking Allah to remove the jealousy from their hearts.\n3.The cause of these problems may be what the husband’s family see in the wife of falling short with their son, or with her children, or in taking care of her house, or what she demonstrates of shameful behaviour by not showing respect to their mother, and other things that could be real – not made-up – in many wives. This is the silver lining to these problems, because through it the wife may come to realise her shortcomings and negligence, and thus be able to make up for her shortcomings and rectify the situation, for the wife cannot claim to be perfect in her behaviour and attitude. This is the easiest cause of such problems to fix, because the solution is easy and possible; the wife can rectify herself and mend the relationship between her and her husband’s family by improving her behaviour and giving each person his or her due of respect. Thus she will be able to rectify the situation, resolve the problem and gain her husband’s appreciation.\nSecondly:\nWhat we think is that the wife should obey her husband if he tells her not to tell anyone else of what happens between her and his family. This decision on the husband’s part serves an important interest that surpasses the interest of the wife venting and getting things off her chest. That is because if, in such cases, the problems become widely known, everyone will have an opinion or will use it to come up with some scheme, or will give bad advice for solving these problems, which will only make matters worse and create further problems, and will generate more causes of trouble, with the result that it may become very difficult to find a solution after that.\nIt is permissible for the wife to complain to a wise person, and that does not come under the heading of backbiting, which is prohibited. See the answer to question no. 7660. At the same time, the husband has the right to prevent her from doing this permissible thing, if he thinks that there is a legitimate purpose to be served by that.\nWhat we think is that you made a mistake by not complying with his advice, and speaking to your sister and your brother’s wife about what has been going on between you and your husband’s family. In order to rectify that, you must repent and seek forgiveness, and not carry on talking to them about this matter. You should urge them not to tell anyone else about anything that you told them. There is no need to confess to your husband what you did, because it will serve no purpose; rather it could result in more trouble. For example, he could start resenting you and what you did; or he could prevent you from speaking to your sister and your brother’s wife at all. All of that is possible, because the Shaytan is always present and has a great impact at such times, for he will fan the flames, exacerbate the matter and will do his utmost to create enmity and resentment because of this trouble.\nThirdly:\nDealing with your husband and his family requires great wisdom on your part. But you – in sha Allah – are able to cope with that, as is quite evident to us from your saying “because we, my sisters and I, were raised not to answer back to the one who mistreats us. I even do not know how to respond politely, except very rarely, and afterwards I feel guilty” and from your other comment “and when I visit them I do not show that I am upset. Sometimes she says hurtful or embarrassing things, and I act normally, but I am very angry inside.” This is a thing that no one can do except one who has self-control, and no one can do that except wise people.\nWhat is required of you now is the following:\n\nIgnore what you hear from your husband’s\xa0 family which you can tell is aimed at upsetting and provoking you and is pure fabrication, with no substance.\nPay attention to yourself, your house, your children and whatever you hear from them that is true [in terms of shortcomings]; you have to rectify these things and do them properly.\nTry to be friendly towards his family, showing good manners, speaking gently and behaving kindly. Make sure to give them appropriate gifts from time to time, or some food that you have made for them, or some sweets that you have made specially for them. For it is well known that gifts have a great impact in bringing people together and spreading love and affection between them.\nBe kind to your husband by not telling anyone about how his family treat you, and make him trust you more; do not let him hear or see anything from you that he does not like.\nHowever, that does not mean that you should keep completely quiet about fabricated accusations that may be made against you. But we advise you to refer that to your husband, and let him take responsibility for putting things right and giving each person their due. Show him that your family raised you well.\nFinally, there is nothing wrong with suggesting to your husband that you should move away and not live close to his family. However, he is not obliged to respond. Your right is only to have separate accommodation, and you already have that. But wisdom and your best interests dictate that the husband should move further away from his family, if he realises that there is no harmony between them and his wife. Perhaps moving away may contribute to strengthening the bonds between all parties, and may remove some of these ill feelings and resentment from everyone’s hearts.\n\nSeek the help of Allah your Lord by offering supplication, and doing the duties that are required of you. We ask Allah, may He be exalted, to enable you to do that which pleases Him, and to reconcile between you all.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/120672/causes-of-problems-between-the-wife-and-her-husbands-family-and-ways-to-solve-them
108579,What is the true belief? I would also like to know about some false beliefs.,"[""Praise be to Allah.1.It is known on the basis of shar‘i evidence from the Qur’an and Sunnah that deeds and actions can only be valid and accepted by Allah if they stem from sound belief. If the belief is not correct, then the actions and words that stem from it are invalid, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And whoever denies the faith - his work has become worthless, and he, in the Hereafter, will be among the losers}[al-Ma’idah 5:5]\n{And it was already revealed to you and to those before you that if you should associate [anything] with Allah, your deeds would surely become worthless}[az-Zumar 39:65].\nAnd there are many similar verses.\n2.The Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) clearly indicate that sound belief may be summed up as: believing in Allah, His angels, His Books, His Messengers, the Last Day, and the divine decree, both good and bad. These six matters form the basis of sound belief with which the Book of Allah was sent down and with which Allah sent His Messenger Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nThere is a great deal of evidence for these six fundamentals in the Qur’an and Sunnah, such as the verses in which Allah, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Righteousness is not that you turn your faces toward the east or the west, but [true] righteousness is [in] one who believes in Allah , the Last Day, the angels, the Book, and the prophets …}[al-Baqarah 2:177]\n{The Messenger has believed in what was revealed to him from his Lord, and [so have] the believers. All of them have believed in Allah and His angels and His books and His messengers, [saying], “We make no distinction between any of His messengers”}[al-Baqarah 2:285]\n{O you who have believed, believe in Allah and His Messenger and the Book that He sent down upon His Messenger and the Scripture which He sent down before. And whoever disbelieves in Allah, His angels, His books, His messengers, and the Last Day has certainly gone far astray}[an-Nisa’ 4:136].\nThere are also many sahih hadiths which point to these fundamentals, such as the famous sahih hadith which was narrated by Muslim in his Sahih from Amir al-Mu’minin ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which Jibril (peace be upon him) asked the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) about faith, and he said to him: “Faith is to believe in Allah, His angels, His Books, His Messengers, and the Last Day, and to believe in the divine decree, both good and bad…” This hadith was also narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim from Abu Hurayrah.\nFrom these six fundamentals stem everything that the Muslim must believe in with regard to Allah, may He be glorified, and with regard to the resurrection, and other matters of the unseen.\n3.Belief in Allah, may He be glorified: this includes believing that He is the [only] true God Who is deserving of worship, to the exclusion of all others, because He is the Creator of people, the One Who cares for them, the One Who provides for them, the One Who has knowledge of all that that do, both in secret and openly, the One Who is able to reward those who obey Him and punish those who disobey Him. It is for this purpose of worshipping Him that Allah created the two races [of humankind and the jinn] and commanded them [to worship Him alone].\nThe true meaning of this worship is to single out Allah, may He be glorified, alone for all acts of worship that people do, such as calling upon Him in supplication, fear, hope, prayer, fasting, offering sacrifices, making vows and other types of worship, which are to be done for Him alone, with humility, seeking His pleasure and fearing His wrath, with perfect love for Him, humbling themselves before His might.\nAnother part of believing in Allah is believing in everything that He has enjoined upon His slaves and made obligatory for them, such as the five pillars of Islam – which are: testifying that there is no god worthy of worship except Allah, and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah; establishing prayer; giving zakah; fasting Ramadan; and going on pilgrimage to the Sacred House of Allah (Hajj), for the one who is able to do that – and other obligatory deeds which are mentioned in Islamic teachings.\nThe greatest and most important of these pillars is testifying that there is no god worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. Testifying that there is no god worthy of worship except Allah dictates that one should devote worship sincerely to Allah alone, and refrain from worshipping anyone or anything besides Him. This is the meaning of La ilaha illa Allah (there is no god worthy of worship except Allah), for what it means is that there is none that is deserving of worship except Allah, so everything that is worshipped besides Allah, whether a human, an angel, a jinni or anything else, is worshipped on the basis of falsehood, and the only one Who is worshipped on the basis of truth is Allah alone, as He, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{That is because Allah is the Truth, and that which they call upon other than Him is falsehood}[al-Hajj 22:62].\nAnother part of believing in Allah is believing in His beautiful names and sublime attributes, as narrated in His Book and in sound reports from His Messenger, without distorting or denying the meaning, without discussing how they are, and without likening Him to His creation. Rather they must be taken as they are, without discussing how, whilst believing in what is indicated by the sublime attributes that are ascribed to Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. We must affirm these attributes in the manner that is befitting to Him, without likening Him to His creation in any of His attributes, as Allah, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the Hearing, the Seeing}[ash-Shura 42:11].\n4.Believing in the angels, which includes believing in them in general terms and in specific terms. So the Muslim believes that Allah has angels whom He created to obey Him, and He has described them as honoured slaves who do not speak until He has spoken and they carry out His commands:\n{He knows what is [presently] before them and what will be after them, and they cannot intercede except on behalf of one whom He approves. And they are filled with reverent awe of Him}[al-Anbiya’ 21:28].\nThey are of many kinds. Some of them are appointed to be the bearers of the Throne; some of them are the keepers of Paradise and Hell; some of them are appointed to keep a record of people’s deeds.\nAnd we believe in specific terms in those whom Allah and His Messenger have mentioned by name, such as Jibril, Mika’il, Malik the keeper of Hell, and Israfil who is appointed to blow the Trumpet [on the Day of Resurrection]; he is mentioned in sound hadiths. It is proven in as-Sahih from ‘A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The angels were created from light, the jinn were created from smokeless fire, and Adam was created from what has been described to you.” Narrated by Muslim in his Sahih.\n5.Belief in the Books: it is obligatory to believe in general terms that Allah, may He be glorified, sent down Books to His Prophets and Messengers to explain the truth and call people to it, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{We have already sent Our messengers with clear evidences and sent down with them the Scripture and the balance that the people may maintain [their affairs] in justice}[al-Hadid 57:25].\nWe believe in specific terms in those which Allah has mentioned by name, such as the Tawrat (Torah), the Injil (Gospel), the Zabur (Psalms) and the Qur’an.\nThe Holy Qur’an is the best of them and the last of them, and it supersedes them and confirms them. It is the one which all people are obliged to follow and refer to for judgement, along with what is soundly narrated from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) of the Sunnah, because Allah, may He be glorified, sent His Messenger Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) as a messenger to both races [humankind and the jinn], and He sent down to him this Qur’an so that he might judge between them according to it. He has made it a healing for what is in their hearts, and an explanation for all things, guidance and mercy for the believers, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And this [Qur'an] is a Book We have revealed [which is] blessed, so follow it and fear Allah that you may receive mercy}[al-An‘am 6:155].\n6.Belief in the Messengers: it is obligatory to believe in the Messengers in general terms and in specific terms. Hence we believe that Allah, may He be exalted, sent to His slaves Messengers from among them, as bringers of glad tidings and warners, and as callers to the truth. Whoever responds to their call will attain bliss, and whoever goes against them will incur loss and regret. The last and best of the Messengers is our Prophet Muhammad ibn ‘Abdillah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), as Allah, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And We certainly sent into every nation a messenger, [saying], “Worship Allah and shun false gods”}[an-Nahl 16:36].\nWith regard to those whom Allah has mentioned by name, or their names are soundly narrated from the Messenger of Allah, we believe in them in specific terms, such as Nuh, Hud, Salih, Ibrahim and others – blessings and peace of Allah be upon them and upon our Prophet.\n7.Belief in the Last Day. Belief in the Last Day includes believing in everything that Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) have told us about what will happen after death, such as the trial and punishment or bliss in the grave, and what will happen on the Day of Resurrection of terrors, hardships, the sirat, the balance, the reckoning, requital, and the distribution of the records among the people, when some will receive their record in their right hands and others will receive their records in their left hands or behind their backs. That also includes believing in the cistern of our Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to which people will come, and believing in Paradise and Hell, and believing that the believers will see their Lord, may He be glorified, and He will speak to them, and other things that are mentioned in the Qur’an and soundly narrated in the sahih Sunnah from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). We must believe in all of that and affirm it in the manner in which Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) have explained it.\n8.Belief in the divine decree. Believing in the divine decree includes believing in four things: Allah’s knowledge, His writing all things in al-Lawh al-Mahfuz, creation and the divine will. For more details on that, please see the answers to questions 34732 , 49004 and 20806 .\n9.Believing in Allah also includes believing that faith consists of words and deeds, and it increases by doing righteous deeds and decreases by committing sins; and that it is not permissible to deem any Muslim to be a disbeliever for committing any sin that is less than shirk or disbelief, such as zina, theft, consuming riba, consuming intoxicants, defiantly disobeying parents, and other major sins, so long as he does not regard those things as permissible, because Allah says:\n{Indeed, Allah does not forgive association with Him, but He forgives what is less than that for whom He wills}[an-Nisa’ 4:48].\nAnd it is proven in the mutawatir hadiths narrated from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that Allah will bring forth from the Fire anyone who has in his heart faith the size of a mustard seed.\n10.Part of believing in Allah is loving for the sake of Allah, hating for the sake of Allah, taking some people as allies for the sake of Allah, and taking others as enemies for the sake of Allah. So the believer loves the believers and regards them as allies, and he hates the disbelievers and regards them as enemies.\nForemost among the believers of this ummah are the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Ahl as-Sunnah wa’l-Jama‘ah love them and regard them as allies, and they believe that they are the best of people after the Prophets, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The best of people are my generation, then those who come after them, then those who come after them.” Sahih – agreed upon.\nThey believe that the best of them are: Abu Bakr as-Siddiq, then ‘Umar al-Faruq, then ‘Uthman Dhu’n-Nurayn, then ‘Ali al-Murtada (may Allah be pleased with them all). After them come the rest of the ten who were given the glad tidings of Paradise, then the rest of the Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them all). They refrain from discussing the disputes that arose among the Sahabah, and they believe that in that case each of them was striving to reach the right conclusion and make the right decision; whoever got it right will have two rewards and whoever got it wrong will have one reward. They love the family members of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) who believed in him, and they regard them as allies. They regard as allies the wives of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon them), the Mothers of the Believers, and they pray that Allah be pleased with all of them.\nThey reject the way of the Rafidis who hate and revile the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and exaggerate about the members of the Prophet’s family (Ahl al-Bayt), raising them to a status higher than that which Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, bestowed upon them. They also reject the way of the Nasibis who revile Ahl al-Bayt in words or deeds.\n11.Everything that we have mentioned above is the sound ‘aqidah (belief or creed) with which Allah sent His Messenger Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). It is the creed of the saved group, Ahl as-Sunnah wa’l-Jama‘ah, concerning which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “A group of my ummah will continue to adhere to the path of truth and they and they will continue to prevail, and they will not be harmed by those who forsake them, until the decree of Allah comes to pass.” And he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The Jews split into seventy-one groups, and the Christians split into seventy-two groups. This ummah will split into seventy-three groups, all of whom will be in the Fire except one.” The Sahabah said: Who are they, O Messenger of Allah? He said: “Those who follow that which I and my companions follow.” This is the ‘aqidah and sound creed to which we must adhere and remain steadfast therein, and we must beware of anything that goes against it.\n12.As for those who deviate from this ‘aqidah and follow the opposite, they are of many kinds. Among them are those who worship idols, images, angels, the awliya’ (“saints”; close friends of Allah), the jinn, trees, rocks and so on. Those people have not responded to the call of the Messengers; rather they have gone against them and stubbornly rejected them, as Quraysh and other Arabs did with our Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him); they used to ask their objects of worship to meet their needs, heal the sick and grant them victory over their enemies, and they used to offer sacrifices to them and make vows to them. When the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) rebuked them for that, and instructed them to devote worship sincerely to Allah alone, they found that odd and rejected it, and they said:\n{“Has he made the gods [only] one God? Indeed, this is a curious thing”}[Sad 38:5].\nThen circumstances changed, and ignorance prevailed over most people until the majority have gone back to the religion of the Jahiliyyah, exaggerating about the Prophets and the awliya’, calling upon them, seeking their help and other kinds of shirk (associating others with Allah). They do not understand the true meaning of La ilaha illa Allah (there is no god worthy of worship except Allah) as even the disbelievers among the Arabs understood it. This shirk continued to spread among the people until the present day, because of the prevalence of ignorance, and because we are so far from the era of prophethood.\n13.One of the kinds of creeds based on disbelief that are opposed to sound ‘aqidah and opposed to the message of the Messengers (blessings and peace of Allah be upon them) is what the atheists believe in nowadays, namely the followers of Marx, Lenin and others who promote atheism and disbelief, regardless of whether they call that socialism or communism or Baathism or any other names. One of the basic principles of these atheists is that there is no God and life is purely materialistic. Other basic principles of theirs include denial of the resurrection, denial of paradise and hell, and disbelief in all religions. Anyone who examines and studies their books will realise that for sure. Undoubtedly this creed is opposed to all the divinely-revealed religions and will lead its followers to the worst consequences in this world and the hereafter.\n14.Another kind of creed that is opposed to the truth is what some esoterics (batinis) and some Sufis believe in, that some of those whom they call awliya’ (“saints” or “holy men”) share control with Allah, directing the affairs of the universe. They call them by titles such as aqtab, awtad, aghwath and other names that they have fabricated for their gods. This is one of the most reprehensible types of associating others with Allah in His Lordship, and it is worse than the shirk of the Arabian Jahiliyyah, because the disbelieving Arabs did not associate others with Allah in His Lordship; rather they associated others with Him in their worship, and they did that at times of ease, but at times of hardship, they devoted their worship sincerely to Allah alone, as Allah, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{\xa0And when they board a ship, they supplicate Allah , sincere to Him in religion. But when He delivers them to the land, at once they associate others with Him}[al-‘Ankabut 29:65].\nWith regard to divine Lordship, they acknowledged that it belongs to Allah alone, as He, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And if you asked them who created them, they would surely say, “Allah”}[az-Zukhruf 43:87]\n{Say, “Who provides for you from the heaven and the earth? Or who controls hearing and sight and who brings the living out of the dead and brings the dead out of the living and who arranges [every] matter?” They will say, “Allah,” so say, “Then will you not fear Him?”}[Yunus 10:31].\nAnd there are many similar verses.\n15.Among the creeds that are opposed to sound Islamic ‘aqidah regarding the divine names and attributes are the beliefs of the innovators such as the Jahamis, Mu‘tazilah and others who followed their way in denying the attributes of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, and denying His attributes of perfection, and they ascribed to Him, may He be glorified and exalted, attributes of non-existent beings, inanimate beings and impossible beings – exalted be Allah far above what they say.\nThat also includes those who deny some of the divine attributes and affirm others, such as the Ash‘aris, who should have applied the same argument as they applied to the attributes that they affirmed to the attributes that they denied and interpreted in a manner other than what was indicated by the apparent meaning. Thus they went against both the textual evidence and the rational evidence, and contradicted themselves.\nSummarised from the essay al-‘Aqidah as-Sahihah wa ma yudaduha by Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him).\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/108579/a-brief-look-at-issues-of-sound-aqidah-belief-creed-for-muslims-and-the-false-beliefs-that-are-their-opposites
