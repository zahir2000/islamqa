114798,"My father used to work for an insurance company. When he started working for this company, he was not aware that working for insurance companies is prohibited, but he found out that working for them is prohibited when he reached the age of fifty. But despite that, he did not leave this job. Now my father is sixty-seven years old. He reached the age of retirement seven years ago, but despite that he is still working, without a salary but on commission. He intends to leave this job at the end of this year. I have advised him many times, but he says to me: I will leave this job soon. I want to explain to you that my father dealt with the money that he earned from his company in the following manner: in the beginning, he deposited it in interest-bearing account, then after that he took it and invested it in a construction project (a halal project). After explaining this, I hope that you could kindly answer the following questions: Is this money halal or haram, or is it mixed wealth? – Is it permissible for me and my siblings and my mother to make use of this wealth, even though I am working and receive a modest salary which, praise be to Allah, enables me to support myself? – My father spends on us and he intends, by Allah’s leave, to give me and each of my siblings an apartment to live in and some of his money; can I accept the apartment and the money, or should I refuse?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe commercial insurance contracts that are well known and widespread throughout the world are undoubtedly haram, and contrary to Islamic teachings, because they are contracts that are based on ambiguity and gambling, and some types are imposed on people by force of law and they enter into them unwillingly. These types of contracts combine many evils, so it is no wonder that the scholars unanimously state that they are prohibited, and any dissenting view is to be deemed odd and carries no weight.\nSecondly:\nWith regard to your father’s job and earnings from working for the insurance company, we remind him first of all to fear Allah, may He be exalted, because he is approaching the age of seventy, and he is still working in a job which he knows is haram and that it is not permissible for him to remain in it. When will he fear his Lord and give up deeds that incur Allah’s wrath? Can he guarantee that he will live until the end of the year, so as to justify his persisting in this haram type of work? How can he be content with himself, having reached this age, knowing that his life could end whilst he is persisting in disobeying his Lord, may He be exalted? A man such as him should be in his neighbourhood mosque, praying, reading Qur’an and offering supplication; he should be in the Haram, doing ‘umrah and observing i‘tikaf, focusing on worshipping Allah. He should not be working in companies that are based on gambling, and his main concern should not be how to attract and retain customers. We ask Allah, may He be exalted, to guide him soon and to enable him to spend what remains of his life doing the best of what his Lord loves.\nWith regard to the money that he earned from doing this unlawful work: whatever he earned before he realised that his work is haram is permissible for him, both the salary received during that period and any bonuses. Whatever he earned after he realised that it is haram is haram for him, both the salary received during that period and any bonuses.\nThe scholars of the Permanent Committee for Ifta’ said in one of their answers:\nRegarding the period that you spent working in the bank, we hope that Allah will forgive you the sin thereof, and with regard to whatever cash you accumulated and received as a result of working in the bank in the past, there is no sin on you for that, if you were unaware of the ruling thereon.\nShaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baz, Shaykh ‘Abd ar-Razzaq ‘Afifi, Shaykh ‘Abdullah ibn Ghadyan, Shaykh ‘Abdullah ibn Qa‘ud.\nFatawa al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah (15/46).\nThis fatwa applies to anyone who works in a haram field and is unaware of the ruling thereon, or who was told by someone whom he trusted that it is permissible. But that solution is subject to a condition that your father did not fulfil, which is giving up the job and not persisting in it. Allah, may He be exalted, has made giving up the haram activity a condition for previous earnings to be permissible.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{So whoever has received an admonition from his Lord and desists may have what is past}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:275].\nShaykh al-‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nOne of the things we learned from this verse is that whatever a person received of riba before coming to know that it is prohibited is permissible for him, on condition that he repents and desists.\'(Tafsir Surat al-Baqarah\xa0 3/377).\nSomething similar was stated by the scholars of the Permanent Committee. See their fatwa in the answer to question no. 106610 .\nHowever, after he came to know of the prohibition, his earnings are not permissible for him, because the work itself is haram.\nThirdly:\nWith regard to his wife and children who are sponsored by the one who earned haram wealth through haram work, there is no blame on them for what he spends on them. Rather the sin and prohibition apply to the one who acquired that wealth, and no one else. From this we may learn the reason why the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) accepted invitations from the Jews and ate their food, despite the fact that they acquired wealth through unlawful means.\nShaykh Muhammad ibn Salih al-‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\nMy father – may Allah forgive him – works in a riba-based bank. What is the ruling on us accepting his money and eating and drinking what is bought with his money? But we have another income, from my older sister who is working. Should we not accept maintenance from my father and accept maintenance from my older sister, even though we are a large family, or is my sister not obliged to spend on us, so we should accept maintenance from my father?\nHe replied:\nI say: accept what your father spends on you; you can enjoy it, and the consequences of earning it are to be borne by him, because you are receiving the money from your father lawfully, as he has wealth and you do not have wealth. Thus you are receiving it lawfully, and it is your father who is incurring the trouble of acquiring it and the sin of doing so, and he will bear the consequences, so that does not concern you. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) accepted gifts from the Jews, ate the food of the Jews, and bought from the Jews, even though the Jews are known for dealing in riba and consuming unlawful wealth. But the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) ate in a permissible manner, because if the food is acquired in a permissible manner, there is nothing wrong with it.\nFor example, look at the story of Barirah, the freed slave woman of ‘A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with them both): some meat was given in charity to her, then the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) entered his house one day and found the pot on the fire, so he called for food, but he was not given any meat; he was given some food in which there was no meat, so he said: “Did I not see the pot on the fire?” They said: Yes indeed, O Messenger of Allah, but it was meat that was given in charity to Barirah – and the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not eat any food that was given in charity. He said: “It is charity for her and a gift to us,” and he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) ate, even though it was prohibited for him to eat that which was given in charity, because he did not receive it as charity; rather he received it as a gift.\nSo to these brothers we say: Eat from your father’s wealth and enjoy it, and the sin and consequences thereof are to be borne by your father, unless Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, guides him and he repents, for whoever repents, Allah will turn to him in mercy.""(Al-Liqa’ ash-Shahri\xa0 45/question no. 16).\nThe ruling on this mixed wealth is that whatever you are given of it, you may consume and enjoy it, whether it is cash or otherwise, such as an apartment or land.\nWhatever he leaves behind after he dies, you should look and see if there is anyone who is the rightful owner of wealth that your father leaves behind, from whom it was taken unlawfully, then you must give it back to him. If it has no owner, or you cannot find the owner, then spend that amount on charitable causes. This applies to wealth that is haram in and of itself. As for that which is haram because of the way in which it was earned, it is haram for him but not for you. It is permissible for you, as noted above in the words of Shaykh al-‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him), unless you want to be extra cautious, in which case you may spend it on charitable causes, but this is not a must.\nShaykh al-Islam (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about one who dealt in riba and died, leaving behind wealth and a son, who was aware of his father’s situation. Is it permissible for the son to inherit or not?\n[He replied:] As for the amount that the son knows was earned through riba, he must dispose of it, either by returning it to its rightful owners, if possible, or by giving it in charity. The remainder of the wealth is not haram for him.\nBut with regard to the amount concerning which there is some doubt, it is recommended to refrain from taking it, if he does not need it to pay off a debt or spend on his dependents. But if the father acquired it through riba-based transactions for which some of the jurists granted concessions, it is permissible for the heir to make use of it. If the halal portion of the wealth is mixed with that which is haram, and the proportion of each is not known, then he should divide it into two halves.""(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa\xa0 29/307).\nThe scholars of the Permanent Committee said:\nIt is not permissible for the father to spend on his children’s maintenance wealth that was acquired in unlawful ways. This is well known to the questioner. As for the children, there is no sin on them for that; rather the sin is borne by their father.\nIf the entire house was acquired through theft, then what the heirs must do is return what was stolen to its owners, if they are known. If they are not known, then that must be spent on charitable causes, for building and renovating mosques, and it should be given in charity to the poor, with the intention that it is on behalf of the owner of the stolen wealth. This is also the ruling if part of the house was built with stolen wealth and part of it was built with the grandfather’s wealth. The heirs should return the equivalent of what was stolen to its owners, if they are known, otherwise they must spend that wealth on charitable causes, as noted above.\nShaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baz, Shaykh ‘Abd ar-Razzaq ‘Afifi, Shaykh ‘Abdullah ibn Ghadyan, Shaykh ‘Abdullah ibn Qa‘ud.\nFatawa al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah (26/332).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/114798/rulings-on-wealth-that-is-haram-because-of-the-way-in-which-it-is-acquired-and-is-haram-in-and-of-itself-and-on-children-benefitting-from-it-and-inheriting-it
223615,"I heard a hadith which says that a man came to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and said: How much I have sinned! And the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) told him: “Say: O Allah, surely Your forgiveness is greater than my sins and I have great hope in Your mercy, so, O Lord, forgive me” – and he told him to repeat it three times. What are the supplications for forgiveness from sins? What are the supplications that will strengthen faith and ward off intrusive thoughts (waswasah)?","[""Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIn the answers to questions no. 3177 and 39775 , we have listed a number of supplications having to do with repentance and seeking forgiveness.\nSecondly:\nFaith increases by doing acts of worship and righteous deeds, and it decreases by committing sins. So whoever wants to increase his faith, let him focus on obeying Allah and let him avoid disobeying Him. What will help him to do that is spending time with righteous people and keeping away from innovators and sinners.\nAmong the most important means that will help the Muslim to do that are the following:\n*Offering supplication and asking Allah to make you steadfast in adhering to His religion:\nAllah, may He be exalted, tells us that the people of knowledge and faith say: (interpretation of the meaning):\n{[Who say], “Our Lord, let not our hearts deviate after You have guided us and grant us from Yourself mercy. Indeed, You are the Bestower”}[Aal ‘Imran 3:8].\nAhmad narrated in al-Musnad (23463) that ‘A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) often used to say in his supplication: “Ya muqallib al-quloob thabbit qalbi 'ala deenik (O Controller of the hearts, make my heart adhere firmly to Your religion).” I said: O Messenger of Allah, how often you offer this supplication. He said: “Man’s heart is between two of the fingers of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted; if He wills, He causes it to deviate, and if He wills, He causes it to be guided.” At-Tirmidhi narrated it from Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) and classed it as hasan. It was also classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih at-Tirmidhi.\n*At-Tirmidhi (3599) narrated – and classed it as hasan – that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Allahumm anfa‘ni bima ‘allamtani wa ‘allimni ma yanfa‘uni wa zidni ‘ilma (O Allah, benefit me by means of that which You have taught me, and teach me that which will benefit me, and increase me in knowledge).” Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih at-Tirmidhi. Whomever Allah increases in knowledge, his faith will grow stronger.\nAhmad (3797) narrated from Ibn Mas‘ud (may Allah be pleased with him) that he was in the mosque, offering supplication, and that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came in whilst he was offering supplication. He said: “Ask, you will be given,” when he [Ibn Mas‘ud] was saying: O Allah, I ask You for faith that does not waver, blessing that does not end and to accompany the Prophet (sa) in the highest station in Paradise, the Paradise of eternity. Whomever Allah gives faith that does not waver is strong in faith, and it will not be weakened by desires or doubts.\n*Asking Allah, may He be exalted, for guidance\nMuslim (2725) narrated that ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to me: “Say: Allahumm ahdini wa saddidni (O Allah, guide me and make me steadfast).\nMuslim (2721) also narrated from Ibn Mas‘ud (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to say: “Allahumma inni as’aluk al-huda wa’t-tuqa wa’l-‘afafa wa’l-ghina (O Allah, I ask You for guidance, piety, abstinence and independence of means).”\n*Offering concise supplications, asking Allah for all that is good and seeking refuge with Him from all that is bad, as Ibn Majah (3846) narrated from ‘A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) taught her the following supplication: “Allahumma inni as’aluka min al-khayri kullihi, ‘ajilihi wa ajilihi, ma ‘alimtu minhu wa ma lam a’lam. Wa a‘udhu bika min ash-sharri kullihi, ‘ajilihi wa ajilihi, ma ‘alimtu minhu wa ma lam a’lam. Allahumma inni as’aluka min khayri ma sa’alaka ‘abduka wa nabiyyuka, wa a‘udhu bika min sharri ma ‘adha bihi ‘abduka wa nabiyyuka. Allahumma inni as’aluka al-jannata wa ma qarraba ilayha min qawlin aw ‘amal, wa a‘udhu bika min al-naari wa ma qarraba ilayha min qawlin aw ‘amal, wa as’aluka an taj‘al kulla qadaa’in qadaytahu li khayran (O Allah, I ask You for all that is good, now and in the future, what I know of it and what I do not know. And I seek refuge with You from all evil, now and in the future, what I know and what I do not know.\xa0 O Allah, I ask You for the good that Your slave and Prophet asked You for, and I seek refuge with You from the evil from which Your slave and Prophet sought refuge. O Allah, I ask You for Paradise and for that which brings one closer to it, in word and deed, and I seek refuge in You from Hell and from that which brings one closer to it, in word and deed. And I ask You to make every decree that You decree concerning me good).” Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah.\n*Asking Allah, may He be exalted, to renew faith in our hearts. Al-Hakim (5) narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘As (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Faith wears out in the heart of one of you as a garment wears out, so ask Allah to renew faith in your hearts.” Classed as hasan by al-Albani in as-Sahihah (1585).\nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 14041 .\nThirdly:\nThe remedy for intrusive thoughts (waswas) is to ignore them and turn away from them; to recite a great deal of Qur’an; to do great deal of righteous deeds; and to call upon Allah, may He be glorified, and beseech Him to ward off the schemes of the Shaytan from you and to make you steadfast in adhering to the truth.\nSee also the answer to question no. 102851 .\nSupplications that are beneficial in warding off the intrusive whispers of the Shaytan (waswas) include the following:\n*Seeking refuge with Allah from him. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And if an evil suggestion comes to you from Satan, then seek refuge in Allah. Indeed, He is Hearing and Knowing}[al-A‘raf 7:200].\n*Asking Allah for protection from it. Ibn Majah (773) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When any one of you enters the mosque, let him send salaams upon the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), then let him say, Allahumm aftah li abwaba rahmatika (O Allah, open to me the gates of Your mercy). And when he leaves let him send salaams upon the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and say Allahumm i‘simni min ash-shaytan ir-rajeem (O Allah, protect me from the accursed Shaytan).” Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah.\n*Seeking refuge with Allah from the incitements of the devils, lest they be present with one:\n{And say, “My Lord, I seek refuge in You from the incitements of the devils\nAnd I seek refuge in You, my Lord, lest they be present with me”}[al-Mu’minoon 23:97-98].\n*Asking Allah to subdue the Shaytan. Abu Dawud (5054) narrated from Abu’l-Azhar al-Anmari (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Bismillahi wada‘tu janbi. Allahumm ighfir li dhanbi wa akhsi’ shaytani wa fukka rihani waj‘alni fi’n-nadiyy il-a‘la (In the name of Allah I lay down on my side. O Allah, forgive me my sins, drive away my shaytaan, help me to fulfil my obligations and join me with the highest assembly).” Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud.\nFourthly:\nThe hadith mentioned in the question is a da‘if (weak) hadith. It was narrated by al-Hakim in al-Mustadrak (1944) via ‘Ubaydullah ibn Muhammad ibn Hunayn: ‘Ubaydullah ibn Muhammad ibn Jabir ibn ‘Abdillah told me, from his father, from his grandfather, who said: A man came to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and said: How much I have sinned, how much I have sinned! – he said these words two or three times. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to him: “Say: O Allah, surely Your forgiveness is greater than my sins and my hope in Your mercy is great er than my hope in my deeds.” The man said it, then [the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)] said: “Say it again,” so he said it again. Then he said: “Say it again,” so he said it again. Then he said: “Get up, for Allah has forgiven you.” Al-Albani classed this hadith as da‘if in Silsilat al-Ahadith ad-Da‘ifah (9/58).\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/223615/supplications-to-strengthen-faith-and-ward-off-intrusive-thoughts-waswasah
