112018,"I have some questions to which I would like to find a satisfactory answer that will help me in my research. Recently it has become common in online discussion boards to use anime images (depicting animate beings). What are the means of combating this phenomena, noting that people are very fond of them and love them, especially young women? What are the possible alternatives?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nNo wise person would doubt the impact that animated cartoons have on children, and it is an impact that becomes more intense because of the attractive way they are presented and because of lack of restraint. The means by which these cartoons are shown are very powerful and exciting, to the extent that there are many adults who are infatuated by them, in addition to the lack of restraint that would prevent children from watching them, such as mature thinking and strong belief. Hence if you asked anyone who watched these cartoons when he was very young, he will be able to tell you a lot about the stories and events as if he can see them with his own eyes now. Think about how much is imprinted on children’s minds of images that promote a particular belief or teach a particular behaviour. Whoever reflects on the true nature of these cartoons [and what they promote] will realise the great danger that they pose to children and even adults.\nThe newspaper al-Jazirah (issue no. 12321, Friday 27 Jumada al-Ula 1427 AH) reported on an academic study undertaken by the researcher Huda al-Ghufays which deals with the impact of cartoons on the child at different stages of his life. Among other things, it says in this paper:\nAn academic study has warned of the dangers of imported cartoons on the faith of Muslim children, because of what they contain of deviant ideas aimed at undermining belief in the minds of young people and has affirmed how important it is to consolidate efforts to reform TV channels and satellite channels, in order to protect our youth from the conspiracy against them, for the matter is no longer hidden.\nThe study indicated that an ideological war has been launched against Islam and its people, aimed primarily at the faith of Muslim children, the foundations of the religion, and belief in Allah, His Books and His Messengers.\nThe study discovered that the time when children start to become attached to media is the age of three for males and the age of five for females. This is the most critical stage in the child’s development and in the formation of his ideas and beliefs.\nThe study shows that a high percentage of mothers are unaware of whether or not cartoons can play a role in instilling sound belief or otherwise in children, as 75% of those who were included in the study were not certain about the impact of cartoons in building the child’s creed (‘aqidah). This is indicative of an urgent need to rethink what children watch, and confirms the serious impact that cartoons have on building the child’s imagination and way of thinking, which leads to developing convictions that have a serious influence on the child’s psyche. Unfortunately, this issue – the issue of the impact that cartoons have on the child’s mind – despite the serious consequences that may result from that, has not been discussed in an appropriate manner which reflects the grievous danger that our children are facing. End quote.\nSecondly:\nThose who are in charge of the Muslim media must fear Allah, may He be exalted, with regard to the children of the Muslims. They must realise that they are taking part, through their media, in the destruction of society and in the spread of immorality, violence and corruption. They were not content only to corrupt young men and women, and adult men and women, with movies, plays and songs; now they have added to their dreadful track record things that will corrupt the beliefs and morals of children by means of what they import from the doomed East or the corrupt West of programs and cartoons for children which play a role in ruining and corrupting them.\nThirdly:\nSome of the means that we advise parents and those in authority to use in order to combat this assault on our children and ward it off are as follows:\n1.\xa0Focus on teaching children to memorise the Book of Allah, may He be exalted, and to make the best use of their youthful energy and willingness to learn for that purpose.\n2.\xa0Teach them to love the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his Companions by teaching them their biography and life stories, choosing age-appropriate books for the children.\n3.\xa0Teaching them something about issues of creed (‘aqidah) in a simple and straightforward manner, such as the oneness of Allah and how to venerate Him, love Him and fear Him, and that He has power over all things, and that He is the Creator and Provider, and other things that are appropriate to their age and intellectual level.\n4.\xa0Teaching them to denounce and hate evil, and teaching the child that he should not watch cartoons in which there is music or girls who are uncovered or crosses. Even if there is any character in the cartoon who drinks or eats without saying Bismillah, he should denounce that, and if he sees anyone stealing or killing, he should denounce that. Teaching him that before he watches anything will be beneficial, by Allah’s leave, because the child may see something shown on TV outside the family home, so he will hasten to turn it off and not watch it. There are interesting stories of children who have been raised in this manner, which have been a means of warding off a great deal of evil.\nSome of the alternatives to these cartoons that we may suggest are as follows:\n1.\xa0Similar cartoons should be produced that comply with Islamic guidelines and are free of evils, and which teach about virtues. There is no reason why they should not be the same cartoons, edited to remove the evils, and with the characters playing their roles using permissible words that do not go against Islamic teachings. The Majd channel did well when it used this method, as it has its own programs of cartoons, as well as beneficial dubbing of famous cartoons. Thus this will combine the aim of fulfilling the child’s desire for entertainment with the aim of teaching him some proper behaviour and good manners.\nShaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\nNow there are some Islamic recordings and cartoons, which say that they are Islamic – meaning that they have produced some movies such as the Conquest of Constantinople, or Peace Journey. Recently there has appeared the Boy of Najran, telling a story that is mentioned in Surat al-Buruj and in the hadith narrated in Sahih Muslim. This is a cartoon which has been produced as an alternative to corrupt cartoons. What is the ruling on that?\nHe replied:\nI think, in sha Allah, that there is nothing wrong with this, because in reality – as you said – it protects children from watching haram things. At the very least, even if we are strict about it, it is less serious than other cartoons, meaning – as we have heard – the type in which they try to shed doubts on faith and belief, and which depict the Almighty – Allah forbid – when He sends down rain, and the like. Whatever the case, I do not think there is anything wrong with them…\nI think that if there is nothing but good in it, then there is nothing wrong with it, in sha Allah. But if they are accompanied by music, then they are not permissible, because music is haram.\nLiqa’at al-Bab al-Maftuh (127/question no. 10).\n2.\xa0Choosing educational programs which combine fun and learning. Such programs are becoming widespread, which incorporate sounds and images, and talk about the sea, animals, and so on. The Majd documentary channel is a very active contributor in this field, and its programs are free of music and women.\nThese cartoons and programs should be in accordance with Islamic guidelines. Sister Huda Ghufays has mentioned this in her research paper, and the al-Jazirah newspaper said, reporting on her research:\nThis study suggests some important guidelines that makers of children’s programs should adhere to and keep in mind, such as avoiding production of programs that create fear and terror in children, because they are at a stage where they are receptive to such things and they will have a great impact on them. That is because the child between the ages of two and five years is afraid of being alone, and he is afraid of fire and animals, and imaginary things such as ghosts and ‘ifrits. Depicting such things could lead to the child growing up with psychological problems.\nPrograms for children should focus on promoting good values and should not show a great deal of weeping and crying, because that only leads to a weak character that is unable to face challenges. Rather they should promote values within a framework of fun, with positive and happy stories and ideas.\nThe study confirms that children’s media should be based on knowledge and professionalism, and it should not be produced by immature people. We should pay attention to this aspect of media production, which is based on knowledge, skills and art. We should not go to extremes in using our imagination, because this will have a great impact on children’s way of conceiving things; rather we should allow that within certain limits.\nThe study confirms that it is essential to analyse the impact of cartoons which claim to be in accordance with Islamic standards, to ensure that the purpose behind these productions is not mere entertainment and creating alternatives. We should be aware of the Islamic alternatives that are produced for children, because it seems that most of what is produced as alternatives focuses on avoiding that which goes against Islamic teachings, but they neglect another important aspect, which is how these movies could help to instil Islamic beliefs, in accordance with a well-prepared plan that is appropriate to the age of the audience. It is essential that specialists in Islamic knowledge should fiercely confront campaigns that are aimed at corrupting the minds and faith of our youth. End quote.\n3.\xa0We should occupy our children’s time with some beneficial and healthy activities, in which they can play sports, swim and engage in other permissible games. This will combine fun with benefits, provided that we choose the right sports clubs and choose good friends for our children to play with.\n4.\xa0Children can also watch some Islamic websites which have some sections for children, showing them useful clips, games or cartoons about the stories of the Prophets and the righteous, and stories of battles and campaigns in Islamic history. The ash-Shabakah al-Islamiyyah website has a special section for children which is very beneficial.\nAs you will notice, we do not deal with children as we deal with adults. So it must be noted that we urge parents to try to satisfy the child’s desire to watch movies and play, but at the same time we should not let things get out of control, lest we find ourselves going against Islamic teachings and so that the child does not become corrupt and accustomed to evil, and cause trouble to us when he grows up. Hence we urge companies and organisations who are able to produce useful content for children with sound and images not to spare any effort in that, for the children are in the greatest need of that, and parents are also in great need of a beneficial and fun alternative to show to their children. We think it is essential to produce something especially for girls, so that our daughters will be raised to be modest and lower their gaze from an early age.\nSister Huda al-Ghufays also referred in her paper to some things that are useful in this regard.\nIn the article in the al-Jazirah newspaper which reports on her research it says:\nWith regard to the negative impact of the media and how to remedy it, the study indicates that we should adopt an educational method aimed at instilling faith, focusing on spiritual well-being and strengthening belief, so as to prevent or reduce these negative impacts. The study listed some of these negative impacts and how to find a solution to them:\n1.\xa0Showing a lot of media interviews with football stars, pop stars, movie stars and other celebrities, focusing on their lives and parties and presenting them as examples for children to follow. The study suggests that parents should make the child aware of the example of the Messenger of Allah and encourage the child to take him as an example to be followed, by presenting the Sirah (biography) of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in a story that the child can connect with.\n2.\xa0The child memorising the names of characters in cartoons, and asking to dress like them. The solution to that is to encourage the child to imitate the way the Prophet and Sahabah, and other historical heroes of the Muslims, lived.\n3.\xa0The child readily accepts ideas that are not in accordance with our beliefs. The solution recommended by the study is to strengthen the child’s spiritual immunity, by teaching him the Book of Allah and encouraging him to spend time studying it, and striving to connect the child to the Qur’an in all aspects of life.\n4.\xa0Undermining the child’s pride in being a Muslim; that is because the child is not raised to love Islam and is not made aware of how great it is to be a Muslim. The solution to this issue is to continually highlight the merits of Islam, making the most of special occasions to do that, and comparing Islam to other religions. We should feel a sense of responsibility, and be sincere and truthful in fulfilling the trust as is required of us.

170751,"A young man of good character proposed marriage to me, and I agreed, and we set a date for the engagement, but nothing was done officially. All that happened was that my brother gave him the answer, and his mother came to visit us. At the same time, another young man proposed marriage to me who is of better character than him, and I felt more comfortable with the new suitor. I felt more at ease with him than with the first one. If I agree to marry the second suitor, will I have committed any sin? Please note that I was not completely convinced about the first one.","['Praise be to Allah.Before answering your question, we must first say something having to do with the second suitor: it is not permissible for anyone to propose to a woman to whom his brother [in faith] has already proposed.\nIt was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade outbidding [or undercutting] one another and forbade a man proposing to a woman to whom his brother [in faith] has already proposed, unless the suitor before him gives up the idea or gives him permission [to propose to her]. Narrated by al-Bukhari (4848) and Muslim (1412).\nBut if it so happens that more than one suitor proposes to a woman, because the second suitor, for example, was not aware of the first one, or for some other reason, then there is no blame on the woman for choosing the one who is best suited for her, even if he is the second one.\nIt is soundly narrated in the Sunnah that Mu‘awiyah and Abu Jahm both proposed to Fatimah bint Qays, and when she consulted the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), he advised her to marry a third man, namely Usamah ibn Zayd (may Allah be pleased with him).\nMuslim (1480) narrated from Fatimah bint Qays (may Allah be pleased with her) that she came to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and told him: Mu‘awiyah ibn Abi Sufyan and Abu Jahm have both proposed to me. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “As for Abu Jahm, he is a man who beats women. As for Mu‘aawiyah, he is a poor man who has no wealth. Marry Usaamah ibn Zayd.”\nSo there is no blame on you for accepting the second one and rejecting the first one. The choice should be based on Islamic guidelines. In the answer to question no. 5202 , you will find a description of the ideal Muslim husband.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/170751/a-second-suitor-proposed-to-her-after-the-first-one-is-she-sinning-if-she-accepts-his-proposal
122622,"In a mudarabah partnership, the profits are divided between the financier [investor] and the worker [the one who is running the business] according to the ratio agreed upon between them. My question is: is it permissible, according to Islamic teachings, for the two parties to agree that the worker is to be paid a fixed monthly salary in addition to his agreed-upon share of the profits?","['Praise be to Allah.Mudarabah is a partnership contract between the financier who provides the capital and the worker who runs the business with that capital. One of the conditions stipulated in order for this mudarabah to be valid is that the capital is not to be guaranteed, and the financier is not to be given a specific amount; rather he is entitled to a share of the profits according to what the two parties have agreed upon, and the worker who runs the business with that capital agrees to take in return for his work a percentage as agreed upon between him and the financier.\nHence the scholars are unanimously agreed that it is not permissible for him to take a fixed amount (salary) in return for his work, in addition to his share of the profits, because there may be no profit from the money invested except what he receives as a salary, in which case he will be the only one to gain some profits, to the exclusion of the financier. If he also contributed some capital to the project, then he may receive something in return for his work, if he does the work himself, and the same applies to his partner. This is what we say, and we do not know of anyone among the scholars who disagreed with that.\nThere follow some scholarly views discussing the conditions of mudarabah, highlighting the fact that what is mentioned in the question about the worker receiving a monthly salary is one of the things that invalidate this contract.\n\nShaykh Sayyid Sabiq (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n\nThe following conditions are stipulated in the case of a mudarabah contract:\n1.\xa0The capital should be in the form of currency [gold or silver coins, or cash]. If it is in the form of raw metal, jewellery or trade goods, then it is not valid. Ibn al-Mundhir said: All of those from whom we acquired knowledge are unanimously agreed that it is not permissible for any man to turn money owed to him by another man into capital for investment. End quote.\n2.\xa0The amount of the capital should be known, so as to distinguish the capital that is invested in the business from the profits that will be shared between the two partners according to the agreement.\n3.\xa0The profit should be shared between the worker and the financier according to a known ratio, such as half, one third, and one quarter, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) made a deal with the people of Khaybar that they would work the land in return for half of the yield.\nIbn al-Mundhir said: All of those from whom we acquired knowledge are unanimously agreed that the mudarabah contract becomes invalid if one or both of the partners sets aside for himself a known amount of dirhams. End quote.\nThe reason for that is that if it is stipulated that a specific amount should be given to one of them, the profit may turn out to be no more than this amount, in which case the one for whom it was stipulated will take it and the other will not receive anything, and this is contrary to the objective of the mudarabah partnership, in which the aim is that both parties should benefit.\n4.\xa0The mudarabah contract should be free of restrictions. This means that the financiers should not restrict the worker to trading only in a specific country, or trading only in a specific product, or only doing business at certain times and not others, or only dealing with one particular person, and other such conditions, because stipulating restrictions often defeats the purpose of the contract, which is to make a profit. So there should be no such conditions, otherwise the mudarabah contract becomes invalid.\nThis is the view of Malik and ash-Shafa‘i.\nAbu Hanifah and Ahmad, on the other hand, did not stipulate this condition. They said: As the mudarabah contract is valid when it is free of restrictions, it is also valid when there are restrictions.\n…\nIt is not one of the conditions of a mudarabah contract to stipulate its duration, because it is a permissible contract that may be annulled at any time. It is also not one of its conditions that it must be between a Muslim and another Muslim; rather it is valid for it to be between a Muslim and a dhimmi [non-Muslim living under Muslim rule].\nFiqh as-Sunnah (3/205-207).\n\nAl-Kasani al-Hanafi (may Allah have mercy on him) said, discussing the conditions of the mudarabah contract:\n\nOne of these conditions is that a percentage of the profit – one half or one third or one quarter – should be stipulated for both the worker and the financier. If they stipulate that a certain amount should be given, such as stipulating that one of them will have one hundred dirhams of the profits, or less, or more, and the rest should go to the other partner, that is not permissible and the mudarabah contract becomes invalid. That is because mudarabah is a type of partnership in which the partners share the profits, but this condition means that they will no longer be partners sharing the profits, because there is the possibility that the mudarabah project will not make more than this amount, in which case it will go to one of them and not the other, so it will no longer be a partnership and the deal will no longer be a mudarabah. The same applies if they stipulate that one of them should have half, or one third, plus one hundred dirhams or minus one hundred dirhams. This is not permissible, because mudarabah is a type of partnership in which the partners share the profits, but this condition means that they will no longer be partners sharing the profits, because there is the possibility that the mudarabah project will not make more than this amount, in which case it will go to one of them and not the other, so it will no longer be a partnership and the deal will no longer be a mudarabah.\nBada’i‘ as-Sana’i‘ (6/85, 86).\n\nAsh-Shirazi ash-Shafa‘i (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n\nIt is not permissible for one of them to stipulate that he will receive a certain amount of the profit and the rest is to be shared between them, because the business may not produce that amount of profit, so he will no longer be entitled to anything, or it may not make any profit except that amount, in which case the rights of the other partner will be lost.\nSee: al-Majmu‘ Sharh al-Muhadhdhab (14/366).\nConclusion: it is not permissible for the worker who does business with the capital in a mudarabah project to have a fixed monthly salary; he is not entitled to anything except the share agreed upon between him and the financier.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/122622/is-it-permissible-for-the-one-who-does-business-with-someone-elses-wealth-to-take-a-monthly-salary-from-the-invested-capital-and-some-of-the-conditions-for-doing-that
