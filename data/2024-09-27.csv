133116,"I and two other people tricked an insurance company with a fake accident. We had agreed amongst ourselves to share out the money, which is approximately 21,000, with each of us taking 7,000. I went and collected the cheque and cashed it, and I took 1,000 from it. What was left was 20,000, which the second guy took on the basis that he would divide it into three equal parts between us, then after that he denied that. I only took 1,000, and all ties between us have been cut off since that day. I have repented to Allah, and I want to return the money. Should I return only the amount that I took, which was only 1,000, or what?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nAllah, may He be exalted, has opened the gates of His mercy to people, and He has told us that whoever repents from sin, He will turn in mercy to him and forgive him his sin. He, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And whoever does a wrong or wrongs himself but then seeks forgiveness of Allah will find Allah Forgiving and Merciful}\n[an-Nisa’ 4:11]\n{Say, O My servants who have transgressed against themselves [by sinning], do not despair of the mercy of Allah. Indeed, Allah forgives all sins. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful}\n[az-Zumar 39:53].\nOne of the conditions of repentance, if the matter has to do with the rights of people, is that their rights should be restored to them.\nThe conditions of perfect, valid repentance are:\n\nGiving up the sin\nRegretting what has happened in the past\nResolving not to go back to it.\n\nIf repentance is from having wronged people with regard to their wealth or honour, then a fourth condition is added, namely:\n\nSeeking pardon from the one who was wronged, asking for his forgiveness or giving him what is rightfully his.\n\nSecondly:\nTricking anyone by means of deceit and cheating in order to take the wealth of others unlawfully is a major sin, and the one who does that has combined two grievous sins: taking money unlawfully, and deceiving and cheating.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {O you who have believed, do not consume one another’s wealth unjustly\xa0but only [in lawful] business by mutual consent…} [an-Nisa’ 4:29].\nIt was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever deceives (people) does not belong to me.” (Narrated by Muslim, 102).\nThirdly:\nIf the action of tricking and cheating the insurance company, on the basis of which they issued the cheque, was done with the participation of all of you, each according to his role, whether his role in the deceit was small or great, then you three should all carry the burden of your actions and your plan to share the ill-gotten money among you equally, regardless of in whose name the cheque was written, and also regardless of what each person actually got. Even if you did not take any of this money, and your friend cheated you and took it all, that was a separate act of betrayal, and your burden of sin is because you all tricked the insurance company and took its wealth.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf a group of people take part in killing a person, they must pay one diyah (blood money), a responsibility to be shared among them, because it is a payment for something that has been destroyed that can be divided, so the burden is to be shared among them, as in the case of a financial penalty. (End quote from al-Kafi (4/3).\nAl-Bahuti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf a group of people participate in killing a game animal [whilst they are in ihram], then they must offer one penalty, because it is a penalty for what they killed, which varies according to what animal was killed, and the penalty to be paid can be divided. So it is one penalty, as in the case of compensation paid for destroyed property or blood money (diyah). (End quote from Kash-shaf al-Qina`, 2/467).\nFourthly:\nDo you have to return the money that you owe to the insurance company, or can you spend it on charitable causes on the grounds that the activities and dealings of commercial insurance companies are prohibited? What appears to be the case is that the amount that you owe must be returned to them, and the fact that their activities are prohibited does not make it permissible to spend their wealth on charitable causes. Rather it must be returned to them, so that they can regain possession of it.\nShaykh Yusuf ash-Shubayli (may Allah preserve him) was asked:\nIs it permissible to trick insurance companies in order to receive compensation?\nHe replied:\nIt is not permissible to trick insurance companies by lying to them in order to take compensation unlawfully. If someone does that, the wealth that he takes is stolen wealth, which he must return to the company from which he took it. It is not valid to dispose of it by spending it on charitable causes; rather he must return it to the insurance company. (End quote from the shaykh’s website)\nFifthly:\nIt is not stipulated that the one who wants to return something to its rightful owners must disclose his identity, because the aim is to return the thing to its rightful owners.\nIf he is afraid of being charged, or he is concerned about the consequences of disclosing what he did, then he should look for an appropriate way that will enable him to maintain his dignity and restore the thing to its rightful owners, without bringing embarrassment upon himself. For example, he can send the money by mail, or delegate someone to deliver it, or he can deposit it in their account.\nSee also the answer to question no. 31234.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/133116/they-deceived-the-insurance-company-and-received-unlawful-money-from-them-what-should-the-one-who-has-repented-do
71236,"If a calamity befalls the Muslim in his health or his wealth, etc, what is the correct way of dealing with it according to Islam?","['Praise be to Allah.Calamities and disasters are a test\nCalamities and disasters are a test, and they are a sign of Allah’s love for a person, because they are like medicine: even though it is bitter, despite its bitterness you give it to the one whom you love – and for Allah is the highest description. In the authentic Hadith it says: “The greatest reward comes with the greatest trial. When Allah loves a people He tests them. Whoever accepts that wins His pleasure but whoever is discontent with that earns His wrath.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 2396 and Ibn Majah, 4031; classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Tirmidhi)\nAre calamities good for the believer?\nCalamities are good for the believer in the sense that reward is stored up for him the Hereafter thereby; how can it be otherwise when he is raised in status thereby and his bad deeds are expiated? The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When Allah wills good for His slave, He hastens the punishment for him in this world, and when Allah wills ill for His slave, he withholds the punishment for his sins from him until he comes with all his sins on the Day of Resurrection.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 2396; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Tirmidhi)\nAl-Hasan Al-Basri (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Do not resent the calamities that come and the disasters that occur, for perhaps in something that you dislike will be your salvation, and perhaps in something that you prefer will be your doom.”\nAl-Fadl ibn Sahl (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “There is a blessing in calamity that the wise man should not ignore, for it erases sins, gives one the opportunity to attain the reward for patience, dispels negligence, reminds one of blessings at the time of health, calls one to repent and encourages one to give charity.\nThrough calamity the believer seeks reward, and there is no way to attain it but through patience, and there is no way to be patient except with resolute faith and strong will.\nRemember the words of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “How wonderful is the affair of the believer, for his affairs are all good, and this applies to no one but the believer. If something good happens to him, he is thankful for it and that is good for him. If something bad happens to him, he bears it with patience and that is good for him.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2999)\nWhat to Say When Calamity Strikes You\nSo if calamity befalls a Muslim, he should say Inna Lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji`un (Verily to Allah we belong and unto Him is our return), and say the Du`a’s that have been narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).\nHow wonderful are those moments in which a person turns to his Lord and knows that He alone is the One Who grants relief from distress. How great is the relief when it comes after hardship. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{but give glad tidings to As- Sabirun (the patient). \xa0Who, when afflicted with calamity, say: ‘Truly, to Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return.’ They are those on whom are the Salawat (i.e. who are blessed and will be forgiven) from their Lord, and (they are those who) receive His Mercy, and it is they who are the guided ones.} [Al-Baqarah 2:155-157]\nMuslim (918) narrated that Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “There is no Muslim who is stricken with a calamity and says what Allah has enjoined – ‘Verily to Allah we belong and unto Him is our return. O Allah, reward me for my affliction and compensate me with something better’ – but Allah will compensate him with something better.”\nShe said: When Abu Salamah died, I said: Who among the Muslims is better than Abu Salamah, the first household to migrate to join the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)? Then I said it, and Allah compensated me with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).\nHow to deal with calamities\nThere are things which, if the one who is stricken with calamity thinks about them, that will make the calamity easier for him to bear.\nIn his valuable book Zad Al-Ma`ad (4/189-195), Ibn Al-Qayyim has mentioned several things, including the following:\n\nIf he looks at what has befallen him, he will find that what his Lord has left for him is similar to it or better than it, and if he is patient and accepts it, He has stored up for him something that is many times greater than what he has lost through this calamity, and if He willed He could have made the calamity even greater.\nThe fire of calamity can be extinguished by thinking of those who have been hit even harder. Let him look to his right, does he see anything but calamity? Then let him look to his left, does he see anything but loss? If he were to look at the people around him, he would not see anything but people who are tested, either by missing out on something that they like, or by having something happen to them that which they dislike. The pains of this world are like dreams or like a passing shadow. If you laugh a little you will weep a lot, and if you are happy for a day you will be miserable for a lifetime, and if you have what you want for a little while, you will be deprived for a long time. There is no day of happiness but it is followed by a day of pain. Ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: For every moment of joy there is a moment of sorrow, and no house is filled with joy but it will be filled with sorrow. And Ibn Sirin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: There is never any laughter but there comes weeping after it.\nIt should be noted that panicking will not make the calamity go away, and in fact it makes it worse.\nIt should be noted that missing out on the reward for patience and surrender, which is mercy and guidance that Allah has granted as the reward for patience and turning to Him (by saying Inna Lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji`un (Verily to Allah we belong and unto Him is our return)), is worse than the calamity itself.\nIt should be noted that panicking makes one’s enemy rejoice and makes one’s friend feel sad; it makes Allah angry and makes the devils happy; it destroys reward and weakens resolve. If he is patient, seeks reward, strives to please Allah, to make his friend happy and to make his enemy sad, and seeks to relieve his brothers of their burdens and to console them before they console him, this is steadfastness and a sign of perfection – not slapping one’s cheeks, rending one’s garment, wishing for death and being discontent with the divine decree.\nIt should be noted that what comes after being patient and seeking reward is pleasure and joy that is many times greater than what he could have got from keeping what he lost. Sufficient for him is the “house of praise” that will be built for him in Paradise as a reward for his praising his Lord and turning to Him (by saying Inna Lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji`un (Verily to Allah we belong and unto Him is our return)). So let him decide which of the two calamities is greater: a calamity in this world, or the calamity of missing out on the house of praise in eternal Paradise.\xa0 In At-Tirmidhi it is narrated in a report that is attributed to the Prophet\xa0 (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “On the Day of Resurrection people will wish that their skins had been cut with scissors in this world, when they see the reward of those who were struck with calamity.” One of the salaf said: Were it not for the calamities of this world, we would come empty-handed on the Day of Resurrection.\nIt should be noted that the One Who is testing him is the Most Wise and the Most Merciful, and that He – may He be glorified – did not send this calamity in order to destroy him or cause him pain or finish him off, rather He is checking on him, testing his patience, acceptance and faith; it is so that He may hear his Du`a’ and supplication, so that He may see him standing before Him, seeking protection, filled with humility and complaining to Him.\nIt should be noted that were it not for the trials and tribulations of this world, a person could develop arrogance, self-admiration, a pharaonic attitude and hardheartedness which would lead to his doom in this world and in the Hereafter. It is a sign of the mercy of the Most Merciful that He checks on him from time to time with the remedy of calamity so as to protect him from these diseases, to keep his submission and servitude sound, and to eliminate all bad elements that may lead to his doom. Glory be to the One Who shows mercy by means of testing, and tests by means of blessing, as it is said:\n\nAllah may bless us with calamities even if that is hard, and Allah may test some people with blessings.\n\nIt should be noted that the bitterness of this world is the essence of sweetness in the Hereafter, as Allah will turn the former into the latter. Similarly the sweetness of this world is the essence of bitterness in the Hereafter. It is better to move from temporary bitterness to eternal sweetness than the other way round. If this is still not clear to you, then think of what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Paradise is surrounded with difficulties, and Hell is surrounded with desires.”\n\nWhat happens if you respond well to calamity?\nIn many cases, if a person responds well to calamity, they understand that it is a blessing and a gift, not a test.\nShaykh Al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyah] (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “A calamity that makes you turn to Allah is better for you than a blessing which makes you forget the remembrance of Allah.”\nSufyan (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “What a person dislikes may be better for him than what he likes, because what he dislikes causes him to call upon Allah, whereas what he likes may make him heedless.”\nIbn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) regarded his imprisonment as a blessing that had been caused by his enemies.\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “One day he – meaning Ibn Taymiyah – said to me: What can my enemies do to me? My garden is in my heart; wherever I go it is with me and never leaves me. My detainment is seclusion (an opportunity for worship), my being killed is martyrdom, and being expelled from my city is a journey.\nHe used to say of his detainment in the citadel: If I were to spend the fill of this citadel in gold, that would not be sufficient to express my gratitude for this blessing. Or he said: That would not be sufficient to reward them for what they have brought to me of goodness.\nWhen he was imprisoned, he used to say when prostrating: “O Allah, help me to remember You, give thanks to You and to worship You well. Ma sha Allah. He said to me (Ibn Al-Qayyim) one day: The one who is really detained is the one who keeps his heart away from his Lord, and the real prisoner is the one who is captive to his whims and desires. When he entered the citadel and was within its walls, he looked at it and said: {So a wall will be put up between them, with a gate therein. Inside it will be mercy, and outside it will be torment} [Al-Hadid 57:13]. Allah knows that I have never seen anyone who was more content with his life than him, despite all the hardship that he experienced, and the lack of luxury and comfort, in fact the opposite of that, and despite the imprisonment, threats and exhaustion that he faced; despite all of that, he was the happiest of people with his life, the most content, the most courageous, the most satisfied. You could see the signs of joy and happiness in his face. When we felt afraid and were expecting calamity, and we had nowhere to turn, we would go to him and as soon as we saw him and heard his voice, all those fears disappeared and were replaced with contentment, courage, certainty and tranquillity. Glory be to the One who showed some of His slaves His Paradise before they met Him, and opened its gates to them when they were still in this world of deeds and actions, so some of its breezes and fragrance came to them, which made them devote their energy to seeking it and competing in attaining it.” (End quote from Al-Wabil As-Sayyib, p. 110)\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/71236/what-to-say-when-calamity-strikes-you
147025,"There is an old woman who is blind and can only move with great difficulty, and the toilet is outside the house, relatively far away. Because it is difficult for her to go there during the night, her daughter-in-law puts diapers on her at night that she does not take off until the morning, because she is not able to put them on and take them off by herself. She is asking about the prayers that become due when she is wearing the diaper, and she may have urinated or defecated, so there is impurity (najasah) in them. Is her prayer valid when she is wearing the diaper?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIn order for prayer to be valid, it is stipulated that the clothes and body, and the place in which one is praying, must be pure (tahir), and it is not permissible for the worshipper to pray when he is wearing a garment that is contaminated with impurity.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {And your clothing purify} [al-Muddaththir 74:4].\nAbu Dawud (650) narrated that Abu Sa`id al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Whilst the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was leading his companions in prayer, he took off his sandals and placed them on his left. When the people saw that, they took off their sandals too. When the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) finished his prayer, he said: “What made you take off your sandals?” They said: We saw you take off your sandals, so we took off our sandals too. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Jibril (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came to me and told me that there was some dirt (impurity) on them.” And he said: “When one of you comes to the mosque, let him check and if he sees any dirt or filth (impurity) on his sandals, let him wipe them and pray in them.” Al-Albani classed it as authentic in Sahih Abi Daud.\nIt says in Zad al-Mustaqni`: Whoever carries impurity on him that cannot be overlooked, or finds it on his garment or his body, his prayer is not valid.\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his commentary: “Whoever carries impurity on him that cannot be overlooked”: from the words “that cannot be overlooked” we may understand that some impurities may be overlooked, and that is indeed so. The author stated previously that a small amount of blood may be overlooked, if it comes from a pure (tahir) living being, such as a human for example, or the blood of a sheep, camel and the like. He also stated previously that Shaykh al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyah – may Allah have mercy on him] thought that a small amount of all impurities may be overlooked, especially if it is difficult to avoid them, as in the case of those who own donkeys and rides them a great deal, for whom it is not possible to avoid drops of the donkey’s urine sometimes, if not most of the time. Thus Shaykh al-Islam thought that the reason (for overlooking it) is the difficulty in avoiding it, so whenever it is too difficult avoid the impurity, a small amount of it may be overlooked. The same may be said in the case of painters, that a small amount of paint may be overlooked if it gets onto their bodies and prevents water from reaching their skin [when doing wudu’], because religion is easy, and such things often happen to a person without him realising sometimes, or he realises but it is difficult for him to avoid it.\nSo with regard to carrying impurity, if it contaminates a person’s garment, then in fact he is carrying it, because he is wearing a garment that is impure (najis). If he puts the impurity in a bottle in his pocket, then he is carrying impurity that cannot be overlooked. This sometimes happens nowadays, when if a person wants to test his stools or urine, he puts it in a bottle and may be carrying it [in his pocket] when he is praying. This prayer is not valid, because he is carrying impurity that cannot be overlooked. End quote from ash-Sharh al-Mumti` (2/22).\nSo if someone prays wearing a diaper in which there is some impurity, and he knows that the impurity is there and remembers it, his prayer is not valid, unless he is incontinent. Regarding matters related to incontinence, please see the answers to questions no. 106751 and 126293.\nSecondly:\nThe individual must purify himself from impurities, as mentioned above. If he cannot do that, and he can afford it, he must hire someone to cleanse himself, because what is essential to doing an obligatory action is also obligatory. If he cannot afford to hire someone, because he is not well off or there is no one who can do that, then he must pray as he is, for Allah does not place on any soul a burden greater than it can bear.\nIt says in Kashshaf al-Qina` (1/102): If an amputee or someone in a similar situation, such as one who is paralyzed or sick and unable to do wudu’ by himself, can find someone to help him do wudu’ or ghusl in return for payment at the normal rate, and he is able to afford that without causing hardship to himself or to those on whose maintenance he is obliged to spend, then he must do that, because he comes under the same heading as one who is healthy. If he can find someone to help him do tayammum but is not able to find someone to help him do wudu’ or ghusl, then he must do that, as in the case of a healthy person who is able to do tayammum but not wudu’. If he cannot find anyone to help him do either wudu’ or tayammum, and he cannot afford to hire someone or cannot find someone to hire, then he must pray as he is. It says in al-Mughni: I do not know of any difference of opinion regarding that. Similarly, if he cannot find anyone except by paying more than the usual fee, unless the increase [for helping him to do wudu’ or ghusl] rather than tayammum is small, then he should pray as he is, and he does not have to repeat his prayer, as in the case of one who has neither of the means of purifying himself [that is, water for wudu’ or dust for tayammum]. What is mentioned above regarding wudu’ also applies in the case of cleaning oneself after relieving oneself (istinja’). If someone volunteers to help him purify himself, then he must accept that. It says in al-Furu`: Rather he does not have to do that [accept such help], and he may do tayammum instead. (End quote)\nThirdly:\nThe woman asked about here must do one of two things:\nFirstly: doing without the diapers, by placing a vessel or the like near her in which she can relieve herself and clean herself with water or even with tissues and the like;\nSecondly: taking off the diaper and cleansing herself from impurity before praying.\nIf neither option is possible, even by hiring someone to empty the vessel or change the diaper, and no one volunteers to do that, she may pray with the impurity, and she is excused.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/147025/is-her-prayer-valid-when-she-is-wearing-a-diaper-in-which-there-is-impurity-najasah
