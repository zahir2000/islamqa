423108,"I gave some money to a trader to use it in doing business, and he will give me a small amount every month. I am not saving any of it, as I have commitments and many expenses each month, and I have no money left at the end of the month. Is zakah due on the capital that I gave to the trader to do business with it?","['Praise be to Allah.Zakah is due on cash money, such as Egyptian pounds, if it reaches the minimum threshold (nisab) by itself, which is equivalent to 595 grams of silver.\nIf the money is invested in business, the zakah must be given every time a (Hijri) year passes since taking possession of the capital; that does not change when the money is invested in the business.\nIt says in Zad al-Mustaqni‘ (p. 87): If he buys trade goods with currency [that is, gold or silver] that reaches the minimum threshold, then the year for the trade goods (for zakah purposes) begins from the time when he acquired that currency. End quote.\nSo if someone acquired 10,000 pounds, for example, on the first day of Ramadan, then he used it in Muharram to buy goods to sell, the year for zakah on the trade goods begins on the first of Ramadan, so he should work out the value of the goods on the first day of the following Ramadan, based on the market price, and he should note what his share of the trade goods and of the available cash is, then give zakah on it.\nTherefore the equation for working out zakah is as follows:\nThe market value of the goods + the amount of available cash + any debts owed to you that you expect to collect. Then you should give 2.5% (one quarter of one tenth) of the total as zakah.\nThe scholars of the Permanent Committee were asked (9/356): I have fifteen thousand riyals, which I gave to a man to do business with it in return for half of the profit. Is zakah due on this money? On what should I give the zakah – the capital, the profit, or both? If zakah is due on the capital, and I used the capital to buy specific items, such as carpets, furniture and the like, what is the ruling in this case?\nThey replied: Zakah is due on the money mentioned, which was allocated for the purpose of trade, when one (Hijri) year has passed since acquiring it. Zakah must be given on both the capital and the profits at the end of the zakah year. If trade goods were bought with the money, then their value should be worked out at the end of the zakah year, based on the market price at that time, then zakah must be given at the rate of two and a half percent (2.5%) of the total amount of the wealth and the profit. End quote.\nShaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn ‘Abdillah ibn Baz, Shaykh ‘Abd ar-Razzaq ‘Afifi, Shaykh ‘Abdullah ibn Ghadyan.\nShaykh Salih al-Fawzan (may Allah preserve him) was asked: I have some money, seven thousand Egyptian pounds, which I put into a commercial investment project. Is zakah due on it? What is the rate, and to whom should I give it? Should I give zakah on the capital only, or on the capital and the profit?\nHe replied: Money that is invested in business is subject to zakah, if it reaches the minimum threshold (nisab) or more. It must be given on the profit as well, because the profit is connected to the capital, so zakah must be given on both. So you have to give zakah on this wealth when one (Hijri) year has passed. The profit should be added to it, then zakah must be given on the total at a rate of one quarter of one tenth… End quote from al-Muntaqa min Fatawa ash-Shaykh al-Fawzan.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/423108/he-invested-his-money-in-business-with-someone-does-he-have-to-give-zakah-on-both-the-capital-and-the-profit-and-how-should-he-give-it
21434,"What is the reward parents receive for being patient and thanking Allah, when they have an infant or child die?","['Praise be to Allah.Virtue of patience in Islam\nThere are many texts in the Quran and Sunnah which point to the virtue and great reward of those who are patient and state that Allah will give them reward without measure. This includes everyone who bears with patience any calamity with which he is tested.\xa0\nReward for losing a child in Islam\nUndoubtedly the loss of a child is one of the greatest calamities for the one whom it befalls. Whoever bears that with patience and accepts the will and decree of Allah will have a great reward by the grace and bounty of Allah. There follow some of these texts, which we hope will be of consolation to you in your time of calamity :\xa0\nAllah says (interpretation of the meanings):\xa0\n\n{And We will surely test you with something of fear and hunger and a loss of wealth and lives and fruits, but give good tidings to the patient * Who, when disaster strikes them, say, ""Indeed we belong to Allāh, and indeed to Him we will return. * Those are the ones upon whom are blessings from their Lord and mercy. And it is those who are the [rightly] guided.} [Al-Baqarah 2:155-157]\n{ … And Allah loves the steadfast.} [Al `Imran 3:146]\xa0\n{ Indeed, the patient will be given their reward without account [i.e., limit].} [Az-Zumar 39:10]\n\nAnd there are many similar verses.\xa0\nThere are also many Hadiths, including the following:\xa0\nMuslim (5318) narrated that Suhayb said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “How wonderful is the affair of the believer, for his affair is all good, and this applies to no one except the believer. If something good happens to him, he gives thanks and that is good for him, and if something bad happens to him, he bears it with patience, and that is good for him.” This has to do with the virtues of patience in general.\xa0\nHadiths on losing a child\nThere are also Hadiths which speak specifically of losing a child . For example:\xa0\n\nAt-Tirmidhi (942) narrated that Abu Sinan said: I buried my son Sinan and Abu Talhah Al-Khulani was sitting at the graveside. When I wanted to go out he took my hand and said, “Shall I not give you some glad tidings, O Abu Sinan?” I said, “Yes.” He said, “Ad-Dahhak ibn `Abd Ar-Rahman ibn `Arzab narrated to me from Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When a person’s child dies, Allah says to His angels, ‘You have taken the child of My slave.’ They say, ‘Yes.’ He says, ‘You have taken the apple of his eye.’ They say, ‘Yes.’ He says, ‘What did My slave say?’ They say, ‘He praised you and said “Inna lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji`un (Verily to Allah we belong and unto Him is our return).’ Allah says, ‘Build for My slave a house in Paradise and call it the house of praise.’”\xa0(Classed as sound by Al-Albani in As-Silsilah As-Sahihah, 1408)\xa0\nThere is a special reward for the person whose child dies but he bears that with patience and hopes for reward. It was narrated from Abu Sa`id (may Allah be pleased with him) that the women said to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Give us a day (to teach us),” So he preached to them and said, “Any woman who loses three of her children, they will be a shield for her against the Fire.” A woman said, “And two?” He said, “And two.”\xa0(Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 99 and Muslim, 4786)\xa0\nAccording to a report narrated by Al-Bukhari (1292), Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no Muslim who loses three of his children before they reach the age of puberty, but Allah will admit him to Paradise by virtue of His Mercy towards them.”\xa0\nThese Hadiths explain that if two or more of a person’s children die and he bears that with patience, then he is promised Paradise and salvation from the Fire.\xa0\nOur Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught us a Du`a to say at times of calamity, in which there is virtue and great reward. Muslim (1525) narrated that Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say, “There is no Muslim who is afflicted with a calamity and says that which Allah has enjoined, Inna lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji’oon. Allahumma ajirni fi musibati wakhluf li khayran minha (Verily to Allah we belong and unto Him is our return. O Allah, reward me for my calamity and compensate me with something better than it), but Allah will compensate him with something better than it.” She said, When Abu Salamah died, I said, who among the Muslims is better than Abu Salamah, the first household to migrate to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)? Then I said these words, and Allah compensated me with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).\xa0\n\nWe ask Allah to bless you with patience in the face of your loss, and to compensate you with something better.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21434/reward-in-islam-for-one-who-loses-a-child
284278,"Is it true that Imam ash-Shafa‘i (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “If this surah was the only surah to be revealed, it would have been sufficient for the people”? In which book did he say this?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThese words were narrated from Imam ash-Shafa‘i (may Allah be pleased with him) by more than one of the scholars. See: Tafsir al-Imam ash-Shafa‘i (3/1461), Majmu‘ al-Fatawa (28/152), Tafsir Ibn Kathir (1/203) and at-Tahrir wa’t-Tanwir (30/528).\nThere are a number of versions of this comment, but they all boil down to the same meaning. These versions include the following:\n1.. “If Allah had not sent down any proof after which people can have no excuse except this surah, that would have been sufficient for them.”\n2.. “If the people reflected on this surah, that would have been sufficient for them.”\nSecondly:\nThis surah begins with Allah swearing by al-‘asr – which is the time in which man lives, which contains wonders and signs that point to the might and wisdom of Allah – that mankind is in a state of loss (and decline) except those who attain four characteristics, namely: faith, righteous deeds, advising one another to hold fast to the truth and advising one another to be patient.\nSee: at-Tafsir al-Munir (30/390), and Asma’ Suwar al-Qur’an wa Fada’iluha, by Munirah ad-Dawsari (p. 592).\nThirdly:\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: [In this surah,] Allah, may He be exalted, divided humanity into two categories, losers and winners. The winner is the one who does what is beneficial to himself, by believing and doing righteous deeds, and shows sincerity to people by advising them to hold fast to the truth, which includes teaching them and trying to show them the right path. And he advises them to be patient, including himself in this advice. Thus the surah refers to showing sincerity towards oneself and towards others, and striving to perfect oneself and others, and to attain a perfect level in adhering to both truth and patience, in the most concise and elegant words, beautifully put together, reflecting a gentle approach.\nThe two types of sincerity are sincerity to one’s own self and to one’s brother in advising adherence to the truth and patience in doing so.\nThe two types of perfection are perfecting one’s own self and perfecting one’s brother.\nAs for attaining a perfect level in adhering to both truth and patience, that should be based on knowledge and proper understanding, and that is to be perfected through faith, willpower, love and striving in doing righteous deeds, and that cannot be done except through patience.\nHere we have six components:\nThree that a person should strive to attain himself and enjoin others to attain them: perfecting his knowledge through faith, perfecting his actions by doing righteous deeds, and persisting in that by means of patience.\nHe should enjoin others to do these three things too, so he complies with them and tells others to comply with them. Thus they become part of his character, and he teaches them to others and calls people to them.\nThis is the ultimate winner, and whatever he misses out on of winning is commensurate with what he missed out on with regard to these qualities, and he will incur losses.

20069,What is the concept of engagement in Islam? Usually an engagement party is one in which the fiance/fiancee exchange rings. Is this the prescribed method in the shariah?,"['Praise be to Allah.What is engagement in Islam?\nEngagement in Islam means that a man asks to marry a woman and is accepted. The view of the scholars is that engagement is prescribed for one who wants to get married. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0{And there is no sin on you if you make a hint of betrothal…}\xa0[Al-Baqarah 2:235]\nIt was narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) got engaged to `Aishah. (Al-Bukhari, An-Nikah, 4793) It is also stated in Al-Bukhari and Muslim\xa0 that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) got engaged to Hafsah. (Al-Bukhari, An-Nikah, 4830)\xa0\nLooking at prospective wife I Islam\nThe Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) encouraged the one who wants to get engaged to look at the woman to whom he wishes to propose . According to the Hadith, “When any one of you proposes marriage to a woman, if he can look at that which will encourage him to go ahead and marry her, then let him do so.” (Abu Dawud, An-Nikah, 2082; classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud, 1832)\xa0\nProhibited Practices in Engagement in Islam\nBut in Islamic Shari`ah there are no specific practices that must be followed with regard to engagement. What some Muslims do, announcing the engagement, having a party to celebrate and exchanging gifts, all comes under the heading of customs which are permissible in principle, and none of them are prohibited except those which Shari`ah indicates are prohibited – which includes the exchange of rings between the engaged couple , a custom which is known in Arabic as “Diblah.” This custom goes against Shari`ah for the following reasons:\xa0\n\nSome people think that these rings increase the love between the spouses and have an effect on their relationship. This is an ignorant (Jahili) belief and is an attachment to something for which there is no basis in Shari`ah and which does not make sense. \xa0\nThis custom involves imitating the non-Muslims such as Christians and others. It is not a Muslim custom at all. The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) warned us against that when he said, “You will inevitably follow the paths of those who came before you, handspan by handspan, cubit by cubit, until even if they entered the hole of a lizard, you will follow them.” We said, “O Messenger of Allah,\xa0 (do you mean) the Jews and Christians?” He said, “Who else?” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, Al-I`tisam bil Kitab was-Sunnah, 6889 and Muslim, Al-`Ilm, 6723)\xa0\n\nAnd the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever imitates a people is one of them.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, Al-Libas, 4031; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud, 3401)\n\nThis engagement usually takes place before the marriage contract , in which case it is not permissible for the man to put the ring on his fiancée’s hand himself, because she is still a stranger (non-Mahram) to him, and has not yet become his wife.\xa0\n\nFinally, we will quote the words of Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) on this matter:\xa0\n“‘Diblah’ is a word that refers to the engagement ring. In principle there is nothing wrong with rings (i.e., they are permissible), unless they are accompanied by certain beliefs, as some people do when the man writes his name on the ring that he gives to his fiancée, and the woman writes her name on the ring that she gives to her fiancé, believing that this will guarantee the bonds between the spouses. In this case this ‘Diblah’ or engagement ring is haram, because it represents an attachment to something for which there is no basis in Shari`ah and which does not make sense. Similarly it is not permissible for the man to put the ring on the woman’s hand himself, because she is not yet his wife, so she is still a stranger (i.e., non-mahram) to him; she is not his wife until after the marriage contract is done.” (Al-Fatawa Al-Jami`ah lil Mar’ah Al-Muslimah, 3/914).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20069/engagement-in-islam
8991,"The custom in our country is to put a stone, concrete or a peg at the head and foot of the grave, or sometimes just at the head. What is the Islamic ruling on that?","['Praise be to Allah.Prohibition on building structures over graves\nIslam forbids building structures over graves , and commands that any such structures should be knocked down. But it is permitted to put a marker on the grave so that the family and friends of the deceased will know where it is. However, this marker should not be a structure or anything else that is not allowed in the Shari`ah.\xa0\nEvidence for the prohibition on building structures over graves\nWith regard to the prohibition on building structures over graves , the evidence for that is as follows.\xa0\nIt was narrated that Jabir said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade plastering over graves, sitting on them and building structures over them.\xa0(Narrated by Muslim, 970)\nAsh-Shawkani (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0“The phrase “building structures over them: indicates that it is haram to build anything over a grave .\xa0\nAsh-Shafi`i (may Allah have mercy on him) and his companions made the following distinction: if the structure is built on the property of the person who builds it, it is disliked, and if it is in a public graveyard, it is prohibited.\xa0However, there is no evidence for making this distinction.\xa0\nAsh-Shafi`i said: I saw the Imams in Makkah ordering that what had been built (over graves ) was to be knocked down.\xa0\nThe Hadith of `Ali also indicates that such structures should be destroyed.” (Nayl Al-Awtar, 4/132; the view of Ash-Shafi`i is mentioned in Al-Umm, 1/277)\xa0\nThe Hadith of `Ali referred to will be quoted below.\nEvidence for the command to knock down structures built over graves\nWith regard to the command to knock down structures that have been built over graves , that is proven in the Sunnah.\xa0\n\nIt was narrated that Abul-Hayaj As-Asadi said: `Ali ibn Abu Talib said to me: “Shall I not send you on the same mission as the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sent me? Do not leave any statue without erasing it, and do not leave any raised grave without leveling it.”\xa0 (Narrated by Muslim, 969).\xa0\n\nAsh-Shawkani (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\nThe words “do not leave any raised grave without leveling it” means that the Sunnah is that a grave should not be made very high, and there should be no differentiation between those who were virtuous and those who were not virtuous.\xa0\nIt seems that making a grave higher than the amount that is permitted is prohibited. This was clearly stated by the companions of Ahmad and a group of the companions of Ash-Shafi`i and Malik.\xa0\nThe view that it is not prohibited because the earlier and later generations did that without anyone denouncing that action, as Imam Yahya and Al-Mahdi said in Al-Ghayth, is not correct, because the most that can be said is that they kept quiet about it, and keeping quiet does not count as evidence if it has to do with matters which are not definitive, and the prohibition of making graves high is not definitive.\xa0\nMaking graves high that is mentioned in the Hadith especially includes the domes and shrines that are built over graves, and the taking of graves as places of worship. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed those who do that. (Nayl Al-Awtar, 4/130)\xa0\nAre gravestones prohibited in Islam?\nWith regard to it being permissible to mark a grave with something permissible, there is evidence in the Sunnah which explains that.\xa0\nIt was narrated from Kathir ibn Zayd Al-Madani that Al-Muttalib said: When `Uthman ibn Madh`un died, his bier was brought out and he was buried, then the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) ordered a man to bring a rock but he was not able to carry it. So the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stood up and rolled up his sleeves. Kathir said: Al-Muttalib said: the one who narrated that to me from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: it is as if I can see the whiteness of the arms of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when he rolled up his sleeves. Then he carried it and placed it at the head (of the grave), and said, “From this I will recognize the grave of my brother, and I can bury those among my family who die near him.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 3206)\xa0\nThe chain of narrators\xa0 of this Hadith was classed as sound by Al-Hafidh ibn Hajar in At-Talkhis Al-Habir, 2/133)\xa0\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\nThere is nothing wrong with marking a grave with a stone or a piece of wood. There is nothing wrong with a man marking a grave so that he will know where it is. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) marked the grave of `Uthman ibn Madh`un.
