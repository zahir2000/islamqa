114847,"I had a share portfolio and someone bought it from me to be paid later, on condition that he give me its value with added value one and a half years after buying it from me. How should I give zakah on it? Should I give zakah on its original price when it was bought, or the value that the buyer will give me in one and a half years’ time? Please note that he has already sold the contents of the portfolio and is buying and selling shares.","['Praise be to Allah.If you sold the share portfolio to be paid for later on, this price is a debt that is owed by the buyer, and comes under the rulings of zakah on debts.\nIt is well known that if someone is owed a debt by someone else, then zakah on it is subject to the following considerations:\nIf the debt is owed by one who is well-off and willing to pay, and he acknowledges the debt and has the ability to pay it, then zakah must be paid on the debt when one year has passed, as if the money was in your possession.\nBut if the debt is owed by someone who is delaying payment or denying the debt, you do not have to pay zakah on it until you receive it and one full year has passed since you received it.\nPlease see the answer to question no. 106434 .\nThus you will realise that zakah is to be paid on the price that you will receive, and not the original value of the portfolio, because this price has become a debt that is owed to you, so you should give zakah on the debt as noted above, whether the buyer has sold the contents of the portfolio or not.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/114847/he-sold-a-share-portfolio-to-be-paid-for-in-a-year-and-a-halfs-time-does-he-have-to-give-zakah-on-it
305491,"Nowadays, Many Android/ios Apps such as E-Wallets offer cashbacks for using their App, Customers can use these apps as per their need,for instance,","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThere is nothing wrong with using the e-wallet for transferring money or buying things, but it is essential to ascertain that the exchange will take place immediately – meaning that the money will reach the seller’s account at the time of purchase – if the customer is going to buy gold, silver or currencies, because it is stipulated that the exchange must take place immediately when buying these things.\nSecondly:\nWhat may be understood from the question is that the purchaser will get cashback from the apps that provide the e-wallet.\nIf what is meant is that the app obtains discounts from sellers for the users of the app, there is nothing wrong with that.\nBut if the app gives the users cash or gifts, in order to encourage them to use the app and deposit money in it, or they announce that whoever loads credit of 200 rupees, for example, will get 50 rupees cashback, this is an unlawful type of gift.\nThat is because putting money in the e-wallet is regarded as a loan to the organisation that provides the app, and it is not permissible to accept gifts in return for a loan, because of the report narrated by Ibn Majah from Yahya ibn Abi Ishaq, who said: I asked Anas ibn Malik about a man among us who gives his brother a loan, then (the borrower) gives him a gift. He said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If any one of you borrows something then he gives (the lender) a gift or gives him a ride on his mount, he should not accept the gift or the ride, unless they used to treat each other in that manner beforehand.” Classed as hasan by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah in al-Fatawa al-Kubra (6/159).\nAl-Bukhari narrated in his Sahih (3814) that Abu Burdah said: I came to Madinah, where I met ‘Abdullah ibn Salam. He said to me: You are living in a land in which riba is prevalent, so if someone owes you something and he gives you a gift of a load of straw, or a load of barley, or a load of foodstuff, do not accept it, for it is riba.\nIt says in al-Ma‘ayir ash-Shar‘iyyah, p. 325: It is not permissible for the borrower to give a specific gift to the lender or to benefit him in any way during the loan period, if that is because of the loan, meaning that that was not something habitual between them before the loan. End quote.\nIt says in Qararat al-Hay’ah ash-Shar‘iyyah li Masraf ar-Rajihi (1/542), statement no. 355 regarding the distribution of specific gifts, such as bishts and watches to customers with current accounts, credit cards or insurance:\nIt is not permissible to give specific gifts, especially to holders of current accounts or some of them, because that comes under the heading of prohibited forms of loans that bring benefits. End quote.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/305491/ruling-on-discounts-and-cashback-offered-by-e-wallet-apps
