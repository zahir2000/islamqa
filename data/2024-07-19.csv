511535,How can we reconcile between affirming Allah’s exaltedness and the verse {and the heavens will be rolled up in His Right Hand}?,"['Praise be to Allah.There is no contradiction between affirming the exaltedness of Allah, may He be exalted, and the fact that on the Day of Resurrection He will roll up the heavens in His right hand, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{They have not given due recognition to Allah. On the Day of Resurrection, the entire earth will be in His grip, and the heavens will be rolled up in His Right Hand. Glorified and exalted be Allah far above the partners they ascribe to Him!}\xa0[az-Zumar 39:67].\nThat is because exaltedness means that Allah, may He be exalted, is above all things, above the heavens, above the Throne and above everything that is created. He is exalted in the sense of controlling and subduing, and exalted in His Essence (in a true sense). Thus He is the Exalted, the Most High, as is stated in His Book and by His Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and as was unanimously agreed upon by the early generations of the ummah.\nWhat is narrated in the texts about Allah being “in heaven” – such as the verse (interpretation of the meaning): {Do you feel secure that He who is in heaven would not cause the earth to swallow you and suddenly it would begin to shake?} [al-Mulk 67:16];\nThe hadith narrated from Abu Sa‘eed al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Do you not trust me, when I am the trustee of the One Who is in heaven”;\nThe hadith narrated by Muslim (537) from Mu‘awiyah ibn al-Hakam as-Sulami about his striking his slave woman. He said: I came to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and he regarded that as a grievous action on my part. I said: O Messenger of Allah, should I set her free? He said: “Bring her to me.” So I brought her to him and he said to her: “Where is Allah?” She said: In heaven. He said: “Who am I?” She said: You are the Messenger of Allah. He said: “Set her free, for she is a believer.”\nWhat is meant by fi’s-sama’ (translated here as “in heaven”) is exaltedness, because anything that is high above may be called sama’ in Arabic.\nOr it may mean above the heaven, because prepositions in Arabic may be used interchangeably, as in the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): {and I will crucify you on [fi – lit. “in”] the trunks of palm trees} [Ta-Ha 20:71] and {So travel freely, [O disbelievers], throughout [fi – lit. “in”] \xa0the land} [at-Tawbah 9:2], meaning on the land.\nNone of Ahl as-Sunnah suggest that Allah is inside the seven heavens, or that anything of His creation encompasses Him; exalted be Allah far above that.\nAbu’l-Hasan al-Ash‘ari says in his letter to the people on the border (Risalah ila Ahl ath-Thaghr, p. 130), regarding what was agreed upon by Ahl as-Sunnah: That Allah, may He be exalted, is above His heavens, above His throne. This is indicated by the verses (interpretation of the meaning): {Do you feel secure that He who is in heaven would not cause the earth to swallow you and suddenly it would begin to shake?} [al-Mulk 67:16] and {To Him ascend all good words, and righteous deeds exalt them} [Fatir 35:10].\nAnd Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): {The Most Gracious rose over the Throne [in a manner that befits His Majesty]} [Ta-Ha 20:5]. His rising over the Throne does not mean that He has control of it, as the Qadaris said, because He, may He be glorified and exalted, has always been above all things. End quote.\nAl-Bayhaqi said in al-I‘tiqad (p. 112): Chapter regarding Allah’s rising above the Throne. Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {The Most Gracious rose over the Throne [in a manner that befits His Majesty]} [Ta-Ha 20:5].\nThe Throne is the well-known seat that is known to people of reason. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says elsewhere (interpretation of the meaning): {and His Throne had been upon water} [Hud 11:7]… and {They fear their Lord above them, and they do what they are commanded} [an-Nahl 16:50], and {To Him ascend all good words, and righteous deeds exalt them} [Fatir 35:10] and {Do you feel secure that He who is in heaven would not cause the earth to swallow you and suddenly it would begin to shake?} [al-Mulk 67:16].\nWhat is meant is the One Who is above the heavens, as Allah says elsewhere: {and I will crucify you on [fi – lit. “in”] the trunks of palm trees} [Ta-Ha 20:71] and {So travel freely, [O disbelievers], throughout [fi – lit. “in”]\xa0 \xa0the land} [at-Tawbah 9:2], meaning on the land.\nEverything that is up above may be called sama’ in Arabic, and the Throne is above the highest heavens.\nWhat the verse means – and Allah knows best – is: Do you feel secure that He Who is on the Throne [will not cause the earth to swallow you up…], as is clearly stated in other verses. End quote.\nAl-Hafiz ibn ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said: As for the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {Do you feel secure that He who is in heaven would not cause the earth to swallow you and suddenly it would begin to shake?} [al-Mulk 67:16], what it means is: the One Who is above the heavens, meaning above the Throne.\nThe Arabic preposition fi (“in”) may mean ‘ala (“above”) as in the verses: and {So travel freely, [O disbelievers], throughout [fi – lit. “in”]\xa0 the land} [at-Tawbah 9:2], meaning on the land, and {and I will crucify you on [fi – lit. “in”] the trunks of palm trees} [Ta-Ha 20:71].""(At-Tamhid\xa0 7/130).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The scholars said: In response, we may adopt one of two interpretations:\n1. Either we may understand as-sama’ as referring to what is up above, and as-sama’ in the sense of what is up above is well known in Arabic, and indeed, in the Qur’an. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {He sends down water from the heaven [as-sama’] and the watercourses flow} [ar-Ra‘d 13:17]; what is meant by as-sama’ [translated here as heaven] is what is up above, because the water comes down from the clouds, not from as-sama’, which is the canopy of heaven, whereas the cloud is up high, between heaven and earth, as Allah, may He be exalted, says elsewhere (interpretation of the meaning): {and the clouds controlled between the heaven and the earth} [al-Baqarah 2:164].\nSo what is meant by the One Who is in heaven is the One Who is up above.\nThere is no problem after that, for Allah is up above; there is nothing at the same level as Him and nothing above Him.\n2.. Or we may understand the preposition fi (“in”) as meaning ‘ala (“above”), and regard as-sama’ as being the canopy of heaven raised high, referring to the heavenly bodies, as the preposition fi (“in”) may mean ‘ala (“above”) in Arabic. In fact, in the Qur’an, Pharaoh says to his people, the magicians who believed: {and I will crucify you on [fi – lit. “in”] the trunks of palm trees} [Ta-Ha 20:71].\nThus the meaning of the One Who is in the heaven is the One Who is above the heaven.""(Sharh al-Wasitiyyah\xa0 1/398).\nOnce this is clear, it is the same whether the heavens are there or Allah, may He be glorified, has rolled up the heavens in His Right Hand, for He is above all things, and He has no need of the heavens or the Throne.\nAt-Tahawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his ‘Aqidah (p. 54): The Throne and the Footstool are real, and Allah has no need of the Throne nor anything beneath it; He encompasses and is above all things. End quote.\nConclusion:\nThe confusion about the apparent contradiction is only caused by thinking that Allah, may He be exalted, is in the heavens or that He needs the heavens to be exalted.\nHe, may He be glorified, is far above both, for nothing encompasses Him and He has no need of anything, may He be blessed, exalted and sanctified.\nYou should understand that there is no alternative to believing that He is exalted, except two views which are both false: the view that Allah is present everywhere, as the Jahamis said, and the view that Allah is neither inside the universe not outside it, as the Ash‘aris said.\nAdh-Dhahabi (may Allah have mercy on him) concluded his book al-‘Uluw li’l-‘Ali al-Ghaffar by saying:\nAllah is above His Throne, as the early generations were agreed on and the leading scholars narrated it from them. They said that in refutation of the Jahamis, who said that Allah is everywhere, and quoted as evidence the verse (interpretation of the meaning): {and He is with you} [al-Hadid 57:4].\nThese two views are those that existed at the time of the Tabi‘in and succeeding generations and they are reasonable views in general.\nAs for the third view which developed recently – which says that Allah, may He be exalted, is nowhere; He is not outside anything or above His Throne; He is not connected to His creation or separate from them; His holy Essence is not separate from His creation; He is not in any direction and is not outside the directions; and He is not this and not that, and so on – this is something that makes no sense and is incomprehensible, in addition to being contrary to the religious texts.\nSo flee for the sake of your faith and beware of the views of ahl al-kalam. Believe in Allah and what came from Allah, as Allah intended it, and delegate your affairs to Allah, for there is no power and no strength except with Allah.""(Al-‘Uluw, p. 267).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/511535/how-can-we-reconcile-between-affirming-allahs-exaltedness-and-the-verse-and-the-heavens-will-be-rolled-up-in-his-right-hand
21616,"If I miss a prayer for a reason such as sleeping, should I pray the prayer I have missed or the present prayer, if the present prayer has already been prayed in congregation?","['Praise be to Allah.Importance of offering prayer on time\nThe Muslim should maintain the habit of praying regularly on time , for Allah praises the believers who, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And those who guard their Salah (prayers) well.” [Al-Ma’arij 70:34]\nMaking missed up prayer\xa0\nIf a person has an excuse and he missed a prayer, then he has to make it up , because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever forgets a prayer or sleeps and misses it , the expiation for this sin is to pray it when he remembers it.” (Narrated by Muslim, Al-Masajid wa Mawadi` Al-Salah, 1103)\nShould one pray the missed prayer first?\nIf you miss a prayer , then you have to pray that prayer first, then pray the current prayer; it is not permissible to delay (making up the missed prayer). It is commonly thought among the people that if a man misses an obligatory prayer, he should make it up with the corresponding obligatory prayer of the next day, so that if, for example, he missed Fajr on one day he can only pray it with Fajr on the second day. This is wrong, and it goes against the teaching of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), in both his words and deeds.\nIt was narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever forgets a prayer or sleeps and misses it, then let him pray it when he remembers it.” He did not say, let him pray it on the following day when the time for that prayer comes, rather he said, “let him pray it when he remembers it.”\xa0\nWith regard to the Prophet’s actions, when he missed a prayer on one of the days of the campaign of Al-Khandaq, he prayed it before the current prayer , which indicates that one has to pray the missed prayer and then pray the current prayer. But if he forgets and prays the current prayer before the missed prayer, or he was ignorant and did not know (of the ruling), then he prayer is valid because he has an excuse. (See Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin, vol. 12, p. 222)\nThe hadith about the prayer on the day of Al-Khandaq was narrated by An-Nasa’i from ‘Abd Ar-Rahman ibn Abu Sa`id from his father, who said: “The disbelievers kept us busy on the day of Al-Khandaq and distracted us from praying Dhuhr until the sun set. Then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded Bilal to call the Iqamah for Dhuhr prayer, and he prayed it, then he called the Iqamah for Asr and he prayed it, then he called the Adhan for Maghrib then he prayed it as he usually prayed it, on time.” (Al-Adhan, 655; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih An-Nasa’i, no. 638)\nMaking up missed prayers: In what order?\nThe action of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) indicates that it is obligatory to pray the missed prayers in the right order . But if there is only enough time left to pray the current prayer, then he should pray the current prayer, then pray the ones that came before it.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21616/should-one-pray-the-missed-prayer-first
296830,What is the ruling on calling a Facebook group “An hour for the Lord and an hour for yourself”? Is there any reason to be uncomfortable about this phrase?,"['Praise be to Allah.If what is meant by the one who says this is that people need time\xa0 for relaxation and joy in some permissible ways, in order to rest and have a break from striving for worldly aims and from striving for the hereafter, so that people will not become exhausted from constant striving and will be re-energized to resume their efforts and striving for what will benefit them in this world and the hereafter – if this is what is meant by the one who says this, that is a sound meaning and there does not seem to be anything wrong with this phrase.\nIt is similar in meaning to what is mentioned in the famous sahih hadith:\nIt was narrated that Hanzalah said: We were with the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and he exhorted us and reminded us of the Fire. Then I came home and laughed with my children and played with my wife. Then I went out and met Abu Bakr, and I mentioned that to him. He said: I have done the same as you mentioned. We met the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and I said: O Messenger of Allah, Hanzalah has become a hypocrite.\nHe said: “Don’t speak like that.”\nSo I told him what we had said, and Abu Bakr said: I have done the same as he has.\nHe said: “O Hanzalah, there is a time for this and a time for that. If your hearts were always as they are when you are remembering Allah (dhikr), the angels would shake hands with you in the streets and greet you.”\xa0Narrated by Muslim (2750).\nThis hadith highlights the virtue of persisting in dhikr (remembering Allah) and doing righteous deeds, and that it is permissible to stop doing that sometimes in order to do things that bring joy, so as to avoid exhaustion.\nIbn al-Jawzi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe words “there is a time for this and a time for that” mean that there is a time for being alert and focused (on dhikr and righteous deeds) and a time for doing permissible things (by way of relaxation), even if that could lead to lack of focus on dhikr and worship. That is because if someone keeps striving without pause, he will not last. So the one who is focused on dhikr and worship has no choice but to deal with things that will distract him from that, in order to maintain a good balance. How could a person be able to eat, drink and have marital relations if he thinks about matters of the hereafter as if he is seeing them with his own eyes? In being distracted from that there is a great benefit, but if it increases, it will cause trouble. Rather it should be of appropriate proportions.""(Kashshaf al-Mushkil\xa0 4/229-230).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“O Hanzalah, there is a time for this and a time for that” means a time for the Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, and a time for one’s family and children, and a time for oneself that will give you space to breathe and relax, and give those who have rights their rights.\nThis is an example of the justice and perfection of Islam. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has rights, so He should be given his rights. A person’s own self has rights and must be given its rights. A man’s family have rights and they must be given their rights. Visitors and guests have rights and must be given their rights. In this way the individual will be able to fulfil all the duties he owes with ease, and he will be able to worship Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, with ease, because if he overburdens himself and is too strict with himself, he will grow tired and weary, and will neglect many of his duties.""(Sharh Riyad as-Salihin\xa02/236).\nThis is the correct understanding of this phrase: time spent worshipping Allah, may He be exalted, and reflecting on matters of the hereafter, and time spent in permissible things and fulfilling one’s duties towards oneself and others, so that the Muslim will be able to do all the duties that are required of him, and will be energized to do his duties by this time spent in doing permissible things.\nAl-Bukhari (1968) narrated from ‘Awn ibn Abi Juhayfah, from his father, who said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) established the bond of brotherhood between Salman and Abu’d-Darda’. Salman visited Abud-Darda’ and saw Umm’d-Darda’ looking unkempt. He said to her: What is the matter with you? She said: Your brother Abu’d-Darda’ has no need of worldly matters. Abu’d-Darda’ came and made some food for him. Salman said: Eat (with me). Abu’d-Darda’ said: I am fasting. Salman said: I will not eat until you eat – so Abu’d-Darda’ ate. When night came, Abu’d-Darda’ went to get up (to pray) and Salman said: Sleep, so he slept. Then he went to get up again and Salman said: Sleep. Then towards the end of the night, Salman said: Now get up – and they prayed.\nSalman said to him: Your Lord has a right over you, your own self has a right over you, and your wife has a right over you, so give each one who has a right their due rights.\nThen he came to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and told him about that, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Salman has spoken the truth.”\xa0\xa0\nIf this is what is meant by calling the group by this name, there does not seem to be anything wrong with it, and what is meant is that a person will spend some time with his friends, talking to them and exchanging ideas with them, and chatting about permissible things for the purpose of relaxation, so that he will then be able to focus on his worship after that with energy.\nOne of the conditions stipulated regarding that is that the time spent with this group should be short and should fulfil the purpose of warding off boredom, and no more than that. If it is done more than that, it will become harmful and will be a waste of time, and it will be detrimental to the individual and will be of no benefit to him.\nBut if the one who says that is someone who spends most of his time in idle pursuits, playing and messing about, and he regards the time spent on each as being the same and – not only that – he also does what idle people do, who spend most of their time in playing and messing around, this is detrimental to both religious and worldly interests; it is foolishness and bad judgement.\nHowever, it should be noted that some people say these words and what they mean is a time for worship and a time for doing whatever they want of playing and messing about – even if it is in prohibited matters. This is not permissible at all, for the Muslim is enjoined to avoid what Allah has prohibited at all times. All that is acceptable is having some time to have a break, in which he can ward off boredom and fatigue by doing some permissible things, not what is prohibited.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/296830/the-saying-an-hour-for-the-lord-and-an-hour-for-yourself
