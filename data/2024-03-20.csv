293605,"If one does not perform the Tarawih prayer in the mosque for one or more days, does it fall under the saying of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him): ""Whoever stands (in prayer) during Ramadan with faith and seeking reward, his previous sins will be forgiven,"" or is it necessary to stand (in prayer) all the nights of Ramadan?","['Praise be to Allah.Abu Hurairah narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: ""Whoever stands (in prayer) during Ramadan with faith and seeking reward, his previous sins will be forgiven."" Reported by Al-Bukhari (2009) and Muslim (759).\nThe apparent meaning of the Hadith is that it refers to standing (in prayer) for the entire month of Ramadan, whether it is done in congregation in the mosque or at home. Thus, the ruling includes everyone who stands (in prayer) during Ramadan, whether in congregation or alone, in the mosque or at home.\nAs-San`ani said:\n""It is possible that it means standing (in prayer) for all its nights, and that whoever stands for part of it does not achieve the forgiveness mentioned, which is the apparent meaning."" End quote from ""Subul As-Salam"" (4/182).\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n""He (the Prophet) said: \'Whoever stands (in prayer) during Ramadan\' means the month of Ramadan, and it encompasses the whole month, from its beginning to its end."" End quote from ""Sharh Bulugh Al-Maram"" (3/290).\nShaykh Ibn Jibrin (may Allah have mercy on him) stated in his ""Fatawa"" (24/9) with the numbering of Al-Shamilah:\n""Standing (in prayer) during Ramadan is achieved by praying a portion of every night, like half or a third of it, whether that is by praying eleven Rak`ahs or twenty-three, and standing (in prayer) is achieved by praying behind the Imam of the neighborhood until he departs, even if it is for less than an hour..."" End quote.\nFor those who miss standing (in prayer) during some nights of Ramadan; if it was due to an excuse that prevented them from doing so, then this virtue mentioned in the Hadith is hoped for them; due to the saying of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him): ""When a servant falls ill or travels, it will be written for him as if he was doing the deeds he used to perform when he was healthy and resident."" Reported by Al-Bukhari (2996).\nAl-Qastallani said:\n""Whoever stands (in prayer) during Ramadan"" all its nights, or some of them when he is unable to do so, and his intention was to pray if not for the obstacle."" End quote from ""Irshad As-Sari"" (3/425).\nHowever, if one leaves standing (in prayer) during some nights of Ramadan out of laziness, the apparent meaning of the Hadith is that he does not achieve the mentioned virtue.\nTherefore, it is upon a Muslim to be keen on praying Tarawih in congregation in the mosque, and if he is unable or preoccupied, he should pray at home to the best of his ability.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/293605/to-attain-the-virtue-of-the-night-prayer-must-one-pray-every-night
178430,"I am not married and my period comes regularly every month. But my problem is that it starts off yellow, tinged with beige and brown, and sometimes goes on for three or four days with pain in the lower abdomen, intense agitation and bad mood. Then it becomes black for one or two days at the most, then red blood comes for between five and seven days, then it goes back to a brown colour, then yellow, then after one or two days of the yellow discharge, sometimes there is a white discharge, the sign of purity (end of the period), or sometimes the yellow discharge continues until the next period, i.e., it lasts for a month.
My question is: when should I pray and when should I stop praying? When should I fast and when should I not fast?","['Praise be to Allah.Ruling on yellow discharges before period\nThe yellowish or brownish discharge that precedes the blood is not regarded as the menses; the same applies to that which comes after seeing the white discharge (that signals the end of the period), because Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “We used not to regard the yellowish brownish discharge after the white discharge (that signals the end of the period) as being of any significance.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 307; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Irwa’ Al-Ghalil, 199)\xa0\nRuling on yellow discharges after the bleeding and before the white discharge\nWith regard to yellowish and brownish discharge that comes after the bleeding and before the white discharge (that signals the end of the period), this is regarded as menses, because of the report narrated by Malik in Al-Muwatta’, 130, from Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her), according to which she said: The women used to send to `Aishah, the Mother of the Believers, small vessels containing the pieces of cotton on which there were yellowish traces from the menstrual blood, and they would ask her about praying, and she would say to them: Do not be hasty, wait until you see the white discharge, referring to that which signals the end of the period.\xa0\nThis was also narrated by Al-Bukhari in a mu`allaq report (Kitab Al-Hayd, Bab Iqbal Al-MahId wa Idbarihi; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Irwa’ Al-Ghalil, 198)\nBased on that, the yellowish or brownish discharge that lasts for three or four days before the bleeding starts is not regarded as menses, and you should not stop praying or fasting at that time.\xa0\nThe black blood and the red blood that comes after it, and the yellowish discharge, are menses, until you see the white discharge or complete dryness.\xa0\nIf you see the white discharge or complete dryness, then any discharge after that, yellowish or brownish, is not regarded as menses.\xa0\nRuling on the red blood that continues longer than 15 days\nIf the red blood continues, or the yellowish or brownish discharge that come after it, before the white discharge or complete dryness appear – if that goes on for longer than fifteen days, then you are experiencing Istihadah (irregular, non-menstrual bleeding), according to the majority of scholars.\nSome scholars say that Istihadah cannot be proven unless that continues for the entire month or for the entire month apart from two or three days. This is the view favoured by Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) and those who followed him and those who do not think there is any maximum length for the menses, and their view is closer to the apparent meaning of the evidence.\xa0\nIf it becomes clear that you are experiencing Istihadah , then in the following months you should act in accordance with your cycle as it was in the past. So you should stop praying and so on for the duration of bleeding, until the appearance of the white discharge (signalling the end of the period) that you mentioned in your question, then you should do Ghusl. For example, if your period, before experiencing Istihadah, used to last for ten days, then you should do Ghusl after the tenth day, and do Wudu at the time of each prayer.\xa0\nA woman who did not have a regular cycle before experiencing Istihadah should base her actions on differentiating between different kinds of bleeding. This has been explained in the answer to question no.\xa068818 \xa0\nOur advice to you is to consult a specialist doctor for treatment of these ongoing discharges.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/178430/can-you-pray-with-yellow-discharge-before-period
449483,"Is it permissible to take injections for weight loss half an hour before Iftar, knowing that they are administered either in the stomach, thigh, or arm, and they release a hormone in the body that helps to increase insulin levels; to enhance the metabolic rate, assist in eating a smaller quantity of food, and to suppress appetite?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nWeight loss injections, which are one of the therapeutic techniques that help reduce weight, rely on injecting the body with the substance liraglutide, a protein similar to carbohydrates that affects neural receptors in the brain, working to suppress appetite and reduce sugar intake.\nSaxenda injections work to lower blood sugar levels by preventing the body from secreting the hormone glucagon, which affects sensory receptors in the brain, thereby reducing appetite for food and increasing the feeling of fullness. Consequently, the rate of fat burning in the body increases, and it is converted into the energy needed by the body. End quote.\nSecondly:\nThese injections are neither food nor drink, nor do they serve as a substitute for them, meaning they are not nutritious, and therefore they have no effect on fasting.\nSince they help suppress appetite, they are not considered the same as nutritious injections.\nIt is stated in ""Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da\'imah"" (10/252):\n""It is permissible for a fasting person to be treated with injections in the muscle or vein during the daytime in Ramadan.\nHowever, it is not permissible for a fasting person to take nutritional injections during the daytime in Ramadan; because it is similar to consuming food and drink, and taking such injections is considered a trick to break the fast in Ramadan.

114624,"I read on your website the questions and answers regarding the issue of women changing their surname upon marriage. My question is, can a husband force his wife to change her surname against her will? And what can the wife do if her husband and his family are pressuring her to change her surname in the name of legal issues?","['Praise be to Allah.Is it prohibited to take your husband’s last name?\nIt is not permissible for a woman to take her husband’s name or his family name because that is attributing oneself to someone other than one’s father , and imitating the disbelievers from whom this custom was adopted.\xa0\nAl-Bukhari (3508) and Muslim (61) narrated from Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) that he heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “Any man who knowingly attributes himself to someone other than his father is guilty of disbelief. Whoever claims to belong to a people when he has nothing to do with them, let him take his place in Hell.”\xa0\n‘When he has nothing to do with them’ means, when he has no lineage among them, as is highlighted in some reports.\xa0\nCan a husband force his wife to take his family name?\nThe husband has no right to force his wife to change her surname, and if he forces her to do it, she should not obey him, because it is obedience to a created being which involves disobedience to the Creator.\nSo she should persist in her refusal and explain to him that it is prohibited, and look for Islamically acceptable means of establishing her rights from a legal point of view. \xa0\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 6241 , 4362 , and 82138 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/114624/is-it-prohibited-to-take-your-husbands-last-name
