182467,"I would like to ask you about food coupons (food stamps). Many Muslims receive food stamps in the USA, hence my question is: is it permissible to sell these stamps (coupons) and turn them into cash? Even though it is known that the government of the USA does not allow that, and the government says that the stamps are only for food. What is the ruling on the one who does that?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt is not permissible for the Muslim to cheat the system and do something illegal in order to get something that he is not entitled to, such as help in the form of cash or food, even if he is in need. Refraining from taking it is more appropriate and is better, especially if he is living in a non-Muslim country, because humiliation is more apparent there, and this is contrary to the dignity of the Muslim, as Islam encourages the Muslim to work and not be idle.\nSecondly:\nIn the case where a person needs to receive food help in any country, there is nothing wrong – in principle – with the recipient selling the coupons for cash or other goods or food other than what is written on the coupon. That is because the way in which he obtained these coupons was not by purchasing them; rather they were a gift. However, if the coupons are something that he bought, then it is not permissible for the buyer of the coupons to sell them before he obtains the food itself with the coupons [which he may then sell]. But if the coupons were a gift, then it is not stipulated that he should obtain the food [and then sell it]. Similar to that is the case of selling some share of inheritance before acquiring it. Thus it is known that it is permissible for the initial owner of the coupons to sell them for whatever he likes, whether it is cash or something else, but it is not permissible for the one who acquires them from him to sell them before he acquires food with the coupons [which he may then sell]. This is the more correct view, which is based on the fact that some of the Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) prohibited that. It is also the view of the Malikis and Shafa‘is.\nMuhammad ibn Rushd al-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It was said to Malik: What do you think, is it permissible for these people who are going to receive some food to sell it before they acquire it? He said: I do not see anything wrong with that, because the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever buys foodstuff should not sell it until he acquires it,” but in this case they did not buy it; rather it is something that they are going to be given…\nMuhammad ibn Rushd said:\nAnother proof is the hadith of Marwan ibn al-Hakam about the sukuk (financial certificates or bonds) that had become common during his time in Madinah – which people would sell to one another before acquiring what was written in the bond, so Zayd ibn Thabit and one of the companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) went to visit Marwan and said: Do you permit selling with riba, O Marwan? And he said: I seek refuge with Allah! What do you mean? They said: These sukuk (bonds) that people are selling to one another, and they sell them before acquiring what is written on them. So Marwan sent the guards to track them down then take them away from people and return them to their original owners (narrated by Muslim). These sukuk (bonds) these were promissory notes in which it was written that some wealth from the treasury would be given to some of the people of Madinah, then the people sold these promissory notes, and selling them was permissible in the first instance, but if the one who bought it then sold it before acquiring what was written on it, the sale of it by the second one was haram. So Marwan issued orders that the second transaction be cancelled, and the bonds be returned to the first purchaser, and he did not cancel the sale of these notes by the initial recipients.""(Al-Bayan wa’t-Tahsil\xa0 7/355-357).\nSee the words of an-Nawawi – and more details about this issue – in the answer to question no. 98713 .\nThirdly:\nFrom the above it becomes clear that there is nothing wrong – in principle – with selling food coupons (or food stamps) because they are not cash, and they were not obtained by purchasing them. So the most correct view is that it is permissible to sell them. But we say that it is not permissible to sell them for a different reason, which is that according to the regulations of the government that issues these food stamps, it is not allowed to sell them, and they are given to poor people so that they can obtain food with them. So using them for any purpose other than that for which they were issued is not allowed according to the system, based on the fact that they are a gift to which conditions are attached. Therefore it is a must to adhere to the system and the conditions stipulated by the giver, and they should not be disposed of by selling them.\nBut the one who obtains these food stamps may dispose of them by consuming the food, or selling them, or giving them to whomever he wants, so long as he obtained them in accordance with the conditions stipulated by the giver.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/182467/is-it-permissible-to-sell-food-coupons-food-stamps-when-it-is-illegal-to-do-that
232749,What does trust (Amanah) mean? What is the punishment for one who betrays the trust? How can he repent? What is the evidence for all of that from the Quran and Sunnah?,"['Praise be to Allah.Meaning of trust in Islam\nTrust (Amanah) – in Islamic terms – has two meanings, a general meaning and a specific meaning.\n\nThe general meaning has to do with all commands and prohibitions of Islam.\n\nAmong the evidence for that is the verse in which Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Truly, We did offer Al-Amanah (the trust or moral responsibility or honesty and all the duties which Allah has ordained) to the heavens and the earth, and the mountains, but they declined to bear it and were afraid of it (i.e. afraid of Allah’s Torment). But man bore it. Verily, he was unjust (to himself) and ignorant (of its results).” [Al-Ahzab 33:72]\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) quoted a number of opinions of the earlier scholars concerning the interpretation of the word Amanah, then he said:\n“There is no contradiction between any of these views; rather they are all in harmony and boil down to the idea that what it refers to is responsibility and acceptance of all the commands and prohibitions with the conditions attached. This means that if the individual fulfils that commitment, he will be rewarded, but if he fails to do so, he will be punished. Man accepted this commitment despite his weakness, ignorance and wrongdoing, except for those whom Allah guides and helps. And Allah is the source of strength.” (Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 6/489)\nThis meaning is the one that was favoured by Ibn Jarir At-Tabari (may Allah have mercy on him), when he said:\n“The view that is most likely to be correct is the view of those who said that what is meant by the Amanah here is all types of trust, whether they have to do with matters of religion or with people’s rights. That is because when Allah said “We did offer Al-Amanah (the trust or moral responsibility or honesty and all the duties which Allah has ordained)”, He did not single out some of the meanings of Amanah to the exclusion of others.” (Tafsir At-Tabari, 19/204-205)\nAl-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“The word Amanah includes all religious duties, according to the correct scholarly view, which is the view of the majority.”\xa0 (Tafsir Al-Qurtubi, 17/244)\nAnd Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Those who are faithfully true to their Amanah (all the duties which Allah has ordained, honesty, moral responsibility and trusts etc.) and to their covenants.” [Al-Mu’minoon 23:8]\nShaykh Muhammad Al-Amin Ash-Shinqiti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“The Amanah includes everything that Allah has entrusted to you and instructed you to take care of. That includes guarding your physical faculties from engaging in anything that is not pleasing to Allah, and guarding anything that has been entrusted to you that has to do with the rights and dues of others.” (Adwa’ Al-Bayan, 5/846)\n\nWith regard to the specific meaning of Amanah or trust:\n\nThere are numerous Mutwawatir Islamic texts which enjoin paying attention to trusts and fulfilling them, and not neglecting or betraying them. That is widely discussed in the books of the scholars and jurists, and is widely spoken of among people in general. Perhaps this is what the questioner meant when he asked about Amanah or trusts.\nBased on that, what is meant by Amanah or trust in this sense is everything that the individual is obliged to take care of, uphold and fulfil of the rights of others.\nTypes of trust in Islam\nThere are three well-known scenarios with regard to Amanah or trust:\n\nFinancial rights that are established by contracts and covenants , such as items left with a person for safekeeping, loans, hiring and rentals, and so on; and those concerning which there is no contract, such as found items and what people pick up of the lost property of others.\n\nIt says in Al-Mawsu‘ah Al-Fiqhiyyah Al-Kuwaitiyyah (6/236):\n“From researching the issue, it becomes clear that the jurists use the word Amanah in the following senses:\n\nIn the sense of an item that is left in the possession of the person to whom it was entrusted. This may be with regard to one of the following scenarios\n\n\na contract in which the Amanah is the primary focus, which is when an item is left with a person for safe keeping. This is more specific than Amanah, because every item that is left with a person for safekeeping is an Amanah, but the converse is not necessarily true\n(b) \xa0a contract in which the Amanah is implied, but it is not the primary focus; rather it is connected to it as a consequence, such as renting, borrowing, profit sharing, appointing someone to act as an agent, partnerships and collateral for loans.\n(c) cases in which no contract is involved, such as picking up lost property, or that which the wind blows into a neighbour’s house. Such cases are called Shar`i trusts.”\xa0\n\n\nKeeping people’s secrets\n\nAbu Sa‘id Al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “One of the most evil people before Allah on the Day of Resurrection will be a man who is intimate with his wife and she is intimate with him, then he broadcasts her secrets.”\nJabir ibn ‘Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If a man says something then turns away, it becomes a trust [which should not be disclosed by the one who heard it] .” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 4868. Also narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 1959, who said: This is a sound Hadith. It was classed as authentic by Al-Albani in As-Silsilah As-Sahihah, 4868)\n\nPositions of responsibility, whether social, public or private\n\nOne should carry out such positions of trust and responsibility on a basis of truth and justice. A position of rulership is a trust, a judicial position is a trust, a management position in any organisation is a trust, responsibility for a family is a trust, and the same applies to all positions of responsibility.\nAbu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When Amanah is neglected, then await the Hour.” He said: How would they be neglected, O Messenger of Allah? He (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When positions of authority are given to people who are not qualified for them, then await the Hour.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 6496)\nAbu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I said: O Messenger of Allah, will you not appoint me (to a position of authority)? He struck me on the shoulder with his hand and said: “O Abu Dharr, you are weak and it is a trust, and on the Day of Resurrection it will be a source of humiliation and regret, except for the one who takes it and fulfils all obligations and does all duties required.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1825)\nImportance of taking care of trusts in slam\nWhat is required in the case of both public and private trusts is to take care of the trust and fulfil it in the proper manner as required by Shari`ah, and it is prohibited to neglect it or betray it.\nAllah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“O you who believe! Betray not Allah and His Messenger, nor betray knowingly your Amanat (things entrusted to you, and all the duties which Allah has ordained for you).” [Al-Anfal 8:27]\n“Verily! Allah commands that you should render back the trusts to those, to whom they are due.” [An-Nisa’ 4:58]\nBetrayal of trusts is one of the signs of hypocrisy.\xa0 `Abdullah ibn `Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) said that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There are four characteristics, whoever has them all is a pure hypocrite, and whoever has one of them has one of the characteristics of hypocrisy, until he gives it up: when he makes a covenant he betrays it, when he speaks he lies, when he makes a promise he breaks it, and when he disputes he resorts to obscene speech.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 34 and Muslim, 58)\nIs betrayal of trust in Islam a major sin?\nBetrayal of trust is a sin, and in fact it is a major sin. Although it is a grave sin, the gate of repentance is open .\nAllah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Say: ""O My slaves who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allah, verily Allah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” [Az-Zumar 39:53]\n“And He it is Who accepts repentance from His slaves, and forgives sins, and He knows what you do.” [Ash-Shura 42:25]\nAbu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever repents before the sun rises from its place of setting, Allah will accept his repentance .” (Narrated by Muslim, 2703)\nSincere repentance means hastening to give up the sin, regretting it , and resolving not to go back to it. Then the sinner who neglected the trust should see whether the trust that he neglected has to do with the rights of Allah, in which case – in addition to repenting and seeking forgiveness – he should find out if there are any Shar`i requirements that he must fulfil in order to make up for this negligence, such as making up (missed obligatory deeds) or offering expiation.\nFor example, if someone neglects the trust of fasting, by breaking the fast deliberately during Ramadan, then – in addition to repenting – he must make up for the days that he did not fast. If his breaking of the fast was done by having intercourse, then he must offer the required expiation. This is also applicable to all other shar‘i matters that he neglected.\nBut if the trust that he betrayed has to do with the rights of people, then – in addition to what is explained above about repentance – he must also fulfil that right and give that person his dues, or ask him to let him off and forgive him.\nAbu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever has wronged someone with regard to his honour or anything else, let him ask for his forgiveness today, before (a Day when) there will be no Dinar and no Dirham, and if he has any righteous deeds to his credit, they will be taken from him, commensurate with the wrong that he did, and if he does not have any good deeds to his credit, some of the bad deeds of his opposite number will be taken and added to his burden.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 2449)\nConditions of repentance in Islam\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“The scholars said: Repentance is obligatory from all sins. If the sin has to do with a matter that is between the individual and Allah, may He be Exalted, and does not have to do with the rights of other people, then three conditions must be met :\n\nhe must give up the sin\nhe must regret what he has done\nhe must resolve never to go back to it.\n\nIf one of these three is missing, then his repentance is not valid.\nBut if the sin has to do with other people, then four conditions must be met: the three mentioned above, and he must also absolve himself of any wrongdoing and pay his dues to the one whom he wronged. If it is a matter of money and the like, then he must return it to him. If it has to do with punishment for slandering him and the like, he should submit to the punishment to be carried out on him, or seek that person’s forgiveness. If it is the matter of backbiting , he must ask him to forgive him for it.” (Riyadh As-Saliheen, p. 14)\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/232749/trust-in-islam
289281,"Is the verse {for the male, what is equal to the share of two females} [An-Nisa’ 4:11], applicable only to the shares of inheritance, or does it apply to all other issues? For example, when a father gives pocket money to his children, should he give the boys ten and the girls five? Is that permissible, noting that the girls are older?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Allah instructs you concerning your children: for the male, what is equal to the share of two females}\xa0[An-Nisa’ 4:11].\nThis verse has to do with the division of the estate. In the event of the father’s death, what he leaves behind is to be divided amongst his children in this manner.\nSecondly:\nWith regard to what a father gives to his children when he is still alive, it is of two types:\nThe first type:\nis what he gives them by way of maintenance, which the father is obliged to provide for his children. This is to be done according to need. A daughter may need more than a son, or vice versa, according to the need of each of them.\nIt says in al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah al-Kuwaitiyyah (41/81):\nThe jurists are unanimously agreed that what is required with regard to the maintenance of relatives is what is sufficient of bread, condiments, clothing, shelter and breastfeeding, for an infant, because there is a need for these things, and they are to be estimated according to what meets the need. End quote.\nBased on that, if the children’s needs are equal, then the father must give equally to males and females. If their needs are different, then he must give each of them as much as will meet their needs.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThere is another type of need which applies equally to all the children, namely the case of gifts, maintenance or arranging marriages. Undoubtedly, in that case, it is haram to differentiate between them.""(Al-Fatawa al-Kubra\xa0 5/435).\nOne example of that is what a father gives to his children – as mentioned in the question – of pocket money. This comes under the heading of maintenance, so the share of the male does not have to be the share of two females; rather the father should look at what each of his children needs, and give him what will suffice him, taking into account the child’s age and gender, because in this regard, one who is younger is not like one who is older, and one who is male is not like one who is female. The father should strive to be equitable in that regard. He may think that being equitable means giving each child, male or female, the same, if they are close in age.\nThe second type:\nis what the father gives to his children by way of showing kindness, without it being based on the need that calls for that. This refers to gift giving, in which Islam teaches parents to treat their children equitably. So it is not permissible to give to one child and not to another, because of the hadith of an-Nu‘man ibn Bashir (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: My father gave me a gift, but [my mother] ‘Amrah bint Rawahah said: I will not approve until you ask the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to bear witness. So my father went to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and said: I have given a gift to my son from ‘Amrah bint Rawahah, but she told me to ask you to bear witness, O Messenger of Allah. He said: “Have you given a similar gift to all your children?”\nHe said: No.\nHe said: “Fear Allah and treat your children fairly.” So he came back and took back his gift.\nNarrated by al-Bukhari (2587) and Muslim (1623).\nAccording to a report narrated by Abu Dawud (3544) from an-Nu‘man ibn Bashir, he said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Treat your children fairly, treat your children fairly.”\nThe scholars differed as to how the father should treat his children fairly in this case. Does fairness mean giving the same to males and females, or does it mean giving according to the division of the shares of inheritance, with the male receiving the share of two females?\nMuhammad ibn al-Hasan, the companion of Abu Hanifah, and a number of the Malikis, Shafa‘is and Hanbalis – according to their famous view – were of the view that fairness means giving in accordance with the shares of inheritance, with the male receiving the share of two females.\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThen they differed as to what is meant by giving equally. Muhammad ibn al-Hasan, Ahmad, Ishaq and some of the Shafa‘is and Malikis said: Fairness means giving the male two shares, like the shares of inheritance. They quoted as evidence the fact that this is what the female’s share of that wealth would be if the giver left it behind when he died.""(Fath al-Bari\xa0 5/214).\nSome scholars are of the view that fairness means giving equal shares. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nChildren should be given according to what Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, said in His Book about inheritance: {for the male, what is equal to the share of two females} [An-Nisa’ 4:11]. Undoubtedly nothing is more fair than the way in which Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, divided the shares of inheritance. Whoever says that there is a difference between when the parent is alive and when he is dead must provide evidence for that. Hence we say: in life and after death, it is the same.""(Ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘\xa0 11/80).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/289281/giving-the-son-the-share-of-two-daughters-is-that-only-applicable-to-the-shares-of-inheritance
258503,"What is the evidence for following the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in his actions, especially since there is a difference of opinion concerning the principle that what matters is the general meaning (not the specific reason for a particular teaching)?","['Praise be to Allah.Types of Actions of Prophet Muhammad\nThe actions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) are of different types. Some of them are prescriptive (meaning that they set an example to be followed and are part of the teachings of Islam); some of them are things that he did because he was a human being (and these things are dictated by human nature), such as eating and sleeping; and some of them are things that may be understood either as being prescriptive or being because he was human, such as his going for Hajj riding, or his lying down after the Sunnah prayer of Fajr.\nWith regard to the actions that were purely prescriptive – such as his prayer, fasting, Hajj and Adhkar – and things that he encouraged his Ummah to do in conjunction with some acts of worship – such as using the Siwak, mentioning the name of Allah when starting to eat, entering the mosque with the right foot first, and so on – the basic principle is that we are to follow him in them, because Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“There has certainly been for you in the Messenger of Allah an excellent pattern for anyone whose hope is in Allah and the Last Day and [who] remembers Allah often.” [Al-Ahzab 33:21]\n“Say, [O Muhammad], `If you should love Allah , then follow me, [so] Allah will love you and forgive you your sins. And Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.’” [Al `Imran 3:31]\n“And whatever the Messenger has given you – take.” [Al-Hashr 59:7]\nWith regard to natural human actions, such as eating, drinking, sleeping, walking and so on, we are not required to follow his example in that regard.\nWith regard to actions that could be either prescriptive or human, there is a difference of scholarly opinion concerning them.\nIt says in Maraqi As-Su`ud [in verse]:\nThe actions he [the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)] did as a human, such as eating and drinking, are not prescriptive,\nwhen there is no description of how to do these human actions, in which case they could be prescriptive, and there is some scholarly discussion about that.\nSo doing Hajj riding is part of that, as is lying down after Fajr.\n“when there is no description of how to do these human actions” means: eating, in principle, is a human action, but eating with the right hand, eating from what is closest to you and mentioning the name of Allah before starting to eat are matters in which it is prescribed to follow his example.\nShaykh Al-Amin Ash-Shinqiti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“As to whether the actions of the Prophet are human or prescriptive, his actions fall into three categories:\n\nThe first category is actions that are purely human, by which I mean actions that are dictated by human nature, such as standing, sitting, eating and drinking. These actions were not done to prescribe or set an example to be followed. No one says: “I am sitting or standing as a way of drawing closer to Allah and following the example of His Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) because he used to stand and sit”, because he did not do that for the purpose of prescribing or setting an example to be followed. Some of the scholars said that his human actions indicate that those actions are permissible, and others said that it indicates that they are recommended.\n\nWhat appears to be the correct view is what we have mentioned, which is that he did not do those things for the purpose of prescribing, but they indicate that those actions are permissible.\n\nThe second category is actions that are purely for the purpose of prescription (and form part of the teachings of Islam). These are actions that he did for the purpose of setting an example to be followed and prescribing those actions, such as the actions of the prayer and the actions of Hajj, in addition to which he said: “Pray as you have seen me praying” and “Learn from me your rituals of Hajj.”\nThe third category is what is referred to here, namely actions that could be interpreted as being simply human or as being for the purpose of prescribing.\n\nThe guideline here is that human nature inherently dictates these actions, but they are connected to an act of worship, in the sense that they happen within the act of worship or are means of doing that act of worship, such as riding to perform Hajj. The Prophet’s riding to perform Hajj may be interpreted as being due to being human, because being human dictates that one must ride (to cover great distances), as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) rode in all his journeys, without that riding being done as an act of worship; rather it was because being human dictated that. Or it may be interpreted as being a prescriptive action, because he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did that in conjunction with performing Hajj, and he said: “Learn from me your rituals of Hajj.”\nMinor issues connected to this matter include: Jalsat Al-Istirahah in prayer [a brief sitting after two prostrations in any Rak`ah where there is no Tashahhud]; returning from the `Eid prayer via a route different from the route one took to get to the prayer; lying on one’s right side between the Sunnah prayer of Fajr and the obligatory Fajr prayer; entering Makkah from Kada’ and leaving from Kuda; halting in Al-Muhassab after leaving Mina, and so on.\nConcerning all these issues there is a difference of opinion among the scholars, because of the possibility that they may be either due to being human or they may be prescriptive actions .” ( Adwa’ Al-Bayan (4/300)\nAll rulings apply to the Prophet as well as his ummah\nThe basic principle is that all rulings apply to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) as well as his Ummah, except when there is evidence to indicate that a ruling applies specifically to him. Hence the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) used to follow his example in everything that he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did, and they did not ask whether this action was exclusively for him or not. For example, in the Hadith of Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him), we see that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) took off his shoes [during the prayer], and the people also took off their shoes. When he finished the prayer, he said: “Why did you take off your shoes?” They said: O Messenger of Allah, we saw you take off your shoes, so we took off our shoes. He (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Jibril came to me and told me that there was some filth on them. When one of you enters the mosque, let him turn up his shoes and look at them; if he sees some filth on them, let him wipe it on the ground, then pray wearing them.” (Narrated by Ahmad, 17/242, 243; classed as authentic by the commentators on Al-Musnad)\nIn fact, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) got angry with some of his companions when they interpreted something that he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did as being exclusively for him.\nIt was narrated from `Aishah, the wife of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), that a man said to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): O Messenger of Allah, (sometimes) I wake up Junub (in a state of impurity due to sexual activity or a wet dream), and want to fast. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “(Sometimes) I also wake up Junub and want to fast, so I do ghusl and fast.” The man said: O Messenger of Allah, you are not like us! Allah has forgiven you your past and future sins. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “By Allah, I hope that I am the most fearing of Allah and the most knowledgeable of you all in what I follow.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 2389; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud)\nIbn Hazm (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “It is not permissible to say concerning anything that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did that it was exclusive to him unless there is a text to that effect, because he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) got angry with the one who said that, and whatever angered the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is prohibited.” (Al-Ihkam fi Usul Al-Ahkam (4/433)\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The basic principle is that the rulings that applied to his Ummah also applied to him, except where the evidence indicates that something applied only to him . Hence Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) said to him [at Al-Hudaybiyyah]: Go out and do not speak to anyone until you have shaved your head and offered your sacrifice – because she knew that the people would follow his lead.” (Zad Al-Ma`ad)\nIf it was not an action dictated by being human, then the Prophetic action is an example to be followed\nEverything that was narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is subject to the discussion mentioned above. If it was not an action dictated by being human, then it is an example to be followed, unless there is evidence to prove that it applied only to him. It makes no difference whether the action was narrated from a group of the Companions who saw him or only one of them saw him (and narrated it).\nThe basic principle is that urination is an inherently human action, but the way in which it is to be done – standing or sitting – is a matter that is addressed by Islamic teachings and has to do with following the example of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), because it is narrated that it is prohibited to urinate whilst standing, and this instruction is prescriptive and must be followed. Then it was proven that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did that whilst standing. So in this case we must see how to reconcile between the reports.\nIbn Majah narrated (309) that Jabir ibn `Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade us to urinate whilst standing. But this Hadith was classed as inauthentic. Al-Busayri (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Az-Zawa’id: The [scholars] unanimously agreed that it is inauthentic. Al-Albani said: “It is very inauthentic.”\nAt-Tirmidhi (12) narrated that `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) saw me urinating whilst standing, and he said: “O `Umar, do not urinate whilst standing.” So I never urinated whilst standing again after that. This Hadith was classed as inauthentic by At-Tirmidhi and Al-Albani.\nAl-Bazzar (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated from Buraydahr (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “It is uncouth for a man to urinate whilst standing.” At-Tirmidhi referred to this Hadith and said that it is not known.\nBased on that, the prohibition on urinating whilst standing is not soundly narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nBut At-Tirmidhi (12) and An-Nasa’i (29) narrated that `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: Whoever tells you that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to urinate whilst standing, do not believe him; he only ever urinated whilst sitting. (Classed as authentic by At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa’i)\nAsh-Shawkani (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Nayl Al-Awtar (1/16): “This Hadith indicates that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not urinate whilst standing; rather it was his practice to sit when he urinating, so urinating whilst standing is disliked.”\nThe fact that it is permissible to urinate whilst standing is indicated by the report narrated by Al-Bukhari (224) and Muslim (273) from Hudhayfah\xa0 (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came to the garbage-dump of some people, and urinated whilst standing, then he called for water. I brought some water to him and he did Wudu’.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“The concession allowing this has been narrated from `Umar, `Ali, Ibn `Umar, Zayd ibn Thabit, Sahl ibn Sa`d, Anas, Abu Hurayrah and `Urwah\xa0 (may Allah be pleased with them).\nHudhayfah\xa0 (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came to the garbage-dump of some people and urinated whilst standing. This was narrated by Al-Bukhari and others.\nPerhaps the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did that in order to highlight that it is permissible, and he only did it once. Or it may be that he was in a place where it was not possible to sit.\nIt was said that he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did that because of a pain in the hollow at the back of his knee (popliteal space).” (Al-Mughni (1/108)\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “It is proven from `Umar, `Ali, Zayd ibn Thabit and others that they urinated whilst standing , which indicates that it is permissible and is not disliked, if there is no risk of it splashing back. And Allah knows best.\nThere is no proven report from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to indicate that it is prohibited. And Allah knows best.” (Fath al-Bari (1/330)\nGet rid of Satanic whispers\nIt is essential to beware of waswasah (intrusive thoughts), for it is a disease and an evil thing. Seeking to understand the religion, learning about the Sunnah and following the example of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) does not come under the heading of Waswasah .\nMay Allah increase you in knowledge and make you more keen to do good.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/258503/types-of-actions-of-prophet-muhammad
