127884,"I want to ask about the service offered by one of the mobile phone networks in Egypt, which is called “Sallifni…Shukran (lit. Give me a loan… Thank you).”  With this service, the user can borrow three Egyptian pounds, if his phone no longer has credit, and he pays it back after he load the card. But the actual value that is loaned is 2.50 Egyptian pounds, because the cost of the service is 0.50 pounds. Is this regarded as riba (usury)?","['Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with subscribing to this service, because it is selling a service and is not selling money for money. Moreover, it is not a loan, because the company is providing telephone service for a deferred payment of a higher price than if one is paying with cash up front. The benefit of connection to the service, of which the value is 2.50 pounds, is being sold for 3.00 pounds to be paid later, which the company will receive from the customer after he loads his mobile phone. This transaction is permissible.\nThe company is not really lending you money, then taking it back later on with something extra, such that it could be said that it is riba. Rather it is selling you a service at a higher price, and there is nothing wrong with increasing the price in return for a deferral of payment.\nIn Qararat Majma` Al-Fiqh Al-Islami, no. 51 (2/6) it says:\nIt is permissible to charge more for deferred payment than the price if it is paid up front. (End quote from Qararat Majma` Al-Fiqh Al-Islami, p. 109).\nThe reason for the confusion about this issue is calling this transaction a loan (Salaf). It is not correct to call it this; rather it is selling a benefit [phone service] for a deferred payment that is higher than the price if it is paid up front.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/127884/ruling-on-subscribing-to-the-mobile-phone-service-called-sallifnishukran
119830,What is the ruling on eating the meat of animals that have been fed with plants that have been genetically modified?,"['Praise be to Allah.Understanding Genetically Modified Foods\nResearch is still ongoing into the effect of genetically modified plants on humans, plants, animals and the environment, and even on the economy. There are still specialists who advise not hastening to accept what appears to be the case with regard to genetically modified plants of abundant production and the ability to overcome defects and resist disease.\xa0\nGlobal Perspective on GMOs\nThere are two main points of view with regard to this issue: the first is that which is adopted by American companies and American government organisations, which is to allow the use of genetically modified plants and marketing of their products. The other view, which is the opposite view, is that which is adopted by the European Union, which bans cultivation (of genetically modified plants) in its territory and warns against its possible consequences.\xa0\nThe matter is still not definitive with regard to its effects, because it needs years for the impact to materialise, according to specialists. The fact that we have some plants which are more resistant to pesticides means that they will be used a great deal, which will pose a danger to the environment and human health. The fact that the plant has this strength means that it will enter the body of the one that eats it. As is well known, the countries that import these plants will never be able to plant the seeds of these plants in their lands again. What this means is that they will remain under the control and domination of the companies that produce these seeds, and this is what will affect the quality of the plants produced and will affect the economy of the importing country, as it will continue importing and consuming, and not producing independently.\xa0\nThe Arab Organisation for Agricultural Development held a conference in Sudan 15-17/6/2003 CE, the subject of which was: Evaluating the Environmental Impact of Introducing Various Kinds of Genetically Modified Plants and Animals.\xa0\nWe will quote from that conference statements which will explain this issue, before ruling on what was mentioned in the question.\xa0\n\n\xa0(On p. 45) Dr. `Awad-Allah ibn `Abdullah `Abd Al-Mawla — Prof of Horticulture and Genetics in the College of Agriculture, Khartoum University — says:\n\nWhat are genetically modified products?\nThis is a phrase which refers to the products of some crops which have been genetically engineered, which means introducing a foreign gene to the original genetic material. The foreign gene may come from different sources, and is introduced to increase the value and improve the genetic qualities of the genetically engineered plant. Usually plants are genetically altered for two purposes, namely:\n\nTo reduce the cost of producing these plants, by making the plant resistant to disease.\nTo improve the quality of the product, by improving its appearance or nutritional components with regard to qualities that have to do with manufacturing and storage.\n\nProduction of these genetically modified products is done using genetic engineering techniques. This involves first identifying the gene responsible for the desired quality and isolating it, then introducing it to the living being (the receiver). After this new gene has been mixed with the genetic material of the genetically engineered plant, it is possible to increase the number of cells in which the new gene is successfully mixed, then by means of tissue planting it becomes possible to produce complete plants from the cells, and these plants become genetically modified or engineered. Once this gene becomes well established in the genetically engineered plant, it becomes possible to transfer it to other types of the same crop by using traditional methods of raising plants, by means of hybridisation and crossbreeding.\xa0\n\nIn a paper entitled Genetic Modification: Justifications, Benefits and its Impact on the Environment and Society, by Dr. Lakhdar Khalifi and Dr. Majidah Khalifi, it says (p. 15):\n\nIn the field of genetic modification in particular, there is a clear difference between American and European law. Whilst American law regards genetically modified foods as natural foods that do not pose any danger until proven otherwise, European law — especially French law — regards genetically modified foods as unnatural and a possible source of danger until proven otherwise. End quote.\xa0\nIs Genetically Modified Food Permissible in Islam?\nThe one who researches this issue cannot state that it is prohibited to eat genetically modified crops and fruits unless it is proven for certain that they are harmful. This does not mean that we can be careless about this matter, because of what we have pointed out above of the possibility that they may pose a danger in many ways, and because people still prefer natural plants and crops, and people like them even if they are more expensive.\xa0\nThe matter still needs more research and more time until the effects of these plants and the harm they may cause becomes clear.\xa0\nUntil it is proven that they are harmful, the basic principle is that these plants are permissible and it is permissible to eat animals that have been fed on these plants, but it is also essential to be cautious about what these plants may cause in the future, and it is essential to follow up on research and information about these plants.\xa0\nFor more details, please see the following answers:\xa021582 , 119830 , 155691 , 308325 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/119830/is-genetically-modified-food-permissible-in-islam
83154,What is the ruling on praying in clothes on which there are images of some animals which may be part of a manufacturing company’s logo such as tigers or crocodiles?.,"['Praise be to Allah.Can you wear clothes with images?\nIt is not permissible to wear clothes on which there are images of animals or people , because of the report narrated by Al-Bukhari (3226) and Muslim (2106) from Abu Talhah (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The angels do not enter any house in which there is an image.”\xa0(Matalib Uli An-Nuha, 1/353)\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about the ruling on wearing clothes on which there are images of animals or people. He replied: It is not permissible for a person to wear clothes on which there is an image of an animal or a person, and it is not permissible to wear Ghutrahs or other headgear on which there is an image of a person or an animal, because it is proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The angels do not enter any house in which there is an image.”\xa0\nHence, we do not think that anyone should keep pictures for memories , as they say, and whoever has any pictures for memories should destroy them, whether he put them on the wall or in an album etc, because keeping them deprives the people of the house of the angels’ entering upon them. And Allah knows best. End quote\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) was also asked about the ruling on children wearing clothes on which there are images of animate beings.\nHe replied:\xa0\nThe scholars said that it is prohibited to dress a child in what it is prohibited for adults to wear. Whatever has an image on it, it is prohibited for adults to wear it, so it is also prohibited for children to wear it. This is the answer. What the Muslims should do is to boycott these clothes and shoes, so that the evildoers will have no means of reaching us in this matter. If they are boycotted they will never find a way of bringing them into this land, because when they are boycotted there will be no point in bringing them here. (End quote from Majmu` Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin,\xa0 12/333)\xa0\nIs the payer offered in clothes with images valid?\nPrayer offered in a garment that has images of people or animals on it is valid, but there is some sin involved.\xa0\nThe Scholars of the Standing Committee were asked: Is it permissible to pray in a garment on which there is an image of a person or images of animals? Is it permissible to enter the toilet in a garment on which there is the name of Allah?\xa0\nThey replied:\xa0\nIt is not permissible to pray in clothes on which there are images of animate beings , whether people, birds, camels, cattle, sheep, or other animate beings, and it is not permissible for a Muslim to wear them when he is not praying either.\xa0\nThe prayer of one who prays wearing clothes on which there are images is valid, but he is sinning if he knows the Shar`i ruling. It is not permissible to write the name of Allah on clothing, and it is disliked to enter the toilet wearing it, because that is showing disrespect to His name, may He be Exalted. (End quote from\xa0Fatawa Al-Lajnah Al-Da’imah, 6/179)\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about the ruling on the prayer of one who prays in a garment on which are embroidered or printed images of animate beings .\xa0\nHe replied:\xa0\nIf he is unaware, there is no sin on him, but if he knew (the ruling) then his prayer is valid but there is some sin involved, according to the more correct of the two scholarly rulings. Some scholars said that his prayer is invalid, because he has prayed in a garment that is prohibited for him. (End quote from Majmu` Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin, 12/360)\xa0\nBased on this, you have to remove the image of the tiger or crocodile from your clothes , or distort the image by removing the head or covering it with some colour or thread that will hide it. If you pray with the image still on your clothes, your prayer is valid but there is some sin.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/83154/can-you-pray-with-pictures-on-your-clothes
20620,Is it permissible to recite the holy Quran while in the toilet (without taking the book itself in)?,"['Praise be to Allah.The sacredness of the Quran\nThe Quran is the best book that mankind has ever known, because it is the Word of the Lord of the Universe, which was brought down by the trustworthy Spirit [i.e., Jibril] to the heart of the noble Messenger, to bring mankind forth from darkness into light, and guide them to the straight path.\xa0\nIt is the Book whose miracle abides, the proof of which is constantly renewed; Falsehood cannot come to it from before it or behind it, (it is) sent down by the All Wise, Worthy of all praise (Allah) [cf.

One of these rules is that the place where it is recited should be clean. In his valuable book At-Tibyan, Imam An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) mentioned some of the etiquette which the Muslim should pay attention to when reciting the Book of Allah. He mentioned the issue of reciting Quran in bathrooms and toilets , and he quoted the views of scholars on this matter. He said:\n“It is recommended to recite the Quran in a place that is clean and suitable. Hence a number of scholars regarded it as recommended to read the Quran in the mosque because it is both clean and a honourable environment… With regard to reciting the Quran in the bathroom, the Salaf differed as to whether it is disliked. Our companions – i.e., the Shafi`is – said that it is not disliked. This was quoted by Abu Bakr ibn Al-Mundhir in Al-Ishraf from Ibrahim An-Nakh`i and Malik, and it is the view of `Ata’.\nSome regarded it as disliked, such as `Ali ibn Abع Talib (may Allah be pleased with him).

(Narrated by At-Tirmidhi (2058); Al-Albani classed it as authentic in Sahih At-Tirmidhi)\nBlowing with some saliva [into one’s cupped hands] and reciting the Mu`awwidhatayn is based on the practice of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) just before going to sleep. He used to recite [the Mu`awwidhatayn] into his cupped hands and blow into them, then he would wipe his blessed body with them. When he fell sick, ‘Aa’ishah would do that for him, which indicates that for a child, his mother can recite the Mu`awwidhatayn and blow into her cupped hands, then wipe the child with them.\nIt was narrated that `Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: When the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) went to his bed, he would blow into his cupped hands and recite Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad [Al-Ikhlas] and the Mu`awwidhatayn, then he would wipe his face and whatever of his body his hands could reach. ‘Aa’ishah said: When he fell sick, he would tell me to do that for him.

163573,"I wanted to ask whether it is allowed to say ""Bismillahir-Rahmanir-Rahim"" instead of ""Bismillah"" before one eats. There was a discussion between a sister and me, and I said it is a Bida, but the sister insisted that there is nothing wrong with that. What is the right ruling on this issue?","['Praise be to Allah.Significance of saying Bismillah before eating\nThe phrase that is prescribed for mentioning Allah when eating is to say “Bismillah ” (In the name of Allah), because of the report narrated by `A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When one of you eats some food, let him say Bismillah , and if he forgets to do so at the beginning, let him say Bismillah fi awwalihi wa akhirihi (In the name of Allah at the beginning and end).

Most of the scholars are of the view that there is nothing wrong with this addition.\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If one says when eating, Bismillah Ar-Rahman Ar-Rahim, that is good and more perfect. (End quote from Al-Fatawa Al-Kubra, 5/480)\xa0\nIt says in Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah, (8/92): The jurists are of the view that mentioning the name of Allah when beginning to eat is a Sunnah, and the phrase to be used is Bismillah or Bismillah Ar-Rahman Ar-Rahim.

The best of guidance is the guidance of Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and if nothing is proven concerning mentioning the name of Allah when eating except to say “Bismillah,” then it is not permissible to add anything to it, let alone suggest that the longer phrase is better than it, because saying such a thing is contrary to what is referred to in the Hadith: “The best of guidance is the guidance of Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).” (End quote from As-Silsilah As-Sahihah, 1/343)\nBased on this, it is better to limit it to saying Bismillah when starting to eat, and not add anything to it.
