423150,Is it permissible for a patient who takes narcotic medicine to pray?,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe basic principle is that it is not permissible to take narcotic medicines or drugs, especially if their effect is powerful and has a clear impact on the patient’s consciousness and understanding.\nBut if it is necessary, and the doctors have decided that the patient should take this narcotic medicine, and there is no non-narcotic alternative, then it is permissible for him to take it, subject to certain conditions.\nIt was stated in the Eighth Medical Fiqh Conference: An Islamic View of some Medical Problems – which was held in Kuwait –:\nNarcotic substances are prohibited, and it is not permissible to take them except for the purpose of specific medical treatment, in the amounts prescribed by the doctors, if they are pure (tahir) in and of themselves.""(Al-Fiqh al-Islami wa Adillatuhu, Wahbah az-Zuhayli 7/5266).\nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 192321 .\nSecondly:\nWith regard to the validity of the prayer of someone who takes a narcotic medicine at the time when he is taking it, there are two scenarios:\nThe first scenario is where he becomes unconscious when taking it, or he does not fully know what he is saying or doing. In this case his prayer is not valid until he comes back to full consciousness and awareness, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {O you who have believed, do not approach prayer while you are intoxicated until you know what you are saying} [An-Nisa’ 4:43].\nThe second scenario is where he knows fully what he is saying and doing when he takes the narcotic medicine. In this case, his prayer is valid. The scholars have stated that the prayer of one who is intoxicated is valid if he is aware of what he is saying, so that is more likely to be applicable in this case.\nAsh-Shafa‘i (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If someone who has drunk something haram prays and is not intoxicated, he is sinning for having drunk that haram thing, but he does not have to repeat his prayer.""(Al-Umm\xa0 1/88).\nShaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about the one who prays after having drunk alcohol when he is aware of what he is saying. He replied: His prayer is valid if he prayed when he was sober and the drunkenness had left him; he may do wudu’ and pray. But if he is in a state of intoxication, then his prayer is not valid because he is not aware of what he is saying.""(Fatawa Nur ‘ala ad-Darb by Ibn Baz\xa0 6/25).\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah stated that the prayer of one who has consumed alcohol or hashish is valid if he prays when he knows what he is saying.\nSee: Majmu‘ al-Fatawa (33/103; 23/358).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/423150/is-the-patients-prayer-valid-if-he-takes-narcotic-medicine
140183,"Is it permissible to recite ruqyah for one of my family members or for my entire family, whether inside or outside the house, without being near them? That is because there is sihr (witchcraft) which is causing division in the entire family. Can this ruqyah have an impact on them remotely?","['Praise be to Allah.The Sunnah and the practice of the early generations was to recite ruqyah directly over the sick person. There is nothing in the Sunnah to indicate that it is permissible to do ruqyah remotely.\nHence the scholars of the Permanent Committee for Ifta’ said:\nRuqyah must be done directly over the sick person, and it cannot be done via loudspeakers or over the phone, because this is contrary to what the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), his companions (may Allah be pleased with them) and those who followed them in truth did with regard to ruqyah. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever introduces anything into this matter of ours that is not part of it will have it rejected.”(Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah\xa01/92).\nWhat benefits the one who is not present is supplication (du‘a’). So you may offer supplication for your entire family, asking Allah to heal them, grant them well-being, keep them safe and sound, and so on, because supplication is valid and will benefit both those who are present and those who are absent. In fact, the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said regarding the Muslim’s supplication for his fellow Muslim in his absence: “A Muslim’s prayer for his brother in his absence will be answered. At his head there is an angel who is appointed, and when he prays for good for his brother, the angel who is appointed says: Amin, and may you have something similar.” Narrated by Muslim (2733).\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThis highlights the virtue of offering supplication for one’s Muslim brother in his absence. If he offers supplication for a group of Muslims, this virtue will be attained, and if he offer supplication for a number of Muslims, what appears to be the case is that this virtue will also be attained. One of the early generations, when he wanted to offer supplication for himself, would offer supplication for his Muslim brother at the same time, because that supplication would be answered and he would attain something similar. End quote.\nIf there is the fear of the evil eye or witchcraft, then the entire family should regularly recite the adhkar that are prescribed, such as the adhkar following prayer, the adhkar of morning and afternoon, the adhkar before going to sleep, the mu‘awwidhat and a great deal of Qur’an. They should think positively of Allah, put their trust in Him, and realize that if the entire nation were to come together to harm someone, they would not be able to harm him except with something that Allah has decreed for him.\nFor more information on the way to treat witchcraft, please see the answer to question no. 11290 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/140183/is-it-permissible-to-recite-ruqyah-in-absentia-for-someone
