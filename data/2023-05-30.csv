272976,"I read on Islamic websites a number of fatwas which say that if istinja’ water enters the penis then comes out of it, it is regarded as impure (najis) and invalidates wudu’. This is what is making me very anxious, because when I have a bath or clean myself after relieving myself (istinja’), I noticed that some water enters the opening of the penis and remains inside it, then it comes out of it. There is no doubt about that; rather it is something certain, one million per cent. I asked a doctor and he told me that this water does not enter the urethra. This means that the water only enters the opening of the penis, but it does not enter the urethra itself. I have also noticed that there is always some moisture in the opening of the penis, at times other than cleaning myself after relieving myself or taking a bath. After lengthy research and asking a doctor, I came to know that the opening of the penis on the inside has a mucous membrane lining which produces moisture to protect this area, like the moisture inside the mouth. This moisture does not worry me at all, because it does not come out of the opening of the penis. But the problem is the fact that this moisture is present in the urethra, i.e., in the place of impurity (najasah), and when having a bath or cleaning myself after relieving myself, some of the water enters the opening of the penis, and thus comes into contact with this moisture. My question is twofold: Firstly, what is the ruling on the water that enters the opening of the penis when having a bath or cleaning myself after relieving myself – does it become impure (najis) as a result of coming into contact with the moisture that is present inside the opening of the penis, through which urine has passed? Secondly, can we say that the water that enters the opening of the penis then comes out of it does not invalidate wudu’ so long as it does not go all the way back to the urethra itself, and that its entry is limited only to the opening of the penis? In other words, is what matters in invalidating wudu’ the urethra or the opening of the penis?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIf someone causes water, oil or anything else to enter the urethra, then it comes out, it is impure (najis) and invalidates wudu’.\nIbn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If he drops oil into his urethra, then it comes out again, it invalidates wudu’, because it came out of the passage, which cannot be free of some impure wetness that accompanies it. Therefore wudu’ is invalidated thereby, just as when only impurity (najasah) comes out.""(Al-Mughni\xa0 1/125).\nThis applies if the water reaches the inside, in the sense that when it comes out it is regarded as coming out from the passage. But if it only reaches the opening of the penis, which is regarded as pure (tahir), and it does not go any deeper, then it has no impact.\nWhat you have mentioned is no more than intrusive thoughts (waswasah), because it is difficult for water to enter inside the penis, unless the individual deliberately makes an effort to do that.\nIf we assume that that happened, then what you must do is relieve yourself after doing ghusl, and clean yourself (istinja’) by washing the tip of the penis without opening it or examining it, and you should not do anything other than that, otherwise you will be opening the door to intrusive thoughts.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Majmu‘ al-Fatawa (21/106): Examining the penis and squeezing out the last drop of urine, and the like, is all an innovation (bid‘ah) that is not required or recommended according to the leading scholars of the Muslims. moreover, by the same token, shaking the penis is also an innovation according to the correct view, and it was not prescribed by the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nSimilarly, expressing the urine is an innovation that was not prescribed by the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). The hadith which speaks of that is da‘if (weak) and has no basis. The urine comes out naturally, and when one has finished it stops naturally. As it was said, it is like the udder, if you leave it alone it will dry up, but if you squeeze it, milk will flow.\nEvery time the individual opens the opening of his penis, something may come out, but if he leaves it alone nothing will come out. He may imagine that something has come out, but this is intrusive thoughts.\nThe one who experiences that may feel some coolness at the tip of the penis and think that something has come out of it, when nothing has come out.\nUrine may be retained at the top of the urethra and not drip, but if he squeezes the penis or the opening with a rock, finger or anything else, some moisture will come out. This is also an innovation, and that retained urine that does not need to be forced out, according to scholarly consensus, either with a rock or a finger or anything else. Rather every time he forces it out, more will come, for it is dripping all the time. Cleaning oneself with stones is sufficient and there is no need to wash the penis with water. It is recommended for the one who does use water to sprinkle water on his private part, then if he feels any moisture, he can say: it is from that water. End quote.\nSecondly:\nWater that remains on the penis after purifying it is deemed to be pure, because water that is separate from the impurity after cleaning it is pure (tahir).\nThirdly:\nAfter you clean yourself (istinja’) you should sprinkle some water on your underwear, so that if you notice any moisture after that, you can tell yourself that it is the water that you sprinkled in your underwear.\nIbn Majah (464) narrated that Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did wudu’ then sprinkled water on his private part. Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is recommended to sprinkle water on the private parts and trousers, in order to dispel intrusive thoughts.\nHanbal said: I asked Ahmad: I do wudu’ after I cleanse myself, and I feel that I have invalidated my wudu’. He said: If you want to do wudu’, then in order to put your mind at rest, take a handful of water and sprinkle it over your private part, and do not pay attention to it [the intrusive thought], then it will go away, in sha Allah.""(Al-Mughni\xa01/115).\nIt says in al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (4/125): The Hanafis, Shafa‘is and Hanbalis stated that when a person has finished cleaning himself with water (istinja’) it is recommended for him to sprinkle his private part or his trousers with some water, so as to ward off intrusive thoughts, so that if he develops any doubts he will interpret that wetness as being from the sprinkling of that water, unless he is certain otherwise. End quote.\nWhat appears to us to be the case from your questions is that you are affected by intrusive thoughts (waswas); may Allah Most Generous heal you of it by His grace. So distract yourself from these intrusive thoughts as much as you can, and seek refuge with Allah from them. We advise you to consult a specialist doctor, for these intrusive thoughts are a sickness, like any other sickness. So if you combine medicinal treatment with the spiritual treatment of seeking refuge with Allah and ruqyah, and behavioural therapy with a therapist who understands that, that will be good for you, and I hope that you will recover from it, in sha Allah.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/272976/istinja-water-entering-the-urethra-then-coming-out-again
278724,"In October 2016, it was the time of the date harvest and sale of the harvest by the farmers to the date dealers at competitive prices. Praise be to Allah, I bought ten tons of top-quality dates at the seasonal price, which is 5.5 dinars. But when I wanted to receive the quantity referred to above, the seller started to delay delivery, until finally he admitted that he did not possess this quantity of dates and he did not have the money to buy that quantity and quality of dates from the market. He wants to buy it back from me on credit, and without meeting the condition of exchange on the spot. Praise be to Allah and by the grace of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, I did not agree to sell it back to him because I had not received it, and I insisted that he should deliver what I had ordered from him. But because a long time had passed, and after the end of Ramadan, this product became very scarce in the market, and most likely this seller who has been delaying delivery, even if he has the money now, will not be able to deliver my order to me, because the price has gone up and is now 11 dinars, and there is no one who can give you this large quantity even at this price. It is clear that this seller, who has been delaying delivery of my order, and after checking the market, will never be able to deliver my order with the same specifications and quantity until October of this year, after waiting for the new harvest. Please note that the price of a kilogram of dates will drop from 11 dinars to the regular harvest season price, which is 5.5 dinars, and I will lose the profit I could have made, which is 3.5-4.5 dinars, after deducting transportation and shipping costs. My question is: I do not know if I can sell to him without the exchange taking place on the spot. It seems that it is not permissible, on the grounds that dates are one of the types of food for which it is stipulated that the exchange should take place on the spot and it should be sold to a different merchant. Or should I ask him to compensate me for the profit I could have made, were it not for his clear delay in delivering my product for ten months and preventing me from benefiting from my cash by doing business with it, since it caused me to miss out on more than one opportunity by delaying delivery of the dates I could have sold?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt is permissible to sell these dates back to the seller before receiving them, according to the more correct view. This comes under the heading of selling what is to be delivered [in a salam transaction, when payment has been made in advance] before receiving it. So it is permissible to sell it back to the seller, because selling a debt to the one who owes it is permissible. But that is subject to certain conditions, one of which is that you should sell it to him at today’s price, meaning the price on the day of the sale, or less, but not more. Another condition is that if you sell it to him for cash, then it is permissible for him to pay immediately or sometime in the future. But if you sell it to him in return for wheat and the like, it is forbidden to delay payment, and the exchange must be made on the spot. Also, it is not permissible for you to sell it to him in return for dates to be delivered sometime in the future with an additional amount, because when selling dates for dates it is stipulated that they should be of equal amounts and the exchange should take place on the spot.\nThis is the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah and Ibn al-Qayyim. It is also the view of Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him), and was narrated in one report from Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If someone were to say: Is it permissible to sell something that was to be delivered before having received it [salam transaction]? The answer is: Yes, it is permissible to sell it back to the one who was supposed to deliver it. According to Shaykh al-Islam, it is permissible to sell it even to a third party, but there are some reservations about that, because in reality, if you sell it to a third party, he may not be able to receive it. Moreover, if you sell it to a third party for something that may be sold for payment later, this means that he is selling something that he has not yet received.\nThe evidence for the permissibility of selling it to a third party is not clear, and Shaykh al-Islam regards it as permissible to sell a debt to a third party, but that is subject to the condition that he has the ability to receive it.\nBut if he sells it back to the person who sold it to him [in a salam transaction] and was supposed to deliver it to him later on, then there are three conditions which must be met:\n\nThe first condition:\n\nhe should not make a profit, such as selling the goods at the current price, because if he sells them for more than the current price, then he will be making a profit on something that is not in his possession and for which he is not liable. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade making a profit on something that is not in one’s possession and for which one is not liable. For example, if a person entered into a salam transaction to buy one hundred sa‘s of wheat, paying in advance for it to be delivered later, then when the time for delivery came its value was now 200 dirhams only, so he says: I will sell it back to you for 250 dirhams, that is not permissible, because he is making a profit on this wheat before it came into his possession and he became liable for it, as he did not take possession of it and did not receive it. Thus he will have made a profit on something that was not in his possession and for which he was not liable. Moreover, in the hadith of Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) it says: “There is nothing wrong with accepting a deal on the basis of the current price, so that he will not be making a profit on something that is not in his possession and for which he is not liable.”\nSo if the hundred sa‘s are worth 200 dirhams, and he sells it back to him for 150, that is permissible, because if it is permissible to sell it at the current price, then it is more appropriate to say that it is permissible to sell it back to him for a lower price.\nBecause we gave as the reason for it not being permissible to sell it for more than the current price as being so that he does not make a profit on that which did not come into his possession and for which he did not become liable, in this case he is not making a profit; rather he is incurring a loss.\nWhat is meant by the current price is that it should not be more than that; if it is less than that, that is fine.\n\nThe second condition:\n\nthe exchange should take place before parting, if he sold him something that is subject to riba an-nasi’ah, for example, selling wheat for barley, one hundred sa‘s of wheat for two hundred sa‘s of barley. This is permissible, on condition that the exchange takes place on the spot, before parting, because when selling wheat for barley, it is stipulated that the exchange should take place on the spot, before parting, because of the hadith of Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him). There is nothing wrong with accepting the deal on the basis of the current price, so long as you have not parted and there is nothing still owing between you, because it is permissible to sell dirhams for dinars or dinars for dirhams, but when selling dirhams for dinars, it is stipulated that the exchange should take place on the spot, before parting.\n\nThe third condition:\n\nthat should not be made the price for another salam transaction [payment in advance for something to be delivered later on], because if he does that, in most cases he will make a profit on that, in which case he is making a profit on something of which he did not take possession and did not become liable for. For example, when the time comes for delivery of the one hundred sa‘s of wheat, the two parties say: We will make it a payment in advance for five sheep, because payment for animals in advance is permissible, as noted above, five sheep of such and such a description, to be delivered in one year’s time. This is not permissible, because usually that is only done to make a profit, as these five sheep are equal in value to 120 sa‘s [of wheat], and because this leads to messing about with the debt, as every time his debt becomes due, he will make it a payment in advance for something else. This is a trick aimed at messing about with what is owed and increasing what the debtor owes in this way; every time the debt becomes due, he makes it a down payment for another salam transaction, and so on, until what is owed accumulates and increases.\nSo what is more likely to be the case is that selling the debt [what you are owed] is permissible, but it is subject to the three conditions mentioned above.\nAccording to our madhhab, however, selling it is not permissible at all. The evidence for that is the hadith which says that whoever pays in advance for something to be delivered later on [salam transaction] should not divert the deal to something else, as noted above.\nBut this hadith is da‘if (weak), as was noted by Ibn al-Qayyim in Tahdheeb as-Sunan.\nEven if we assume that it is sahih (sound), we should interpret it as meaning that the one who paid in advance for something to be delivered later on should not divert it to someone else, meaning to someone other than the one who paid for it in advance. In other words, he should not make it capital for a new salam transaction.\nBut if we say that the hadith is not sahih, then selling what you are owed after having paid for it in advance is permissible in principle, because of the general meaning of the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Allah has permitted trade}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:275].\nMoreover, the hadith of Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) indicates that such transactions are permissible, because there is no difference between what is owed in a salam transaction [payment in advance] and any other transaction. Whoever claims that there is a difference between what is owed in the salam transaction and other types of debts, let him explain that to us.""(Ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘\xa0 9/87).\nSecondly:\nIf the seller delivers the dates to you, it is not permissible for you to demand compensation from him for missed opportunities, or for the expected profits [that you missed out on], no matter how long he delayed it, because compensation for a delay in paying a debt is riba.\nIt says in a statement of the Islamic Fiqh Council regarding penalty clauses:\nThe Council affirms its previous statements regarding penalty clauses that were mentioned in its statement on salam transactions, no. 85 (2/9), the text of which is as follows: It is not permissible to stipulate a penalty in the event of delay in the delivery of goods for which payment was made in advance [salam translation], because it is a kind of debt, and it is not permissible to increase the debt in the event of a delay in payment. And [the Council affirms] its statement regarding selling by instalments, no. 51 (2/6), the text of which is as follows: If the purchaser (the debtor) delays payment of instalments beyond the stated term, it is not permissible to compel him to pay anything in addition to what is owed, with or without prior stipulation, because that is riba, which is prohibited.""(Qararat al-Majma‘\xa0 p. 371).\nHere it is worth noting that delaying payment is prohibited and incurs sin, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “For a rich man to delay payment of what he owes is wrongdoing.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (2400) and Muslim (1564).\nDelaying payment means taking too long to pay back what is owed, with no excuse.\nAnd the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Any delay on the part of one who can afford (to repay a debt) makes it permissible to dishonour him and punish him.” Narrated by Abu Dawud (3268), an-Nasa’i (4689) and Ibn Majah (2427); classed as hasan by al-Albani in Irwa’ al-Ghalil (1434).\nWhat is meant by it being permissible to dishonour him is that the lender may say: So and so is taking too long to pay what he owes me and is wronging me. What is meant by punishment here is detaining him, as was explained by Sufyan and others.\nConclusion:\nThere is nothing wrong with you selling back to him the dates that he owes you in return for dinars, on condition that that be at the current market price.\nAnd there is nothing wrong with delaying payment in full or in part, because when selling the dates for dinars, there is no stipulation that the exchange should take place on the spot, before parting.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/278724/conditions-of-selling-back-to-the-seller-what-has-not-yet-been-received
