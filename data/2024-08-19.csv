350573,"I have an autistic child and I always pray for his death, because I am no longer able to support him, especially since he is growing up. His father left us, and he has become strong and beats me. I tried ruqyah and took him to Islamic centres and tried to educate him. I made many vows, but Allah did not want him to be healed, so what is the ruling on my praying for his death, because I say: O Allah, heal him or take him sooner rather than later?","['Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to offer such a supplication, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade praying against oneself or one’s children.\nMuslim (3014) narrated from Jabir ibn ‘Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not pray against yourselves, do not pray against your children, and do not pray against your wealth, lest you happen to do that at a time when whatever Allah is asked for, He grants it, and your supplication is answered.”\nIf you believe that Allah, may He be exalted, will answer your supplication for this child to die, then why do you not believe that Allah will answer your supplication for him to be healed and guided, and to mend his ways?\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\nThere is a woman whose oldest son imitates his father in doing some prohibited actions, hence she hates him because of his imitation of his father in doing prohibited actions and not fearing Allah, and she prays for his death for that reason. She is asking about the ruling on praying against her son.\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) replied:\nAs for praying for her son’s death, this is wrong. It is not appropriate for anyone who sees a misguided person to pray for his death; rather what he should do is try to advise him as much as he is able. He should also ask Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, to guide him, for all things are in the hand of Allah, and people’s hearts are between two of His fingers, and He turns them however He wills. How often have people despaired of things and thought that they could never happen, then Allah, may He be exalted, made them easy to attain. So do not think it unlikely that Allah, may He be glorified, will guide your son. Pray for him to be guided, and keep on advising him, for Allah has power over all things.""(Fatawa Nur ‘ala ad-Darb\xa0 6/13-14).\nOur advice to you is to stop praying against your son, and let your supplication be for his healing and guidance, and for him to attain what is best in this world and the hereafter. Ask Allah to bless you by making him dutiful and righteous, and to ward off from you the harm he is causing.\nYou can also seek the help of one of your male mahrams, asking him to be constantly in touch with you, so that your son can be wary of him and refrain from harming you.\nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 75399 .\nWe ask Allah, the Most Generous, to heal your son and relieve your distress.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/350573/her-son-is-autistic-and-assaults-her-should-she-pray-for-his-death
195117,Is it permissible to pray wearing clothes on which there is some impurity that has dried?,"['Praise be to Allah.The importance of purity in prayer\nIn order for prayer to be valid, it is stipulated that the worshipper should avoid having any impurity on his clothing . Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And your garments purify” [Al-Muddaththir 74:4]\xa0\nProphet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said, concerning menstrual blood that gets onto a woman’s garment: “She should scratch it, then rub it with water, then wash it, then pray in it.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 227 and Musli, 291)\xa0\nAbu Dawud (650) narrated that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) said: While the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was leading his companions in prayer, he took off his shoes and placed them to his left. When the people saw that, they also took off their shoes. When the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) finished praying, he said: “What made you take off your shoes?” They said: We saw you take off your shoes, so we took off our shoes. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Jibril (peace be upon him) came to me and told me that there was some filth on them.”\xa0\nCan one pray in impure clothes?\nThere is no differentiation between dry impurity and wet impurity with regard to it being obligatory to remove it when wanting to pray. That is because of the general meaning of the texts referred to above, which indicate that it is stipulated that one’s clothing should be pure when praying. They do not differentiate between dry impurity and wet impurity.\xa0\nThe words in the hadith quoted above: “She should scratch it, then rub it with water” indicate that dry impurity should be removed, because scratching is only done in the case of something that has dried out.\xa0\nShaykh Salih Al-Fawzan (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\nIf urine has got onto a garment then dried, is it still impure? Is it obligatory to wash the wet spot? If a person touches it, does he have to wash the area that touched it?\xa0\nHe replied:\xa0\n“Impurity cannot be removed from a garment except by washing it with purifying water. It is not sufficient merely to let the impurity dry out. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said, concerning menstrual blood that got onto a woman’s garment: “She should scratch it, then rub it with water, then wash it, then pray in it.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim) So it is essential to wash the impurity from the garment before praying in it.\xa0\nIf a person touches a wet impurity, then he must wash off whatever part of his body touched it, because the impurity has been transferred to it.\xa0\nAs for dry impurity, he does not have to wash whatever part of his body that touched it, because the impurity is not transferred to him in that case.”\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/195117/can-one-pray-in-impure-clothes
512497,What is the rule on praying in places that are higher than the Ka‘bah?,"['Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with praying in places and buildings that are higher than the Ka‘bah, such as praying on the roof of al-Masjid al-Haram, or on Jabal Abu Qubays, or on the upper floors of the high-rises surrounding al-Masjid al-Haram. The jurists refer to this matter as praying in the direction of the Ka‘bah.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nOur companion said: If someone stands on [Jabal] Abu Qubays or any of the other places that are above the level of the Ka‘bah and close to it, his prayer is valid and there is no difference of opinion concerning that, because he is regarded as facing towards the qiblah.""(Al-Majmu‘\xa0\xa03/198).\nAl-Bahuti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf he prays on a mountain that is higher than the level of the Ka‘bah, such as Abu Qubays, the prayer offered facing in its direction is valid. The same applies if he digs a hole in the ground, so that he is below the level of the Ka‘bah. The prayer offered facing in its direction is valid, because of what we have noted above, which is that what matters is the direction, not the walls.""(Kashshaf al-Qina‘\xa0 1/300).\nBased on that, there is nothing wrong with praying in places that are higher than the Ka‘bah, or in an airplane, if the worshipper is facing the direction of the Ka‘bah.\nYou should understand that the one who is close to the Ka‘bah must face it precisely, and the one who is far away from it must face in its direction, as we have explained in the answer to question no. 42574 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/512497/what-is-the-rule-on-praying-in-places-that-are-higher-than-the-kabah
70363,"I have a cousin (the daughter of my maternal aunt) who died, and it seems most likely that she committed suicide. What is the ruling on one who commits suicide? What is his position before his Lord? What can her parents do to reduce her punishment?","['Praise be to Allah.The Seriousness of Suicide in Islam\nSuicide is a major sin in Islam . The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stated that the one who commits suicide will be punished with something like that with which he killed himself.\xa0\nAbu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever throws himself down from a mountain and kills himself will be in the Fire of Hell, throwing himself down therein for ever and ever. Whoever takes poison and kills himself, his poison will be in his hand and he will be sipping it in the Fire of Hell for ever and ever. Whoever kills himself with a piece of iron, that piece of iron will be in his hand and he will be stabbing himself in the stomach with it in the Fire of Hell, forever and ever.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 5442; Muslim, 109)\xa0\nIt was narrated from Thabit ibn Ad-Dahhak (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever kills himself with something in this world will be punished with it on the Day of Resurrection.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 5700 and Muslim, 110)\xa0\nIt was narrated that Jundub ibn `Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Among those who came before you there was a man who was wounded and he panicked, so he took a knife and cut his hand with it, and the blood did not stop flowing until he died. Allah said: ‘My slave hastened to bring about his demise; I have forbidden Paradise to him.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 3276; Muslim, 113.)\nCan you offer Janazah prayer for one who commits suicide?\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) refrained from offering the funeral prayer for one who had committed suicide , as a punishment to him and so as to deter others from doing what he had done. But he gave the people permission to offer the funeral prayer for him, so it is Sunnah for the people of knowledge and virtue not to offer the funeral prayer for one who has committed suicide , following the example of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).\xa0\nIt was narrated that Jabir ibn Samurah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: A man who had killed himself with a broad arrow-head was brought to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and he did not offer the funeral prayer for him. (Narrated by Muslim, 978)\xa0\nThis Hadith is evidence for those who say that the funeral prayer should not be offered for one who killed himself because of his sin. This is the view of `Umar ibn `Abd Al-`Aziz and Al-Awza`i. But Al-Hasan, An-Nakha`i, Qatadah, Malik, Abu Hanifah, Ash-Shafi`i and the majority of scholars said that the funeral prayer should be offered for him. They responded to this Hadith by pointing out that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not offer the funeral prayer for him himself so as to deter the people from doing something similar, but the Companions offered the funeral prayer for him.\xa0 (Sharh Muslim, 7/47)\nIs suicide Kufr (disbelief)?\nThis does not mean – if it is proven that your cousin did commit suicide – that you should not pray for mercy and forgiveness for her, rather you must do that because she needs that. Suicide is not Kufr that puts a person beyond the pale of Islam as some people think, rather it is a major sin that is subject to the will of Allah on the Day of Resurrection: if He wills, He will forgive it, and if He wills He will punish for it. So do not neglect to make Du`a for her and be sincere in doing so; perhaps that may be the means of Allah forgiving her. \xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/70363/suicide-in-islam
