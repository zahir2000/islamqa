225512,"What is the meaning of Ibn al-Jawzi’s words, “If you see that the hadith is contrary to reason, then know that it is fabricated”, when many hadiths are contrary to reason, such as the Prophet’s holding the neck of the jinni and the creation of camels from the jinn, and the tree which came to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and others?","['Praise be to Allah.Everything that is soundly narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is in accordance with reason and sound human nature, and it is not possible that sound reason could contradict the soundly narrated religious texts under any circumstances.\nBut sometimes the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) may say something bewildering that we cannot grasp by means of our reasoning. But the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) never said anything that is impossible according to reason and that reason cannot accept.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhat is narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is all true and the religious texts corroborate one another. It is in accordance with sound human nature and in accordance with what is instilled in humans of sound reasoning and what they know of sound aims and objectives. So the religious texts do not contradict sound reasoning, sound objectives or sound human nature, and they do not contradict other sound narrations from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Rather the one who thinks that there are contradictions is the one who believes in some un-soundly narrated hadiths, or he has understood from the text something that it does not indicate, or he believed in some idea that he thought was based on sound reasoning when in fact it was based on ignorance, or it was based on one’s inspirational understanding when in fact it is based on flawed thinking; this applies when his understanding is contrary to a soundly-narrated report from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Or he may contradict, on the basis of sound reasoning or sound understanding, a report that he thinks is narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), but in fact it is falsely attributed to him, or he may contradict a report because of a word that he thinks means one thing, but in fact it means something else.""(Al-Risalah al-‘Arshiyyah\xa0p.35).\nHe also said:\nWhatever contradicts sound reasoning is wrong. There is nothing wrong in the Quran, Sunnah and scholarly consensus, but there are some words which some people may not understand, or they understand them incorrectly. Thus the problem is with them, not with the Quran and Sunnah.""(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa\xa0 11/490).\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe Messengers (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not say anything that is impossible according to reason and definitely cannot be true according to reason; rather what is narrated from them is of two types:\ni. That which reason and sound human nature testify to be sound.\nii. That which reason on its own cannot grasp, such as matters of the unseen of which the Messengers spoke, including details about al-barzakh and the Last Day, and details of reward and punishment. What is mentioned in these reports is not something that is completely impossible according to reason, and any report whose content one may think is impossible on the basis of reason is one of two things: either it is fabricated or falsely attributed to the Messengers, or that individual’s human reasoning is corrupt, so he imagines that there is something wrong with it and thinks that his view is based on sound reasoning.""(Al-Ruh (p, 62); see also: al-Sawa‘iq al-Mursalah\xa0 3/829-830).\nBased on that, the words of Ibn al-Jawzi (may Allah have mercy on him) –\n“How good is the comment of the one who said: If you see that the hadith is contrary to reason, or contrary to some other, soundly narrated report, or contrary to the basic principles of Islam, then know that it is fabricated. (Tadrib al-Rawi, 1/327) –\nmean: one of the signs of the fabricated hadith is that it is contrary to sound reason, or to a sound report, or to a basic principle that Muslims adhere to and are agreed on.\nWhat is meant by it being contrary to sound reason is that the hadith says something that reason rejects, such as the hadith which says, “Allah created the horse and let it run and sweat, then He created Himself from its sweat.”\nAl-Suyuti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThis cannot have been fabricated by a Muslim or one of sound mind; the one who is accused of fabricating it is Muhammad ibn Shuja‘, who was a deviant.""(Tadrib al-Rawi\xa0 1/328).\nWhen a sahih hadith mentions something that human reason cannot grasp because of its shortcomings – such as some prophetic miracles, or some matters of the unseen – this is called “what reason cannot grasp,” and it is not to be called “what reason deems impossible,” because it is not contrary to reason; rather it makes reason unable to grasp it and wonder what exactly is meant. So the individual either accepts the report and admits his inability to grasp it, which is the response of the believer, or he rejects it, which is the response of the ignorant disbeliever.\nThe fact that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed the Sahabi to call the tree, so he called it and it followed him, or the fact that he held the jinni [by the throat] and throttled him until he felt the coolness of his saliva between his fingers, are signs of prophethood in which we must believe, if the report is sound. The Muslim increases in faith thereby, and the disbeliever increases in disbelief. There is nothing in rational thinking to dictate that such events should be deemed impossible or such reports should be deemed false, even though reason, on its own, is unable to grasp such things or understand them, or determine whether they happened or not, without these reports.\nAs for the hadith, “Pray in sheep folds but do not pray in camel pens, for they are created from the devils” (narrated by Ibn Majah (769); classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah),\naccording to the well-known view, it does not mean that they were created from the devils in a real sense. Rather what is meant is that eating camel meat gives a person aggressive and devilish characteristics, so the one who eats it may acquire such characteristics, because in the make-up of the camel, there is a characteristic that makes it resemble the jinn in being unfriendly and wanting to harm people. Hence the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed people to do wudu’ after eating camel meat, and he forbade praying in the camel pens.\nSee: Majmu‘ al-Fatawa by Ibn Taymiyah (20/523, 21/10) and Hashiyat Ibn ‘Abidin (1/380).\nFor more information, please see the answer the question no. 6981 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/225512/sound-reasoning-does-not-contradict-sound-proven-religious-texts
104256,"I have a brother who is fifteen years old, and I would like you to write a message to him explaining the Islamic rulings having to do with this period of his life, with regard to puberty, purification, wet dreams and other matters pertaining to men, and everything having to do with that age, because I am not sure that he understands, and I am afraid that he is praying without having purified himself properly. I also would like some advice for him, and I hope that you will pray for him, asking Allah to send him good friends. May Allah reward you with the best reward.","['Praise be to Allah.What does Islam say about adolescence?\nWe ask Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, to guide your brother and all the young Muslims, to show them the right way, open their hearts to faith, and make things easy for them.\nThe stage of adolescence is one of the most dangerous stages that a human being goes through in his entire life, as during this stage he undergoes physical, mental, emotional and sexual changes, and the devil is very keen to tempt him during this stage.\nHow to deal with adolescents in Islam\nFrom studying what specialists and educators have said about this matter, we find that they offer the following advice:\n\nTry hard to connect the young person with righteous friends, for making friends with righteous people will make him inclined towards righteousness, because friends influence a person. As the saying goes: Do not ask about a person; rather ask about his friends, for everyone follows the example of his friends.\n\nSo he should look for good friends who adhere to religious teachings, so that he can join them, worship Allah with them, attend prayers in congregation with them, and seek beneficial knowledge with them.\nWe ask Allah, may He be Exalted, to enable your brother to find righteous friends who can help and encourage him to do good.\n\nTry hard to fill his time with activities that are beneficial and useful in both religious and worldly terms, and do not leave him with free time, for that is one of the greatest causes of trouble at this stage. Sign him up for any purposeful communal activities in your area, so that he can benefit and bring benefit to others.\nHasten to arrange his marriage, if possible, for the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “O young men, whoever among you can afford it, let him get married, for it is more effective in lowering the gaze and guarding one’s chastity. And whoever cannot afford it, let him fast, for it will be a shield for him.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 5066, and Muslim, 3464)\nOffer a great deal of Du`a for him, asking Allah to bless him and guide him.\nEncourage him to do acts of worship and to keep away from everything that is prohibited, dubious or disliked.\nDo not let him use modern means of communication in improper ways; keep him away from them, except for what is essential. So, for example, do not let him use the Internet in an isolated part of the house, such as in a closed room. The way to do that is to put the computer in a shared area of the house, so that the boy cannot be alone, watching anything that he should not watch.\n\nThese were a few useful guidelines on this topic.\nFiqhi issues related to adolescence\nWith regard to religious duties that are required of the one who reaches puberty, we cannot mention them all in detail in a single answer. But we can highlight the most important of these duties, then refer the questioner to some books from which he can learn more about this matter. Hence we say:\n\nFirstly: when the young person reaches puberty, he is obliged to adhere to all the rulings of Islam, by doing what is enjoined and refraining from what is forbidden. He must pray, fast Ramadan, give Zakah if he is one of those for whom it is obligatory, and go for Hajj if he is able for it.\n\nAs prayer is not valid without purification, the one who reaches the age of accountability must learn the rulings on prayer, because Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “when you rise to [perform] prayer, wash your faces and your forearms to the elbows and wipe over your heads and wash your feet to the ankles” [Al-Ma’idah 5:6].\nIt was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The prayer of one who passes something is not accepted, until he does Wudu.” A man said: What does passing something mean, O Abu Hurayrah? He said: Breaking wind, silently or loudly. (Narrated by Al-Bukhari (135)\nIt was narrated that Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “No prayer is accepted without Wudu, and no charity is accepted from stolen war booty.” (Narrated by Muslim, 557).\nA description of how to do Wudu is given in the answer to question no.\xa011497 . The rulings on doing Ghusl in the case of Janabah is given in the answers to questions no.\xa010790 and\xa02648 .\nWith regard to things that invalidate Wudu, please see questions no.\xa014321 and\xa011591 .\nOne of the signs of puberty is the growth of coarse hair in the pubic area and armpits. One of the Sunnahs of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) concerning that is to pluck the armpit hair and shave the pubic hair. This is explained in questions no.\xa026266 ,\xa09037 and\xa01177 .\n\nSecondly: if something becomes obligatory upon an accountable person, it is obligatory for him to learn the rulings on it, because no one can follow a command unless he understands it and learns the rulings on it.\n\nAl-Qarrafi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Anwar Al-Buruq (2/148):\n“Al-Ghazali stated in Ihya’ `Ulum Ad-Din, as did Ash-Shafi`i in Ar-Risalah, that there is consensus that it is not permissible for one who is accountable to do any action until he knows the rulings of Allah concerning it. Whoever wants to engage in buying and selling must learn the Islamic rulings concerning that; whoever wants to rent or hire anything must learn what Allah, may He be Exalted, has prescribed with regard to renting and hiring; whoever wants to lend or borrow anything must learn the rulings of Allah, may He be Exalted, concerning that; whoever wants to pray must learn the rulings of Allah, may He be Exalted, with regard to that prayer; and the same applies to purification and all other words and deeds. Whoever learns and acts in accordance with what he has learned has obeyed Allah, may He be Exalted, on two counts. Whoever does not learn and does not act has disobeyed Allah on two counts. Whoever learns but does not act in accordance with what he has learned has obeyed Allah, may He be Exalted, in one way and has disobeyed Him in one way.”\xa0\nLearning about religious duties is easy for the one for whom Allah makes it easy, so let each one strive to learn and acquire beneficial knowledge and act upon it, and let him ask his Lord for guidance.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/104256/how-to-deal-with-adolescents-in-islam
78963,What is the ruling on using emojis and drawings in chat rooms [such as icons] or using some real images to explain something?,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly\nThe basic principle regarding making images of animate beings is that it is prohibited, whether they are 3D images, or hand-drawn pictures on paper, fabric, walls or otherwise. This is the view of the majority of scholars. Please see questions no. 34839 , 10668 and 39806 .\nAl-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Riyadh al-Salihin: Chapter on the prohibition of making images of animate beings on rocks, stones, cloth, coins, cushions, pillows and so on; and the prohibition on putting images on walls, ceilings, curtains, turbans, garments and so on; and the command to eliminate such images. End quote.\nBut modern scholars differed regarding photography; some prohibited it and some permitted it. The more correct view is that it is prohibited except in cases of necessity or need. See the answers to questions no. 22660 and 8954 .\nSecondly:\nIt seems that the emojis that are used in chat rooms, such as happy faces and sad faces, do not come under the rulings on images, for two reasons:\nThe first reason is because their features are not distinct; rather they are more like a symbol. In fact some of the scholars are of the view that “if the image is so small that it does not appear clearly to the viewer unless he stares at it, it is not disliked (makruh).”""(Al-Fatawa al-Hindiyyah\xa01/108).\nThe second reason is because there is something missing from the picture’s features without which life cannot be sustained, so there is no chest or stomach, and not even a head in reality. It is no more than a circle for the face, without any hair, nose or ears.\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The image is the head, so if the head is cut off, there is no image.” Narrated by al-Isma‘ili in his Mu‘jam from Ibn ‘Abbas; classed as sahih by al-Albani in al-Silsilah al-Sahihah (1921).\nThe majority of jurists are of the view that if there is cut off from the image that without which life cannot be sustained, then it does not come under the ruling on images. Ibn Qudamah said: If the head of the image is cut off, it is no longer disliked (makruh). Ibn ‘Abbas said: The image is the head, so if the head is cut off, it is no longer an image. That was also narrated from ‘Ikrimah. It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Jibril came to me and said: ‘I came to you yesterday, and nothing prevented me from entering except the fact that there were images at the door, and in the house there was a curtain on which there were images, and there was a dog in the house. So issue instructions that the head of the image at the door be cut off, so that it will look like a tree; and issue instructions that the curtain be made into two cushions that will be stepped on; and issue instructions that the dog be taken out.’” So the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did those things.\nIf there is cut off from the image that without which the naimal could not live after it is gone, such as the chest or stomach, or it is given a head that is separate from its body, then it is not subject to the prohibition, because the image is no longer there after those things are gone, so that is like cutting off its head.\nIf what is missing is something without which it could still survive, such as an eye, hand or foot, then it is an image that comes under the prohibition.\nThe same applies if there is an image of a body without a head, or a head without a body, or it is given a head but the rest of its body is the image of an inanimate object – in that case, it is not included in the prohibition, because that is not the image of an animate being.""(Al-Mughni\xa0 7/216).\nFor more details on this matter, and the views of other scholars, please see Ahkam al-Taswir fi’l-Fiqh al-Islami, p. 234-240.\nThirdly:\nYou should avoid putting real images in chat rooms, even if it is only the image of a face. That is safer and more prudent, especially since the apparent meaning of the hadith which says that the image is the head, for the head is what matters when it comes to images, whether it is connected to the body or detached from it.\nThis was the view of some of the Shafa‘i jurists [see: Ahkam al-Taswir (235)].\nShaykh Muhammad ibn Ibrahim said: Regarding half an image [the upper half], I have no doubt that it is prohibited, even though a few people were of the view that it is not haram. Perhaps it is less serious than a complete image because of this view. As for me, I have no doubt about it, because the face is what is important in any image.""(Fatawa al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibrahim\xa01/165).\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The hadith mentioned is also quoted as evidence to prove that cutting off anything other than the head of the image, such as cutting off the lower half of it and the like, is not sufficient and does not make it permissible to use it. Doing that does not remove what prevents the angels from entering, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) issued orders that the images be torn down and erased, and he stated that they prevent the angels from entering, except when the images are things that may be handled in a disrespectful manner or the head is cut off. So anyone who tries to justify keeping an image in the house other than these two mentioned here must produce evidence from the Book of Allah or the Sunnah of His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Moreover, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him} stated that if the head is cut off an image, what remains will be like a tree. This indicates that what justifies keeping it is when it no longer has the image of an animate being and now resembles an inanimate object. But if the lower part of the image is cut off and the head remains, it does not become like that because the face is still there. Furthermore, in the face there is brilliant creation and an image that is not present in the rest of the body. So it is not permissible to make an analogy with something else for one who understands what Allah and His Messenger meant. Thus it becomes clear for the seeker of truth that depicting the head of an animate being and what is next to it is included in the prohibition, because the sahih hadiths quoted above include that.""(Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baz\xa0 4/212).\nThis real image may be used in bad ways. It should also be noted that what is prohibited is drawing the image or taking a photograph of it. As for merely clicking on it or looking at it, that is not prohibited, unless it is images of women or images that promote immorality and evil.\nMay Allah enable us all to do what He loves and is pleased with.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/78963/using-icons-and-emojis-on-the-internet
145050,"There is no doubt that each individual has his own character that Allah has given to him. Although there are characteristics that are common to all human beings, people vary with regard to the way those characteristics are combined.","['Praise be to Allah.\nAllah, may He be Exalted, created His creation and caused them to vary in characteristics, nature and attitude. This is something real and visible, and these differences are common throughout the world. Even within one family differences may be seen between the children. There is great divine wisdom in that and it is indicative of Allah’s great power.\xa0\n\n\nIt cannot be denied that\xa0 a father will feel more inclined towards the child who has good characteristics, whether physical or in his attitude, or is of a nature to which people are attracted, such as if he is cheerful, easygoing and kind. The fact that a child is male does not necessarily mean that a parent will be inclined towards him; rather we find that many fathers are more attached to their daughters, and so on.\xa0\n\n\nThe father cannot be blamed for such inclinations, but it is not wise to express that in front of the children, because of the negative results that stem from that. But if he has only one child, then he may express all his feelings and no one will blame him for that.\xa0\n\n\nMany parents do not realise that showing preference to the child who is distinguished by good and attractive characteristics may be harmful to that child who is so distinguished. That may lead to making him proud and big headed, or it may lead him to become lazy or idle and rely on others to meet his needs. There is no doubt that such a child will never be of benefit to himself or to his parents or the rest of his family.\xa0\n\n\nThe family in which the parents -- especially the father -- favour one of the children over the others cause many negative consequences, such as the following:\xa0\n\n\nThe other children will be discouraged from succeeding or advancing in both religious and worldly terms\nIt may cause them to suffer psychological or physical illness.\nIt may lead to resentment against the favoured sibling, which may go as far as murder!\n\nParents who favour some of their family over others are playing a role in the break-up and destruction of that family, because that favouritism sows the seeds of enmity, resentment and destructive envy among their children. So those who are less favoured may gang up on the one who is favoured over them, and even against their parents. The one who ponders the story of Yusuf (peace be upon him) and sees what they did to him and his other brother will clearly see that what we are saying is true. Allah, may He be Exalted, has told us the reason why they did that to their brother Yusuf. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“When they said: ‘Truly, Yusuf (Joseph) and his brother (Benjamin) are dearer to our father than we, while we are a strong group. Really, our father is in a plain error.\n‘Kill Yusuf (Joseph) or cast him out to some (other) land, so that the favour of your father may be given to you alone, and after that you will be righteous folk (by intending repentance before committing the sin.)’” [Yusuf 12:8-9]\nThere is no doubt that Ya`qub (peace be upon him) was not mistreating those other sons of his; the only thing that made them do that was his feelings of love towards his son Yusuf (peace be upon him). So how about the case of brothers whose father has wronged them by giving to one of their brothers what he did not give to them?\xa0\n\nOne of the most well-known ways in which parents favour some of their children over others is with regard to gifting, which is something that is forbidden according to the laws of Allah. Among the bad effects that result from this kind of favouritism is that it causes children to be disobedient towards their parents, so that they do not all treat their parents with the same level of respect and kindness. Our Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) drew attention to that and clearly stated that favouritism in giving is wrongdoing and unfair.\xa0\n\nIt was narrated that An-Nu`man ibn Bashir (may Allah be pleased with him) said: My father took me to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: “O Messenger of Allah, bear witness that I have given such and such of my wealth to An-Nu`man.” He said: “Did you give to all your children the same as you have given to An-Nu`man?” He said: “No.” He said: “Let someone else bear witness to that for you.” Then he said: “Would you not like all your children to honour you equally?” He said: “Yes.” He said: “Then no (I will not bear witness).”\xa0\xa0(Narrated by Muslim, 3059)\xa0\nJust as Allah, may He be Exalted, has forbidden this favouritism among children in gifting, He has also forbidden something else, namely making a bequest to any one of them. He has forbidden making a bequest to an heir (one who automatically inherits according to Shari`ah). All these rulings are in the best interests of the family and lay the foundations for family unity, not division. \xa0\n\nThe father should realise that not one of his children is perfect. If he favours one of his children for some reason, if he is fair-minded he will also find that the child has some other, negative, characteristics. The opposite may also be said of those whom he does not favour: many of them may have many positive qualities. A child who is loved for the way he moves and speaks may not be able to help the family by buying groceries from the store, and he may not be good at welcoming and serving guests. Parents should pay attention to that. They should encourage the good characteristics of their children and help them to develop them, and not expect the others to be the same. Each person will be helped to do that for which he was created. One of them may love to work, another may love to seek knowledge; a third may love to deal in trade. Some of them may have characteristics that are not found in others. The wise father tries to develop that and makes them complement one another. If he praises the positive characteristics in one child, he should also praise the positive characteristics in others, so that there will be no destructive envy or resentment among them, by Allah’s leave and with His help.\xa0\n\n\nBy the same token, parents should also beware of scolding children for their mistakes and demanding that one child be like his brother so and so. Rather he should mention to him the good qualities of his relatives or neighbours of the same age, or encourage him to develop good characteristics whilst discouraging bad characteristics, without mentioning anyone [from his siblings] in particular, because comparing him with a sibling who is better than him in this case would generate enmity and resentment between them.\xa0\n\n\nIt is not fair for the father to treat the disobedient one among his children the same as he treats the one who obeys him, otherwise the obedient one will not have any advantages. He has to make it clear that the one who does good -- such as helping his mother in the house or memorising Quran -- will have a reward, whereas the one who behaves badly will be deprived of it or penalised -- according to whatever misdemeanours the children may commit. Of course, we do not mean here that he should give him a gift -- we have explained above that doing that is prohibited; rather we mean that he should praise him by saying good things, or giving him more pocket money, or he can let him play a permissible game for longer than the one who misbehaved, and so on. This is the fairness that we encourage in parents; not treating all of them -- those who behave well and those who behave badly -- in the same manner, otherwise it would be unfair to the one who is obedient.\xa0\n\nThe father has the right to withhold from the one who is stubbornly disobedient the money with which he commits sin; in fact it is obligatory for the father to do that, so that he can prevent his child from doing that which angers his Lord, may He be Exalted.\xa0\nShaykh `Abdullah Al-Jibrin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “I will not bear witness to unfairness,” meaning that if the father was more inclined towards one of them, then he may be called unfair or unjust, but it may be that doing that is permissible if the one whom he favours is righteous and the other one is an evildoer and sinner. If he tries to set him straight and fails, and the child becomes disobedient and defiant towards his parents and disobedient towards Allah, turning away from Him and from worship, and indulging in consuming intoxicants and committing evil deeds and sins, and his parents cannot set him straight --- in that case, there is nothing to stop the parents (treating their children differently). In that case it is permissible for them to overlook the issue of equality and not treat him the same as others. Rather they should be strict in dealing with him, even if they deprive him of their care or spending on him, or they penalise him in a way that will bring him back to the right path, with the help of Allah.” (Durus Ash-Shaykh Ibn Jibrin, 1/23)\xa0\n\nAnother matter we advise parents with is to direct their children’s feelings towards the one among their siblings who deserves compassion and love. For example, one of the children may have a disability, so the parents should direct their children to show compassion and love towards their sibling before themselves. In this way they will ensure that the one who has the disability will be given his share of compassion, and they will ensure that there will be no ill feeling between them and their sibling.\xa0\n\n\nNo matter what the differences in the characters and natures of the children, fairness between them in visible matters is something that is prescribed in Islam. If the father pays the marriage expenses for one of them, he should also do that for each of them who wants to get married. If he pays for the medical treatment of one of them who falls sick, he should do the same for whoever needs treatment. If he contributes to the education of one of them, he should do the same for the others too -- so long as it falls within the category of permissible education. The same may also be said with regard to maintenance and clothing. He should treat all of his children fairly with regard to this matter. But we do not say that it should be the same; rather it should be fair. What we mean by that is that he should give each of them what is sufficient for him. Indeed, some of the Salaf (pious predecessors) were of the view that it is preferred to be fair with children in the matter of kissing them!\xa0\n\nImam Al-Baghawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said, commenting on the Hadith of An-Nu`man ibn Bashir (may Allah be pleased with him) quoted above:\xa0\n“There are many lessons to be learned from this Hadith, such as: it is recommended to treat children equally in gift-giving and in all kinds of kindness, even kisses, whether they are male or female, so that there will not be anything in the heart of the less-favoured one that will keep him from honouring the parents.” (Sharh As-Sunnah, 8/297)\nIt was narrated that Ibrahim An-Nakha`i (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “They regarded it as recommended for a man to treat his children equally even with regard to kissing.” (Musannaf Ibn Abu Shaybah, 11/221)\xa0\nSimilarly, he should not favour any child over another. This does not mean that he should have the same feelings towards all of them, because that is something that the father does not have control over. Rather he has control over being fair towards them in outward matters, as is the case with one who has more than one wife: he is not forbidden to love one of his wives more than another, but at the same time he is enjoined to treat them fairly with regard to that which he has control over, namely being fair with regard to outward matters such as maintenance, spending the night with them, and clothing. \xa0\nWe ask Allah to enable you to do that which pleases Him, and to help you to achieve fairness among your children.\xa0\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 10016 , 279342 , 215167 , 20064 , and 162787 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/145050/is-favouritism-among-ones-children-allowed-in-islam
