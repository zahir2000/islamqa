267450,"Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {The sun cannot catch up with the moon, nor can the night outstrip the day. Each floats in its own orbit} [Ya-Sin 36:40]. I read that someone on the Internet says that this is a contradiction – I ask Allah for forgiveness – because in the case of a solar eclipse, the sun has caught up with the moon and the night has come during the day. I know that this is not true, so I hope that you can give me a response to put a stop to this specious argument.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nYou should understand that Allah, may He be exalted, is the One Who created and fashioned in due proportion, and made all things according to a measure and guided them, and everything in the universe testifies to the greatness and might of Allah, may He be exalted.\nHe has told us about His creation, and the Maker knows best about what He has made, so Allah, may He be exalted, knows best about His creation: {How could He Who created not know His own creation, when He is the Knower of subtleties, the All-Aware?} [Al-Mulk 67:14].\nMoreover, you should understand that the [pagan] Arabs heard these verses, and they were the keenest of people to find fault with the Qur’an. Solar and lunar eclipses occurred at the time of the [pagan] Arabs, yet there is no report to indicate that any of them objected to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) by saying that “the sun had caught up with the moon, so how could the Qur’an claim that the sun cannot catch up with the moon?”\nIndeed, not a single one of them presented this argument, which indicates that it is not as this person said; rather this stems from a misunderstanding of the verses and a misunderstanding of natural phenomena too.\nSecondly:\nWhat the verse means is that the sun cannot rise at night, because the night is the time for the moon to rise, and the moon cannot rise during the day, because that is the time for the sun to rise.\nImam Ibn Jarir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIt is not appropriate for the sun to catch up with the moon, because that would lead to the light of the sun covering the light of the moon, so it would be day all the time, with no night. {Nor can the night outstrip the day} [Ya-Sin 36:40]. Here Allah, may He be exalted is saying that the night should not overwhelm the day, because that would lead to its darkness cancelling out the light of day, so it would be night all the time. Al-Tabari (19/438).\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: And He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{It is He Who made the sun a radiant light and the moon a reflected light, and ordained its phases, so that you may know how to count the years and measure time}\xa0[Yunus 10:5]\n{We have made the night and the day as two [of Our] signs. We obscured the sign of the night with darkness and gave light to the sign of the day, so that you might seek the bounty of your Lord and know the number of the years and the reckoning of time. And We have explained all things in detail}\xa0[al-Isra’ 17:12].\nAllah has given the sun its own radiant light and has given the moon its own reflected light, and He has made a difference between the orbits of both of them. Hence the sun rises every day and sets at the end of the day, and its light is always the same, but the point of its rising and setting varies between the summer and the winter, as a result of which days become longer and nights become shorter, then nights become longer and days become shorter. And He has caused it to be dominant during the day, so it is a diurnal heavenly body.\nAs for the moon, He has ordained phases for it. On the first night of the month, it appears small, with little light, then its light increases on the second night and it rises higher, and the higher it rises the more light it has, even though its light is a reflection of the sun’s light, until its light becomes complete on the fourteenth night. Then it starts to decrease in size until the end of the month, until it becomes like an old date-stalk, dried-up and curved.\nRegarding the words, {The sun cannot catch up with the moon}, Mujahid said: Each of them has a limit or orbit that it cannot go beyond, and it cannot fall short of that. When one is dominant, the other disappears, and when the dominant one disappears, the other one dominates. Tafsir Ibn Kathir (6/578).\nAl-Tahir Ibn ‘Ashur (may Allah have mercy on him) said: What is meant is an affirmation that they cannot collide, so the sun cannot collide with the moon, and vice versa.\nHe said: What is meant is that the sun cannot collide with the moon, contrary to the way they appear, for they seem to be close. Al-Tahrir wa’l-Tanwir (23/24).\nWhatever meaning we choose from the above, there is no contradiction between this verse and the occurrence of solar and lunar eclipses, because that is not the kind of catching up that is referred to in this verse.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/267450/commentary-on-the-verse-the-sun-cannot-catch-up-with-the-moon-ya-sin-3640-and-its-connection-to-solar-and-lunar-eclipses
100449,"I heard that the one who swears a false oath (Yameen Al-Ghamus) will be immersed in Hell, and that there is no expiation for it. Does this mean that there can be no repentance from this sin?","['Praise be to Allah.What is Al-Yamin Al-Ghamus?\nAl-Yamin Al-Ghamus refers to a false and evil oath in which a person unlawfully consumes the property of another. It is called Ghamus (lit. immersing) because it immerses the one who does that in sin and then in Hell. (Ibn Al-Athir in An-Nihayah, 3/724)\xa0\nSecondly:\xa0\nIt says in Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah (35/41):\xa0\n“The jurists differed concerning the necessity of expiation in the case of a false oath . There are two points of view:\xa0\n\nIt is not obligatory to offer expiation for a false oath . This is the view of the majority of jurists: the Hanafis, Malikis and Hanbalis.\xa0\nIt is obligatory to offer expiation for a false oath . This is the view of the Shafi`is. \xa0\n\nEach group offered evidence to support its view.” (See: Bada’i` Al-Sana’i, 3/3; Al-Taj wAl-Iklil, 3/266; and Kashf Al-Qina`, 6/235)\nIt says in Fatawa Al-Lajnah Al-Da’imah (23/133):\xa0\n“Al-Yamin Al-Ghamus is a major sin, for which no expiation is sufficient because it is such a grave sin. No expiation is required for it according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions; rather what is required is repentance and prayers for forgiveness.”\xa0\nWhether one says that expiation is required or not, the expiation does not expiate the sin of a false oath. Rather it is essential to repent sincerely.\xa0\nHence Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in Majmu` Al-Fatawa (34/139), after mentioning the difference of scholarly opinion concerning expiation for a false oath:\xa0\n“But they agreed that the sin is not erased merely by offering expiation.”\nDoes repentance expiate false oaths?\nA false oath, like other sins, may be expiated by sincere repentance . There is no sin for which repentance cannot be accepted, for Allah has opened the door of repentance to every sinner , and Allah accepts the repentance of the one who repents.\xa0\nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Say: O My slaves who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allah, verily, Allah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” [Az-Zumar 39:53]\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \xa0\n“This verse is a call to all sinners, disbelievers and others, to repent and turn to Allah. It tells us that Allah forgives all sins for the one who repents from them and turns away from them, no matter what they are, no matter how many they are, even if they are like the foam of the sea. There are many verses on this topic.”\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/100449/does-repentance-expiate-false-oaths
98479,"I want to know about buying gold from an auction for a very cheap price, because some people leave it with the bank as collateral, and when the time [for paying their debt] comes, the bank sells it for much less than its real price. Is buying this gold permissible for me?","['Praise be to Allah.It is permissible to buy gold from an auction subject to two conditions:\n1.\xa0That the purchase is hand-to-hand, which includes certified cheques, which means that the money is moved from the buyer’s account and is deposited in the seller’s account immediately. Please see question no. 2711 .\nThe Islamic Fiqh Council belonging to the Muslim World League issued a statement in its eleventh session in which they said: After studying and discussing the matter, the council unanimously determined the following:\nFirstly: the receipt of the [certified] cheque may be regarded as an exchange on the spot, if certain conditions are met when money is to be transferred between banks.\nSecondly: recording it in the bank’s records comes under the ruling on exchange on the spot for one who wants to exchange one currency for another, whether this exchange is in return for currency that a person gives to the bank, or when the money is already deposited in the bank. End quote.\n2.\xa0The bank’s sale of the collateral should be permissible according to Islamic rulings. What that means is it is only permissible to sell the collateral if the time for payment of the debt has come and the debtor refuses to pay it. So if the borrower gave the lender (the bank) permission to sell the collateral, the matter is clear. If he did not give permission, the authorities or judge should force him to sell, and if he does not do that, then the authorities should sell the collateral and pay the lender what is due to him. In that case, the authorities may appoint a proxy to handle the sale, whether the proxy is the lender or someone else.\nIt says in Zad al-Mustaqni‘: When the debt becomes due and the borrower refuses to pay, if the borrower gave permission to the lender to sell (the collateral), he should sell it and pay the debt, otherwise the authorities should force him to pay up or sell the collateral. If he does not do that, the authorities should sell the collateral and pay off the debt. End quote.\nIf the system in that country gives permission to the bank to sell collateral when the debt becomes due and the borrower does not pay it, then this is like permission from the authorities or the judge.\nBut that is subject to the condition that whoever sells the collateral, whether it is the bank or someone appointed by the judge, should sell it at the regular price, not for less than that.\nIt says in Mughni al-Muhtaj (3/71): The person with whom the collateral is kept should not sell it except for the regular price in the local currency, with the exchange taking place on the spot; he is like a proxy, so he should not sell it for a lower price. If he fails to pay attention to any of these conditions, the sale is not valid, but it does not matter if the price is a little lower than the regular price, in a manner that people usually agree on through bargaining, because people usually tolerate that.\nThus you will realise that it is not permissible for the bank to sell the gold for much less than its regular price, and it is not permissible to buy it from the bank [for such a low price], because this transaction is not valid, as explained above, and because it is consuming the borrower’s wealth unlawfully.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/98479/if-the-bank-sells-gold-by-auction-that-it-is-keeping-as-collateral-is-it-permissible-to-buy-it
149276,Is it permissible for me to recite Du`as (supplications) from the book Abwab Al-Faraj by Muhammad `Alawi Al-Hasani Al-Maliki? Are there any Du`as narrated from the Messenger for relief from worry and stress?,"['Praise be to Allah.Reciting Du`a from the book of Abwab Al-Faraj\nWe have not read the book Abwab Al-Faraj in its entirety, but we have come across some paragraphs of it which contained innovated prayers such as Salat Al-fatih ”, “As-Salah An-Nariyyah ”, “As-Salah Al-Munjiyah” and others which contain odd phrases and blameworthy exaggeration.\xa0\nDu`a for anxiety and stress\nWith regard to Du`as for relief from worry and stress , they include:\xa0\n\nThat which was narrated by Ahmad (3528) from `Abdullah ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “No person suffers any anxiety or grief, and says: `Allahumma inni `abduka wa ibn `abdika wa ibn amatika, nasiyati bi yadika, madin fiyya hukmuka, `adlun fiyya qada’uka, as’aluka bi kulli ismin huwa laka sammayta bihi nafsaka aw anzaltahu fi kitabika aw `allamtahu ahadan min khalqika aw ista’tharta bihi fi `ilm il-ghaybi `andak an taj`ala Al-Qur’ana rabi` qalbi wa nur sadri wa jala’a huzni wa dhahaba hammi (O Allah, I am Your slave, son of Your slave, son of Your female slave, my forelock is in Your hand, Your command over me is forever executed and Your decree over me is just. I ask You by every Name belonging to You which You named Yourself with, or revealed in Your Book, or You taught to any of Your creation, or You have preserved in the knowledge of the unseen with You, that You make the Quran the life of my heart and the light of my breast, and a departure for my sorrow and a release for my anxiety)` but Allah will take away his sorrow and grief, and give him in their stead joy.” It was said: O Messenger of Allah, should we not learn them (these words)? He (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: Yes indeed; whoever hears them should learn them.”\xa0 (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in As-Silsilah As-Sahihah, 199)\nThat which was narrated by Abu Dawud (5090) and Ahmad (27898) from Abu Bakrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The Du`a of the person who is in distress is : `Allahumma rahmataka arju fa la takilni ila nafsi tarfat `ayn wa aslih li sha’ni kullahu la ilaha illa anta (O Allah, for Your mercy I hope, so do not leave me in charge of my affairs even for the blink of an eye; rectify all my affairs. There is no god worthy of worship except You)`” (Classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud)\xa0\nThat which was narrated by Muslim (2730) from Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to say, when he felt distressed:\n\n“La ilaha ill-Allah Al-`Athim ul-Halim, La ilaha ill-Allah Rabb il-`arsh il-`athim, La ilaha ill-Allah Rabb is-samawati wa Rabb il-ard wa Rabb il-`arsh il-karim (there is no god worthy of worship except Allah, the All-Mighty, the Forbearing; there is no god worthy of worship except Allah, the Lord of the Mighty Throne; there is no god worthy of worship except Allah, Lord of the heavens, Lord of the earth and Lord of the noble Throne).”\xa0\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Sharh Muslim:\xa0\n“This is a great Hadith that one should pay attention to and recite a great deal at times of distress and calamity. At-Tabari said: The early generations used to offer this supplication and they called it Du`a Al-karb (the supplication of distress ). If it is said that this is dhikr (remembrance of Allah) and there is no supplication in it, that may be answered in two well-known points: (i) that the supplication may begin with this dhikr, then one may offer supplication as one wishes; (ii) the response of Sufyan ibn `Uyaynah who said: Do you not know the words of Allah, may He be Exalted [stated in a Qudsi Hadith]: “Whoever is distracted by remembrance of Me from asking of Me, I shall give him the best of that which I give to those who ask .” The poet said: If a man praises you, then that is enough and there is no need for him for state that he needs help [because his praise of you is a signal that he needs help.”\xa0\nFor more, you can read this booklet “Dealing with Worries.”\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/149276/dua-for-relief-from-anxiety-and-stress
