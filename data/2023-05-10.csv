108579,What is the true belief? I would also like to know about some false beliefs.,"[""Praise be to Allah.1.It is known on the basis of shar‘i evidence from the Qur’an and Sunnah that deeds and actions can only be valid and accepted by Allah if they stem from sound belief. If the belief is not correct, then the actions and words that stem from it are invalid, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And whoever denies the faith - his work has become worthless, and he, in the Hereafter, will be among the losers}[al-Ma’idah 5:5]\n{And it was already revealed to you and to those before you that if you should associate [anything] with Allah, your deeds would surely become worthless}[az-Zumar 39:65].\nAnd there are many similar verses.\n2.The Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) clearly indicate that sound belief may be summed up as: believing in Allah, His angels, His Books, His Messengers, the Last Day, and the divine decree, both good and bad. These six matters form the basis of sound belief with which the Book of Allah was sent down and with which Allah sent His Messenger Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nThere is a great deal of evidence for these six fundamentals in the Qur’an and Sunnah, such as the verses in which Allah, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Righteousness is not that you turn your faces toward the east or the west, but [true] righteousness is [in] one who believes in Allah , the Last Day, the angels, the Book, and the prophets …}[al-Baqarah 2:177]\n{The Messenger has believed in what was revealed to him from his Lord, and [so have] the believers. All of them have believed in Allah and His angels and His books and His messengers, [saying], “We make no distinction between any of His messengers”}[al-Baqarah 2:285]\n{O you who have believed, believe in Allah and His Messenger and the Book that He sent down upon His Messenger and the Scripture which He sent down before. And whoever disbelieves in Allah, His angels, His books, His messengers, and the Last Day has certainly gone far astray}[an-Nisa’ 4:136].\nThere are also many sahih hadiths which point to these fundamentals, such as the famous sahih hadith which was narrated by Muslim in his Sahih from Amir al-Mu’minin ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which Jibril (peace be upon him) asked the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) about faith, and he said to him: “Faith is to believe in Allah, His angels, His Books, His Messengers, and the Last Day, and to believe in the divine decree, both good and bad…” This hadith was also narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim from Abu Hurayrah.\nFrom these six fundamentals stem everything that the Muslim must believe in with regard to Allah, may He be glorified, and with regard to the resurrection, and other matters of the unseen.\n3.Belief in Allah, may He be glorified: this includes believing that He is the [only] true God Who is deserving of worship, to the exclusion of all others, because He is the Creator of people, the One Who cares for them, the One Who provides for them, the One Who has knowledge of all that that do, both in secret and openly, the One Who is able to reward those who obey Him and punish those who disobey Him. It is for this purpose of worshipping Him that Allah created the two races [of humankind and the jinn] and commanded them [to worship Him alone].\nThe true meaning of this worship is to single out Allah, may He be glorified, alone for all acts of worship that people do, such as calling upon Him in supplication, fear, hope, prayer, fasting, offering sacrifices, making vows and other types of worship, which are to be done for Him alone, with humility, seeking His pleasure and fearing His wrath, with perfect love for Him, humbling themselves before His might.\nAnother part of believing in Allah is believing in everything that He has enjoined upon His slaves and made obligatory for them, such as the five pillars of Islam – which are: testifying that there is no god worthy of worship except Allah, and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah; establishing prayer; giving zakah; fasting Ramadan; and going on pilgrimage to the Sacred House of Allah (Hajj), for the one who is able to do that – and other obligatory deeds which are mentioned in Islamic teachings.\nThe greatest and most important of these pillars is testifying that there is no god worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. Testifying that there is no god worthy of worship except Allah dictates that one should devote worship sincerely to Allah alone, and refrain from worshipping anyone or anything besides Him. This is the meaning of La ilaha illa Allah (there is no god worthy of worship except Allah), for what it means is that there is none that is deserving of worship except Allah, so everything that is worshipped besides Allah, whether a human, an angel, a jinni or anything else, is worshipped on the basis of falsehood, and the only one Who is worshipped on the basis of truth is Allah alone, as He, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{That is because Allah is the Truth, and that which they call upon other than Him is falsehood}[al-Hajj 22:62].\nAnother part of believing in Allah is believing in His beautiful names and sublime attributes, as narrated in His Book and in sound reports from His Messenger, without distorting or denying the meaning, without discussing how they are, and without likening Him to His creation. Rather they must be taken as they are, without discussing how, whilst believing in what is indicated by the sublime attributes that are ascribed to Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. We must affirm these attributes in the manner that is befitting to Him, without likening Him to His creation in any of His attributes, as Allah, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the Hearing, the Seeing}[ash-Shura 42:11].\n4.Believing in the angels, which includes believing in them in general terms and in specific terms. So the Muslim believes that Allah has angels whom He created to obey Him, and He has described them as honoured slaves who do not speak until He has spoken and they carry out His commands:\n{He knows what is [presently] before them and what will be after them, and they cannot intercede except on behalf of one whom He approves. And they are filled with reverent awe of Him}[al-Anbiya’ 21:28].\nThey are of many kinds. Some of them are appointed to be the bearers of the Throne; some of them are the keepers of Paradise and Hell; some of them are appointed to keep a record of people’s deeds.\nAnd we believe in specific terms in those whom Allah and His Messenger have mentioned by name, such as Jibril, Mika’il, Malik the keeper of Hell, and Israfil who is appointed to blow the Trumpet [on the Day of Resurrection]; he is mentioned in sound hadiths. It is proven in as-Sahih from ‘A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The angels were created from light, the jinn were created from smokeless fire, and Adam was created from what has been described to you.” Narrated by Muslim in his Sahih.\n5.Belief in the Books: it is obligatory to believe in general terms that Allah, may He be glorified, sent down Books to His Prophets and Messengers to explain the truth and call people to it, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{We have already sent Our messengers with clear evidences and sent down with them the Scripture and the balance that the people may maintain [their affairs] in justice}[al-Hadid 57:25].\nWe believe in specific terms in those which Allah has mentioned by name, such as the Tawrat (Torah), the Injil (Gospel), the Zabur (Psalms) and the Qur’an.\nThe Holy Qur’an is the best of them and the last of them, and it supersedes them and confirms them. It is the one which all people are obliged to follow and refer to for judgement, along with what is soundly narrated from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) of the Sunnah, because Allah, may He be glorified, sent His Messenger Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) as a messenger to both races [humankind and the jinn], and He sent down to him this Qur’an so that he might judge between them according to it. He has made it a healing for what is in their hearts, and an explanation for all things, guidance and mercy for the believers, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And this [Qur'an] is a Book We have revealed [which is] blessed, so follow it and fear Allah that you may receive mercy}[al-An‘am 6:155].\n6.Belief in the Messengers: it is obligatory to believe in the Messengers in general terms and in specific terms. Hence we believe that Allah, may He be exalted, sent to His slaves Messengers from among them, as bringers of glad tidings and warners, and as callers to the truth. Whoever responds to their call will attain bliss, and whoever goes against them will incur loss and regret. The last and best of the Messengers is our Prophet Muhammad ibn ‘Abdillah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), as Allah, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And We certainly sent into every nation a messenger, [saying], “Worship Allah and shun false gods”}[an-Nahl 16:36].\nWith regard to those whom Allah has mentioned by name, or their names are soundly narrated from the Messenger of Allah, we believe in them in specific terms, such as Nuh, Hud, Salih, Ibrahim and others – blessings and peace of Allah be upon them and upon our Prophet.\n7.Belief in the Last Day. Belief in the Last Day includes believing in everything that Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) have told us about what will happen after death, such as the trial and punishment or bliss in the grave, and what will happen on the Day of Resurrection of terrors, hardships, the sirat, the balance, the reckoning, requital, and the distribution of the records among the people, when some will receive their record in their right hands and others will receive their records in their left hands or behind their backs. That also includes believing in the cistern of our Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to which people will come, and believing in Paradise and Hell, and believing that the believers will see their Lord, may He be glorified, and He will speak to them, and other things that are mentioned in the Qur’an and soundly narrated in the sahih Sunnah from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). We must believe in all of that and affirm it in the manner in which Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) have explained it.\n8.Belief in the divine decree. Believing in the divine decree includes believing in four things: Allah’s knowledge, His writing all things in al-Lawh al-Mahfuz, creation and the divine will. For more details on that, please see the answers to questions 34732 , 49004 and 20806 .\n9.Believing in Allah also includes believing that faith consists of words and deeds, and it increases by doing righteous deeds and decreases by committing sins; and that it is not permissible to deem any Muslim to be a disbeliever for committing any sin that is less than shirk or disbelief, such as zina, theft, consuming riba, consuming intoxicants, defiantly disobeying parents, and other major sins, so long as he does not regard those things as permissible, because Allah says:\n{Indeed, Allah does not forgive association with Him, but He forgives what is less than that for whom He wills}[an-Nisa’ 4:48].\nAnd it is proven in the mutawatir hadiths narrated from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that Allah will bring forth from the Fire anyone who has in his heart faith the size of a mustard seed.\n10.Part of believing in Allah is loving for the sake of Allah, hating for the sake of Allah, taking some people as allies for the sake of Allah, and taking others as enemies for the sake of Allah. So the believer loves the believers and regards them as allies, and he hates the disbelievers and regards them as enemies.\nForemost among the believers of this ummah are the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Ahl as-Sunnah wa’l-Jama‘ah love them and regard them as allies, and they believe that they are the best of people after the Prophets, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The best of people are my generation, then those who come after them, then those who come after them.” Sahih – agreed upon.\nThey believe that the best of them are: Abu Bakr as-Siddiq, then ‘Umar al-Faruq, then ‘Uthman Dhu’n-Nurayn, then ‘Ali al-Murtada (may Allah be pleased with them all). After them come the rest of the ten who were given the glad tidings of Paradise, then the rest of the Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them all). They refrain from discussing the disputes that arose among the Sahabah, and they believe that in that case each of them was striving to reach the right conclusion and make the right decision; whoever got it right will have two rewards and whoever got it wrong will have one reward. They love the family members of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) who believed in him, and they regard them as allies. They regard as allies the wives of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon them), the Mothers of the Believers, and they pray that Allah be pleased with all of them.\nThey reject the way of the Rafidis who hate and revile the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and exaggerate about the members of the Prophet’s family (Ahl al-Bayt), raising them to a status higher than that which Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, bestowed upon them. They also reject the way of the Nasibis who revile Ahl al-Bayt in words or deeds.\n11.Everything that we have mentioned above is the sound ‘aqidah (belief or creed) with which Allah sent His Messenger Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). It is the creed of the saved group, Ahl as-Sunnah wa’l-Jama‘ah, concerning which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “A group of my ummah will continue to adhere to the path of truth and they and they will continue to prevail, and they will not be harmed by those who forsake them, until the decree of Allah comes to pass.” And he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The Jews split into seventy-one groups, and the Christians split into seventy-two groups. This ummah will split into seventy-three groups, all of whom will be in the Fire except one.” The Sahabah said: Who are they, O Messenger of Allah? He said: “Those who follow that which I and my companions follow.” This is the ‘aqidah and sound creed to which we must adhere and remain steadfast therein, and we must beware of anything that goes against it.\n12.As for those who deviate from this ‘aqidah and follow the opposite, they are of many kinds. Among them are those who worship idols, images, angels, the awliya’ (“saints”; close friends of Allah), the jinn, trees, rocks and so on. Those people have not responded to the call of the Messengers; rather they have gone against them and stubbornly rejected them, as Quraysh and other Arabs did with our Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him); they used to ask their objects of worship to meet their needs, heal the sick and grant them victory over their enemies, and they used to offer sacrifices to them and make vows to them. When the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) rebuked them for that, and instructed them to devote worship sincerely to Allah alone, they found that odd and rejected it, and they said:\n{“Has he made the gods [only] one God? Indeed, this is a curious thing”}[Sad 38:5].\nThen circumstances changed, and ignorance prevailed over most people until the majority have gone back to the religion of the Jahiliyyah, exaggerating about the Prophets and the awliya’, calling upon them, seeking their help and other kinds of shirk (associating others with Allah). They do not understand the true meaning of La ilaha illa Allah (there is no god worthy of worship except Allah) as even the disbelievers among the Arabs understood it. This shirk continued to spread among the people until the present day, because of the prevalence of ignorance, and because we are so far from the era of prophethood.\n13.One of the kinds of creeds based on disbelief that are opposed to sound ‘aqidah and opposed to the message of the Messengers (blessings and peace of Allah be upon them) is what the atheists believe in nowadays, namely the followers of Marx, Lenin and others who promote atheism and disbelief, regardless of whether they call that socialism or communism or Baathism or any other names. One of the basic principles of these atheists is that there is no God and life is purely materialistic. Other basic principles of theirs include denial of the resurrection, denial of paradise and hell, and disbelief in all religions. Anyone who examines and studies their books will realise that for sure. Undoubtedly this creed is opposed to all the divinely-revealed religions and will lead its followers to the worst consequences in this world and the hereafter.\n14.Another kind of creed that is opposed to the truth is what some esoterics (batinis) and some Sufis believe in, that some of those whom they call awliya’ (“saints” or “holy men”) share control with Allah, directing the affairs of the universe. They call them by titles such as aqtab, awtad, aghwath and other names that they have fabricated for their gods. This is one of the most reprehensible types of associating others with Allah in His Lordship, and it is worse than the shirk of the Arabian Jahiliyyah, because the disbelieving Arabs did not associate others with Allah in His Lordship; rather they associated others with Him in their worship, and they did that at times of ease, but at times of hardship, they devoted their worship sincerely to Allah alone, as Allah, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{\xa0And when they board a ship, they supplicate Allah , sincere to Him in religion. But when He delivers them to the land, at once they associate others with Him}[al-‘Ankabut 29:65].\nWith regard to divine Lordship, they acknowledged that it belongs to Allah alone, as He, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And if you asked them who created them, they would surely say, “Allah”}[az-Zukhruf 43:87]\n{Say, “Who provides for you from the heaven and the earth? Or who controls hearing and sight and who brings the living out of the dead and brings the dead out of the living and who arranges [every] matter?” They will say, “Allah,” so say, “Then will you not fear Him?”}[Yunus 10:31].\nAnd there are many similar verses.\n15.Among the creeds that are opposed to sound Islamic ‘aqidah regarding the divine names and attributes are the beliefs of the innovators such as the Jahamis, Mu‘tazilah and others who followed their way in denying the attributes of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, and denying His attributes of perfection, and they ascribed to Him, may He be glorified and exalted, attributes of non-existent beings, inanimate beings and impossible beings – exalted be Allah far above what they say.\nThat also includes those who deny some of the divine attributes and affirm others, such as the Ash‘aris, who should have applied the same argument as they applied to the attributes that they affirmed to the attributes that they denied and interpreted in a manner other than what was indicated by the apparent meaning. Thus they went against both the textual evidence and the rational evidence, and contradicted themselves.\nSummarised from the essay al-‘Aqidah as-Sahihah wa ma yudaduha by Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him).\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/108579/a-brief-look-at-issues-of-sound-aqidah-belief-creed-for-muslims-and-the-false-beliefs-that-are-their-opposites
217461,"I saw in one of your answers that joking is permissible if it is true. Can you explain that by giving some examples? Is it permissible to joke by saying mocking words, such as when through his tone of voice, a person indicates that what he means is something other than what he is saying? Is it permissible to tell jokes that are based on imaginary situations?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt is well known and established among all Muslims that lying is haram in all cases; in fact, the reprehensible nature of telling lies and the prohibition thereon is something on which all religions agree, and the aversion to lying is something that is deeply rooted in sound human nature, no matter what religion a person follows.\nWhat is required of the Muslim is to be truthful in his speech in all situations.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{O you who have believed, fear Allah and be with those who are true}\xa0[at-Tawbah 9:119].\nIt was narrated from ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud (may Allah be pleased with him) from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), who said: “Truthfulness leads to righteousness, and righteousness leads to Paradise. A man may continue to speak the truth until he is recorded with Allah as a speaker of truth. Lying leads to wickedness and wickedness leads to Hell. A man may continue to tell lies until he is recorded with Allah as a liar.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (6094) and Muslim (2607).\nIt was narrated from ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There are four characteristics, whoever has them all is a pure hypocrite, and whoever has one of them has one of the characteristics of hypocrisy, until he gives it up: when he is entrusted with something, he betrays that trust; when he speaks, he lies; when he makes a covenant, he breaks it; and when he disputes, he resorts to foul speech.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (34) and Muslim (58).\nSecondly:\nThe prohibition on telling lies when joking is proven in the Sunnah:\nIt was narrated that Bahz ibn Hakim said: My father told me that his father said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “Woe to the one who speaks and tells lies in order to make the people laugh; woe to him, woe to him.” Narrated by Abu Dawood (4990); classed as hasan by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud (4990).\nIt is also encouraged to refrain from lying when joking:\nIt was narrated that Abu Umamah said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “I guarantee a palace on the outskirts of Paradise for one who refrains from arguing even if he is in the right, and a house in the middle of Paradise for one who refrains from lying even when he is joking, and a house in the highest part of Paradise for one who makes his attitude good.” Narrated by Abu Dawud (4800); classed as hasan by al-Albani in Silsilat al-Ahadith as-Sahihah, no. 273.\nIt was narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud said: It is not right to lie in earnest or in jest, or for any one of you to promise something to his child then not fulfil that promise. Narrated by al-Bukhari in al-Adab al-Mufrad (387).\nThirdly:\nJoking, whether it is based on truth or lies, has many scenarios:\n1. When the joke is based on truth, and there is no lying involved\nThe basic principle regarding this kind of joking is that it is permissible, if it is done from time to time and the individual is not joking most of the time, and it does not lead to obvious mischief.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe scholars said: The kind of joking that is not allowed is when one goes to extremes in joking and persists in that, for it provokes laughter, leads to hardheartedness, and distracts people from remembering Allah, may He be exalted, and focusing their religious duties. In many cases, it also leads to causing offence and development of grudges, and it undermines dignity and respect. As for joking that is free of such elements, that is what is permissible, and that is what the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to do. He (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) only used to do that on rare occasions, when it served a purpose, or to comfort the one addressed and put him at ease. There is nothing wrong with that at all; rather it is Sunnah and is encouraged, if it is of this type.""(Al-Adhkar\xa0 p. 377).\n2. When the joke is based on a lie\nThis type of joking is prohibited, as seen in the hadith of Bahz ibn Hakim quoted above.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about someone who tells people stories that he has made up, and all of them are lies: is that permissible?\nHe replied: As for the one who tells made-up stories to make people laugh, or for some other purpose, he is disobeying Allah and His Messenger. Bahz ibn Hakim narrated from his father, from his grandfather, from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), who said: “The one who speaks and tells lies in order to make the people laugh, woe to him, woe to him, then woe to him.” And Ibn Mas‘ud said: It is not right to lie in earnest or in jest, or for any one of you to promise something to his child then not fulfil that promise.\nIf, however, that involves transgression against the Muslim, or it involves saying something that goes against Islamic teachings, then it is more emphatically prohibited. Whatever the case, the one who does that is deserving of shar‘i punishment [at the discretion of the qadi] that will deter him from doing it. And Allah knows best.""(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa\xa0 32/255-256).\nIn Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah (26/52), it says:\nQuestion: If, for example, we tell a lie as a joke, if that haram or not?\nAnswer: Yes, it is haram. In fact, it is a major sin, even if it is a joke.\nAnd Allah is the source of strength. May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.\nPermanent Committee for Academic Research and Ifta’\n‘Abdullah ibn Qa‘ud, ‘Abdullah ibn Ghadyan, ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ‘Afifi, ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baz.\nEnd quote.\n3. Joking by telling stories, when you are not certain whether they are true, but they could have happened \xa0\nWhat appears to be the case, based on the actions of some scholars, is that this type of joking is permissible. In the books of some of the scholars we find some funny stories that are attributed to people who lived centuries before, even though it is difficult to verify the stories. But there is no deliberate intention to tell a lie or to transmit a lie, even if the teller does not make an effort to verify the story and ensure that what he is transmitting is true.\nShaykh ‘Abd al-Muhsin az-Zamil said:\nInteresting and funny stories are of three types:\n\nStories which we know to be true. There is nothing wrong with this type, on condition that the story does not contain any haram elements, mocking of others or backbiting. It must be free of these things. If the story is permissible, there are no reservations about it, and if it is something that really happened or is most likely to have happened, there is nothing wrong with that.\nStories which are known to be lies and did not happen. It is not permissible to tell these stories.\nStories regarding which it is not known whether they happened or not. There is nothing wrong with telling these stories.\n\nHence the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Narrate from the Children of Israel, with no reservations.” Among the stories that are narrated from them are strange and amazing stories that may have happened, so he told the Muslims to narrate from them, and stated that in some of the stories that are narrated from them there are things that are even more amazing.\nAbu Dawud narrated with a jayyid (good) isnad that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to narrate stories from the Children of Israel after ‘Isha’ prayer, and he would not be interrupted for anything except for the obligatory prayer.\nThis highlights the fact that he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would sometimes address them for a long time after ‘Isha’ prayer.\nAs noted above, there is nothing wrong with telling these stories regarding which it is not known whether they happened or not, if they are not known to be lies, as Ibn Kathir and a number of other scholars pointed out. End quote.\n4. Imaginary stories which the listeners know are imaginary and did not really happen\nIf these entertaining stories are made up and told to serve a purpose, such as using them as a means to teach and educate, and the like, then a number of scholars have issued fatwas stating that they are permissible.\nShaykh Muhammad Rashid Rida (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWith regard to these imaginary stories, which are akin to the maqamat stories [which are written in rhymed prose] written by our earlier scholars, which were read in religious schools and other schools, such as the Maqamat of al-Badi‘ and the Maqamat of al-Hariri... he – i.e., al-Hariri – said that he did not know any of the scholars of the ummah in his time who forbade such stories which are made up about animals, such as the book of Kalilah wa Dimnah and the like, because the purpose behind them was beneficial exhortations, and the details of the story are not the main purpose. We have never heard of any scholar after him who forbade reading his Maqamat.""(Fatawa al-Imam Muhammad Rashid Rida\xa0 3/1091-1092).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf someone wants to present an example when telling a story, such as if he says: I am going to tell you of the example of a man who said such and such, or did such and such, and such and such happened, and the outcome was such and such, there is nothing wrong with this, to the extent that one of the scholars said regarding the verse {And present to them an example of two men: We granted to one of them two gardens of grapevines, and We bordered them with palm trees and placed between them [fields of] crops} [al-Kahf 18:32]: This did not really happen, and in the Qur’an it says: {Allah presents an example: a slave owned by quarreling partners and another belonging exclusively to one man - are they equal in comparison? Praise be to Allah! But most of them do not know} [az-Zumar 39:29]. So if someone tells a story and does not attribute it to a specific person, but it is as if something happened, and the outcome was such and such, there is nothing wrong with that.\nBut if he attributes it to someone and it is false, then this is haram and is a lie. The same applies if the purpose of telling the story is to make people laugh, because it is narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that he said: “Woe to the one who speaks and lies in order to make the people laugh; woe to him, then woe to him.”""(Liqa’ al-Bab al-Maftuh\xa077/23).\nShaykh Ibn Jibrin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\nIt is common among some of our brothers to tell interesting stories which involve lies in order to make people laugh, and when we advise them [not to do that], they say: It is permissible to tell interesting stories if it could have happened, even if you do not know whether it actually happened. Is that correct?\nHe replied:\nThe word translated here as “interesting stories” is used to refer to strange stories, and usually they are things that happened, but they could be imaginary. The purpose of that is to present an example, as al-Hariri did in his Maqamat, and as others did who wrote books containing these interesting stories.\nBut it is prohibited to tell lies for the purpose of making people laugh. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Woe to the one who speaks and tells lies in order to make the people laugh; woe to him, woe to him.”\nBut if the audience knows that this is an imaginary tale and did not really happen, but it could have happened, so it is a warning against a similar thing that could happen, or it is preparing people for such possible events, then this is permissible. And Allah knows best. End quote.\nWhat may be understood from the fatwas of Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin and Shaykh Ibn Jibrin (may Allah have mercy on them both) is that this permissibility is restricted to the kind of imaginary story that is told for a purpose or as a lesson, and is not about a particular person. If the story is made up about a particular person, or is made up just to make people laugh, then that is not permissible.\nAmong the earlier scholars who held a similar view was Ibn Hajar al-Haytami ash-Shafa‘i (may Allah have mercy on him), who said:\nThe sahih hadith “Narrate from the Children of Israel, with no reservations” and the report which says “Wonders occurred among them” indicate that it is permissible to listen to such wondrous stories for entertainment and not for any other purpose. End quote.\nFrom this it may be understood that it is permissible to listen to strange and wondrous stories, or any stories regarding which we cannot be certain that they are lies, for the purpose of entertainment, and even if it is certain that it is a lie, but the purpose is to give an example, exhort and educate, such as encouragement to be brave in the imaginary words of humans or animals.""(Tuhfat al-Muhtaj bi Sharh al-Minhaj\xa0 9/398).\n5. What we understand from what is mentioned in the question – Is it permissible to joke by saying mocking words, such as when through his tone of voice, a person indicates that what he means is something other than what he is saying? \xa0– is that this is referring to when a man says to his friend: Do you have such and such? And the friend answers: No, but from his joking tone of voice, the questioner will understand that what he means is yes.\nIn this case, if we only focus on the words, then it is a lie, because no is the opposite of yes.\nBut if we look at what the listener understands from the context, it may not be a lie, because the meaning that the listener understood was correct, and because words may have different meanings depending on the context in which they are said and the way in which they are uttered. So, for example, the phrase “What is this?” is a question, but a person may sometimes say it in a particular tone of voice from which what is understood is amazement or objection, and the like.\nSimilar to that is what was narrated from ash-Sha‘bi (may Allah have mercy on him), that a dull-witted man met ash-Sha‘bi and a woman who was walking with him, and he said: Which of you is ash-Sha‘bi? He said: She is. The scholars mentioned this story; it was mentioned by adh-Dhahabi in Siyar A‘lam an-Nubala’ (4/311), without comment.\nThe ruling on this type of story is not clear, and we have not come across any scholarly views concerning it. What is most likely to be the case is that there is a concession allowing this type, especially when there is another strong and clear indication to indicate what is meant, although it would have been better not to narrate the story, so as to avoid a dubious matter. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “That which is halal is clear and that which is haram is clear, and between them are doubtful matters of which many people are not aware. Whoever guards against the doubtful matters will protect his religious commitment from shortcomings and will protect his honour from slander, but whoever falls into that which is doubtful will fall into that which is haram, like a shepherd who grazes his flock around private land; he will soon graze in it…” Narrated by al-Bukhari (52).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/217461/examples-of-permissible-kinds-of-joking-and-the-ruling-on-telling-made-up-jokes
