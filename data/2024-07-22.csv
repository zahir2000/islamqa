226230,"Publishing houses write at the beginning of many of their books words to the effect of “No part of this book may be reproduced or photocopied without written permission from the publisher.” If I find these books published for free on the Internet, and available to anyone who wants to download them, is it permissible to download them and read them?","['Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with downloading e-books published on the Internet, or reading them, because one of the following two scenarios must apply to them:\nThe first scenario:\nThe book has been published with the permission of its author or copyright holder – which applies to many books, praise be to Allah – as the authors of these books and papers want to spread knowledge by electronic means, seeking reward with Allah, may He be exalted.\nThe second scenario:\nThe book has been published without the permission of the copyright holders, but the aim of downloading it and reading it is personal benefit, not commercial publication or to get hold of work done by others in order to alter it and claim it as one’s own work.\nIn that case, the author or publishing house has no right to prevent educated readers and seekers of knowledge from reading and downloading these books that have been published electronically.\nWhat has been issued of statements by Fiqh Councils acknowledging copyright should be understood within the framework of regulating commercial benefits first and foremost and, secondly, preventing the mischief of plagiarism and forgery. It is not intended to completely forbid any form of benefitting from the books, to the extent that some of them regard merely quoting from a book or article and attributing it to the author as a transgression of copyright, unless one has obtained special permission beforehand for this exact quotation.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about the ruling on photocopying books, and he replied:\nWhat we think is that if it is for personal use, there is nothing wrong with it. But if it is for commercial gain, then it is not permissible, because it is detrimental to the publishers’ or authors’ interests.""(Thamarat at-Tadwin\xa0 p.142).\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) also said:\nWhat I think is that if an individual makes a copy for himself only, there is nothing wrong with that. But if he makes copies in order to sell them, this is not permissible, because it is harming others, and it is akin to underselling a fellow Muslim, because if they are selling [a book] for one hundred [riyals], and you make copies and sell it for fifty, this is underselling your brother.""(Liqa’ al-Bab al-Maftuh\xa0178/19).\nHere we are not trying to discuss this complicated issue in detail and list the different scholarly views regarding it in all circumstances and categories. Rather our aim here is to highlight that there is nothing wrong with the seeker of knowledge, educated person or researcher downloading books that he comes across on the Internet. But he should take care with quotations and attribute them to their sources, and he should not make any commercial gain as a result of downloading or publishing it, especially when the two types of reasons mentioned above are mingled in cyberspace, so no one has the right to prohibit what is in principle permissible on the basis of doubt or some unique circumstances.\nPraise be to Allah, the academic and publishing markets have proven that e-publishing is a different market to paper publishing, and one of them does not cancel out the other; rather each of them has its own customers.\nSee also the answers to questions no. 116782 and 81614 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/226230/ruling-on-downloading-e-books-and-making-use-of-them
130235,"During practical tests in medicine, we are asked to figure out the illness that the patient has. Sometimes the patient tells us what illness he has without the student asking. Is it permissible to write that down, or is that regarded as cheating, because he did not work it out himself? Likewise, if he hears it from any other person without asking him, can he write that down?","['Praise be to Allah.If the student knows the diagnosis and the patient tells him without him asking him, there is nothing wrong with the student writing down what he already knows. That is not regarded as cheating, because he knew the answer before the patient told him.\nBut if the student did not know the diagnosis, but the patient told him without him asking, or he found out the diagnosis from some of his colleagues without meaning to, such as if he overheard it, then in that case he must tell the doctor who is supervising the test what really happened. This is a precaution, and this is the best approach.\nHowever, if he benefitted from what he heard and wrote it in the test, then we hope that there is no blame on him, because he did not mean to do that. We heard our shaykh Muhammad ibn al-‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) being asked about a student in the exam hall who, without meaning to, heard the answer to a question that he did not know from other students nearby; is it permissible for him to write it or not?\nHe replied that it is permissible, because he did not deliberately commit a sin or infraction. He made an analogy with what the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said regarding one who is fasting: “Whoever forgets that he is fasting and eats or drinks, let him complete his fast, for Allah has fed him and given him to drink.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (1933) and Muslim (1155). According to the version narrated by ad-Daraqutni: “It is provision that Allah granted to him.” Ibn al-Qayyim said: This is a sahih isnad.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/130235/if-the-student-hears-the-answer-to-a-question-in-the-test-without-meaning-to-can-he-write-it
149336,"In the answer to question no. 60188 , it says: “If a person departs this world having won the pleasure of Allah, then he will have the glad tidings of all that is good after that… He will have all that he wishes for in the best ways. Everything that he asks for will be granted.","['Praise be to Allah.Are the delights of Paradise only for men?\nYou should understand that Paradise and its delights are not only for men, to the exclusion of women. Rather they are, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {prepared for the righteous} [Al `Imran 3:133] of both genders, as Allah, may He be exalted, tells us elsewhere (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And whoever does righteous deeds, whether male or female, while being a believer - those will enter Paradise and will not be wronged, [even as much as] the speck on a date seed.}\xa0[An-Nisa’ 4:124]\n{Whoever does righteousness, whether male or female, while he is a believer - We will surely cause him to live a good life, and We will surely give them their reward [in the Hereafter] according to the best of what they used to do.}\xa0[An-Nahl 16:97]\nWhen Allah mentions the delights that exist in paradise, namely different kinds of foods, beautiful scenery, dwellings and clothing, that includes both genders (male and female). Both will enjoy what is mentioned above.\nIt was narrated from Umm `Umarah Al-Ansariyyah that she came to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and said: I cannot see anything but it is for the men, and I do not see anything mentioned for women. Then this verse was revealed (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Indeed, the Muslim men and Muslim women, the believing men and believing women, the obedient men and obedient women, the truthful men and truthful women, the patient men and patient women, the humble men and humble women, the charitable men and charitable women, the fasting men and fasting women, the men who guard their private parts and the women who do so, and the men who remember Allah often and the women who do so - for them Allah has prepared forgiveness and a great reward.}\xa0[Al-Ahzab 33:35] (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi (3211); it is also in\xa0Sahih At-Tirmidhi\xa0(2565)\nBased on that, everything that is mentioned of the delights of Paradise is for both men and women equally.\nDescription of the women of Paradise\nAllah, may He be exalted, has described the women of Paradise as restraining or limiting their glances in three places in the Quran:\n\n{In them are women limiting [their] glances, untouched before them by man or jinni.}\xa0[Ar-Rahman 55:56]\n{And with them will be women limiting [their] glances, with large, [beautiful] eyes.}\xa0[As-Saffat 37:48]\n{And with them will be women limiting [their] glances and of equal age.}\xa0[Sad 38:52]\n\nThe commentators are of the view that what is meant is that they will restrain their glances, looking only at their husbands , and they will not want to look at anyone else; they will not see anyone in Paradise more handsome than their husbands. This was stated by Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah, `Ata’ Al-Khurasani, and Ibn Zayd.\nIt was narrated that one of them will say to her husband: By Allah I have not seen anything in Paradise more handsome than you, or anything in Paradise that is dearer to me than you. Praise be to Allah Who has made you for me and has made me for you. (Hadi Al-Arwah)\nThis sublime description and praise of the women of Paradise comes from Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, which indicates that the matter is not as you think, that a woman in Paradise will be longing for a man other than her husband, or that that will reduce her bliss in Paradise or spoil her joy therein. For Paradise is the abode of everlasting, eternal bliss, wherein there will be no worry, toil, distress or grief.\nThe fact that a man will have more than one wife in Paradise does not mean that there will be any shortcoming in the joy and pleasure of any of his wives, as is the case in this world, for the delights of Paradise are different from the delights of this world.\nThat includes what was narrated by Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), who said: “The believer in Paradise will be given such and such strength for sexual intercourse.” He was asked, “O Messenger of Allah, will he really be able to do that?” He said, “He will be given the strength of one hundred (men).” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi (2536). Al-Albani said: “It is authentic because of corroborating evidence.” (Mishkat Al-Masabih, 536)\nAccording to a Marfu` Hadith narrated by Zayd ibn Arqam: “By the One in Whose hand is my soul, one of them will be given the strength of a hundred men with regard to eating, drinking, desire and intercourse… (Narrated by Ahmad (18783); classed as authentic by Al-Albani in\xa0Sahih Al-Jami`, 1627)\nFor more details, please see the following answer:\xa011419 , 257509 , 8068 , 59896 , 173281 , and 160965 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/149336/how-many-husbands-will-a-woman-have-in-jannah
