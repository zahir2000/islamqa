487991,"Some time ago, I felt that I did not believe in God, and that Orthodox Christianity does not exist as a religion as far as I am concerned. But after that, I began to examine some other religions and sects, such as Babism, Buddhism and Islam. I would like someone to educate me about Islam, because I do not know where to start before accepting Islam. Can I, as an Orthodox Christian, go to the mosque and speak to the imam after the prayer ends? I am worried in case my relatives become suspicious of me, because my father criticised Islam and he is an atheist, and my father’s relatives are Korean Orthodox, but they respect Buddhist traditions. It will be very embarrassing for me to say that I am going to move to South Korea and at the same time tell them that I have embraced Islam.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nWe praise Allah, may He be exalted, for having enabled you to take an interest in Islam, and we ask Him to complete the blessing He has bestowed upon you by enabling you to accept Islam, feel at ease with it and enter the faith. This is an immense blessing from Allah, may He be exalted, to a person; in fact it is the greatest of His blessings, because it leads to happiness in this world and the hereafter.\nWe ask Allah, may He be exalted, to guide you to the straight path, increase you in guidance and steadfastness, and complete the blessing that He has bestowed upon you. We Muslims would welcome you as an honoured guest in any of our mosques, anywhere in the world, and you can sit with the imam, ask him whatever you want to ask him and listen to him. You will see how you will be welcomed and honoured in a way that you never expected, because we Muslims love goodness and guidance for all people, and we would love all people to believe in Allah and have sound faith in Him so that they may attain His pleasure, and Allah will reward them with paradise in the hereafter.\nSecondly:\nTo sum up Islam in a few words, it means obeying Allah, may He be exalted, and worshipping Him alone, with no partner or associate.\nAllah, may He be exalted, is the only Creator and Provider and He alone is in control of all things.\nAllah, may He be exalted, is the only one Whom people should worship, so no one is to be worshipped except Allah; no prophet, no angel, no jinni, no human, no rock, no tree, nothing is to be worshipped except Him.\nJust as Allah alone is the Creator Who is in control of all things, He alone is to be worshipped.\nIf you would like us to quote a brief verse which sums up all of Islam for you, it is the verse in which the Lord of the Worlds says in His holy Book (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Say, “Indeed, my prayer, my rites of sacrifice, my living and my dying are for Allah, Lord of the worlds\nNo partner has He. And this I have been commanded, and I am the first [among you] of the Muslims.”}\xa0[al-An‘am 6:162-163].\nIt was narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Islam is built on five (pillars): testimony that there is no god worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger, establishing regular prayer, paying zakah, pilgrimage to the House and fasting Ramadan.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (8) and Muslim (16).\nAccording to another report narrated by Muslim: “Islam is built on five (pillars): affirming the Oneness of Allah (Tawhid)…” What is meant by affirming the oneness of Allah is testifying that there is no god worthy of worship except Allah alone, with no partner or associate, and that Muhammad is His slave and His Messenger.\nAccording to another report also narrated by Muslim: “Islam is built on five (pillars): worshipping Allah and rejecting all false gods…” Affirming the oneness of Allah also means that we worship Him alone, with no partner or associate. That requires disbelieving in and rejecting all false gods that worshipped besides Allah, otherwise we are not affirming His oneness.\nThirdly:\nPeople cannot know the laws and rulings in accordance with which Allah wants them to worship Him, because they do not receive them from Him directly. Therefore Allah chose the best of humanity, namely the prophets and messengers, and made them intermediaries between Him and His creation in conveying His laws and rulings.\nThe prophets began with the father of humanity, Adam (peace be upon him) and ended with our Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). In between there came a large number of prophets, such as Noah (Nuh), Abraham (Ibrahim), Moses (Moosa), Jesus (‘Isa) and others, blessings and peace of Allah be upon them all.\nAll of them were human, and they only came to call people to worship Allah alone. None of them said that he was divine or the son of God, for such notions are associating others with Allah, and that is contrary to the message with which Allah sent them.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{ It is not for a human [prophet] that Allah should give him the Scripture and authority and prophethood and then he would say to the people, “Be servants to me rather than Allah,” but [instead, he would say], “Be pious scholars of the Lord because of what you have taught of the Scripture and because of what you have studied.”\nNor could he order you to take the angels and prophets as lords. Would he order you to disbelief after you had been Muslims? }\xa0[Al ‘Imran 3:79-80].\nAs affirming the oneness of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, and worshipping Him alone, with no partner or associate, is the essential message of all the prophets, Allah, may He be exalted, explained that to His slaves in their scriptures, and He drew their attention to sound evidence which confirms that in what they see around them. There are also significant verses in the Book of Allah which draw people’s attention to what they see in the universe around them; these verses remind them that Allah is the only Bestower of these blessings, the only Creator thereof, therefore they must believe that He alone is God of this universe. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{ Say, [O Muhammad], “To whom belongs the earth and whoever is in it, if you should know?”\nThey will say, “To Allah.” Say, “Then will you not remember?”\nSay, “Who is Lord of the seven heavens and Lord of the Great Throne?”\n\xa0They will say, “[They belong] to Allah.” Say, “Then will you not fear Him?”\nSay, “In whose hand is the realm of all things - and He protects while none can protect against Him - if you should know?”\nThey will say, “[All belongs] to Allah.” Say, “Then how are you deluded?”""\nRather, We have brought them the truth, and indeed they are liars.\nAllah has not taken any son, nor has there ever been with Him any deity. [If there had been], then each deity would have taken what it created, and some of them would have sought to overcome others. Exalted is Allah above what they describe [concerning Him].\n\xa0[He is] Knower of the unseen and the seen, so exalted be He above what they associate [with Him] }\xa0[al-Mu’minun 23:84-92].\nThere are other marvellous verses in the Book of the Lord of the Worlds which say that worshipping Allah alone, with no partner or associate, is the essential message of all the prophets, then after that, Allah mentions the misguidance of the polytheist Arabs and others who ascribe partners in divinity to Allah, such as the angels, the messengers or other created beings. These verses proved that to be false, and told them that the angels are honourable slaves who obey and submit to the Lord of the Worlds, and that the prophets (blessings and peace of Allah be upon them) were all human, created beings who die, and they are not divine at all. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{ And We sent not before you any messenger except that We revealed to him that, “There is no deity except Me, so worship Me.”\nAnd they say, “The Most Merciful has taken a son.” Exalted is He! Rather, they are [but] honored servants.\nThey do not speak until He has spoken, and they act by His command.\nHe knows what is [presently] before them and what will be after them, and they cannot intercede except on behalf of one whom He approves. And they, from fear of Him, are apprehensive.\nAnd whoever of them should say, “Indeed, I am a god besides Him”- that one We would recompense with Hell. Thus do We recompense the wrongdoers.\nHave those who disbelieved not considered that the heavens and the earth were a joined entity, and We separated them and made from water every living thing? Then will they not believe?\nAnd We placed within the earth firmly set mountains, lest it should shift with them, and We made therein [mountain] passes [as] roads that they might be guided.\nAnd We made the sky a protected ceiling, but they, from its signs, are turning away.\nAnd it is He who created the night and the day and the sun and the moon; all [heavenly bodies] in an orbit are swimming.\nAnd We did not grant to any man before you eternity [on earth]; so if you die - would they be eternal?\nEvery soul will taste death. And We test you with evil and with good as trial; and to Us you will be returned}\xa0[al-Anbiya’ 21:25-25].\nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 12628 .\nFourthly:\nAs for what the Orthodox Christians and others say, that Jesus is the son of God or that Jesus is God, this is one of the most grievous fabrications against Allah. Allah, may He be exalted, says in His holy Book (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And they say, “The Most Merciful has taken [for Himself] a son.”\nIndeed, you have uttered something atrocious.\nThe heavens almost rupture therefrom and the earth splits open and the mountains collapse in devastation,\nThat they attribute to the Most Merciful a son.\nAnd it is not appropriate for the Most Merciful that He should take a son.\nThere is no one in the heavens and earth but he comes to the Most Merciful as a servant\nHe has enumerated them and counted them a [full] counting,\nAnd all of them will come to Him on the Day of Resurrection alone}[Maryam 19:88-95].\nIt is invalid according to rational thinking, just as it is invalid because Allah, may He be exalted, has told us that He is one. How can Jesus be a son of God, when God has no wife? Exalted be Allah far above such a thing.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{[He is] Originator of the heavens and the earth. How could He have a son when He does not have a companion and He created all things? And He has full knowledge of all things}[al-An‘am 6:101].\nMoreover, how could Jesus be God or the son of God when he and his mother ate food as all people eat; they needed that and then they would have to deal with the consequences thereof, like any other people? Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{The Messiah, son of Mary, was not but a messenger; [other] messengers have passed on before him. And his mother was a supporter of truth. They both used to eat food. Look how We make clear to them the signs; then look how they are deluded}[al-Ma’idah 5:75].\nLook at what Allah, may He be exalted, says: {They both used to eat food}. These words rule out any notion of divinity for the Messiah and his mother.\nTo explain further:\nThe one who eats food needs that food, and if he did not eat he would feel the pain of hunger, and if his hunger intensified, he could die.\nDoes it make sense that God could need to eat, and if He did not eat, He would feel pain or die?\nMoreover, there is another meaning to this verse, which is that the one who eats food will be carrying impurity and the waste matter from that food in his body, and he will need to go to the bathroom and excrete it. Does it make sense to think that God, Who is Most Holy – meaning that He is far above all defects and shortcomings – could be carrying impurity and need to go to the bathroom?!\nFurthermore, the Christians believe that the Messiah came down and his enemies were able to capture him, beat him, spit in his face, torture him, crucify him and kill him. Can any rational mind accept that God would be helpless before His enemies and that they would be able to mistreat Him in such a way?\nFor more information, please see the answers to questions no. 82361 and 224199 .\nWe cannot discuss everything that has to do with Islam and Christianity in this brief answer – you can read what is available on this website about these topics – but it is sufficient that we have opened the way for you, and we encourage you to go to the mosque or Islamic centre that is closest to your house, where you will find answers to all your questions, if Allah wills.\nYou should note that entering Islam is not difficult. All that is needed is for you to say, “Ashhadu an la ilaha illa Allah wa ashhadu anna Muhammadan rasool Allah (I bear witness that there is no god worthy of worship except Allah and I bear witness that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah).” By doing so, you will be cleansed of all your previous sins, and you will start a new, blank page in your record of deeds, with no bad deeds; it will be as if you were born today.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Say to those who disbelieve that if they desist, what is past will be forgiven; but if they persist, then the precedent of the earlier peoples is already established}\xa0[al-Anfal 8:38].\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Islam erases that which came before it.”\nIn other words, it waives the punishment and removes the traces of previous sins.\nSo hasten to become Muslim, for this life may end suddenly; no one knows when death will come upon him.\nFifthly:\nAs for your fears regarding your relatives, you do not have to announce your Islam to them; rather you may conceal from them the fact that you have become Muslim. The companions of our Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in Makkah concealed their Islam from the polytheists of Makkah for fear that they might harm them and mistreat them.\nThen when you have the opportunity to tell them about your being Muslim later on, you can tell them and call your family to Islam, and strive to save them from the fire of hell.\nThis is a great favour that you can do for them. We ask Allah, may He be exalted, to guide you, support you and make you steadfast in faith.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/487991/an-orthodox-christian-wants-to-become-muslim-but-he-does-not-know-where-to-start
65731,"I know that it's not allowed to pray if you have ""Janabet"" Now if someone have prayed with ""Janabet"" then what is the ruling of Islam on him. Let me make the situation a little more clear. This person's age was 20~21. And he went with his dad to mosque, over there his father ""Ordered"" him to conduct Jamat (Nimaz). Now in this situation the guy was not able to tell his dad that he is in ""Janabet"" and needs Ghusl, so he did the ""Wudu"" and conducted the jamat. Now from inside, he is totally broken, and worried about his SIN, he read in one book that if you conduct ""Salat"" without Wudu, then you are OUT OF ISLAM !!! .... Now in this situation what does he have to do ? Is he Out of ISLAM or NOT ? How he can overcome of his this SIM ... and do TOWBA ? Do he need to do his EMAN's TAJDEED ? I will be looking forward to hearing from your side, a detailed answer. I know that you have said that you ask only related to Ramadan questions, but I have discovered your site now. So I hope that when u will have time then u will reply to this IMPORTANT question. My friend is really in Mental Trouble due to what happened.","['Praise be to Allah.What happens if you deliberately pray without Wudu?\nIt is well known and no Muslim has any excuse for not knowing that purification from impurity, whether minor or major, is obligatory and is a condition of prayer being valid. Whoever prays without purifying himself , whether deliberately or by mistake, his prayer is invalid and he has to repeat it; if it is done deliberately then he has committed a major sin.\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“The Muslim should not pray facing any direction other than the Qiblah, or without doing Wudu , bowing and prostrating. Whoever does that deserves to be rebuked and punished.” (Minhaj As-Sunnah An-Nabawiyyah, 5/204\xa0)\nThere is a stern warning issued to one who does that. It was narrated from `Abdullah ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “It was ordered that one of the slaves of Allah be flogged in his grave with one hundred lashes, but he kept asking until it was reduced to a single blow. So he was given a single blow, then his grave was filled with fire. When he came round, he said: `Why did you flog me?` It was said to him: `You offered one prayer without being in a state of purity , and you passed by one who was being wronged and did not help him.`” (Narrated by At-Tahawi in Mushkil Al-Athar, 4/231; classed as sound by Al-Albani in As-Silsilah As-Sahihah, 2774)\xa0\nDoes praying without Wudu take one out of Islam?\nThe scholars agreed that whoever prays without being in a state of purity because he believes that it is permissible or out of disrespect is a disbeliever. He should be asked to repent, and if he repents, all well and good, otherwise he should be executed.\xa0\nBut if he prays without Wudu out of negligence, not because he thinks it is permissible or out of disrespect, Imam Abu Hanifah (may Allah have mercy on him) is of the view that this is also disbelief. However, the majority of scholars are of the view that he is not a disbeliever, rather he has committed a major sin.\xa0\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \xa0\n“If he knows that he is impure and that it is prohibited to pray when one is impure , then he has committed a grave sin, but he does not become a disbeliever thereby in our view, unless he regards that as permissible. But Abu Hanifah said: He has committed disbelief because of his disrespect.\xa0\nOur evidence is that it is a sin so it is akin to zina and the like.” (Al-Majmu` (2/84); Rawdat At-Talibin, 10/67)\n(See the Hanafi view in Al-Bahr Ar-Ra`iq, 1/302, 151; 5/132; Hashiyat Ibn `Abidin, 3/719)\nThe one who has prayed without purifying himself has to repent and seek forgiveness, and resolve not to do such a thing again, then he should repeat the prayer that he offered without purifying himself. Allah accepts the repentance of those who repent to Him. And he does not have to enter Islam anew.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/65731/what-happens-if-you-deliberately-pray-without-wudu
487558,"In Many Hadiths it is mentionned that whoever makes wudu in he’s house and then go to the masjid, he will have for each steps 1 good deed written,1 sin erased,and he will be raised in degree in jannah is this reward only for those who make wudu from their home or for example if someone makes wudu from he’s work,or from the toilet of a supermarket, or in the street he find a water point and makes he’s wudu there and go the the mosque will he get the reward too or to attain it a person have to go he’s home and perform ablution and then to the mosque to attain it?","['Praise be to Allah.Al-Bukhari (477) and Muslim (649) narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “A man’s prayer in congregation is twenty-five times better than his prayer in his house or his marketplace. That is because if one of you does wudu and does it well, then comes to the mosque, with no other motive or purpose than to pray, then he does not take any step but Allah will raise him one degree in status thereby, and will erase one sin from him thereby, until he enters the mosque. When he enters the mosque, he is in a state of prayer so long as the prayer is what is keeping him there, and the angels send blessings on him so long as he remains in the place where he prayed, saying, ‘O Allah, forgive him; O Allah, have mercy on him,’ so long as he does not break his wudu.”\nThis hadith is general in meaning, and includes doing wudu in one’s house or elsewhere.\nBased on that, if he does wudu in the place where he is, whether it is his house or the marketplace or the workplace, wherever he is, then he goes out from that place for no purpose except to pray, then he will attain the reward mentioned in this hadith.\nWith regard to the report narrated by Muslim (666) from Abu Hurayrah, who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever purifies himself in his house then walks to one of the houses of Allah in order to offer one of the obligatory prayers enjoined by Allah, for every two steps he takes, one will erase a sin and the other will raise him one degree in status”,\nthis report specifically refers to when he purifies himself at home. It is mentioned in this way because – and Allah knows best – this is what is mostly the case. Rather what is meant is that he does wudu in the place where he is, and for that reason there is a differentiation in virtue between his praying in the mosque and his praying at home or in the marketplace. The last two are both surpassed by prayer offered in congregation.\nAs-Suyuti said in al-Tawshih Sharh al-Jami‘ as-Sahih (2/680): “In his house or in his marketplace” refers to praying on his ow, which is what is mostly the case. This was stated by Ibn Daqiq al-‘Eid. End quote.\nAl-Minnawi said in at-Taysir (2/97): The house and the marketplace are singled out for mention to alert people to the fact that the multiplication of the reward will not apply in places other than the mosque. End quote.\nAs-Sindi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his commentary on the hadith, “Whoever does wudu in his house, then comes to Masjid Quba’ and offers a prayer there, he will have a reward like that of ‘umrah”:\nThis specific mention [of Masjid Quba’] is not the reason for attaining this reward; rather he mentioned it in order to highlight the fact that going to the mosque is only for the one whose house is close to it, so that he can purify himself at home and pray in the mosque with that purification, such as the people of Madinah and the people of Quba’, because they do not need to prepare themselves to travel. Preparing oneself to travel is not permissible except for the purpose of visiting the three mosques, and it is as if this is the reason why that specific matter was not mentioned in the previous hadith.""(Hashiyat as-Sindi ‘ala Sunan Ibn Majah\xa0 1/431).\nThat reward is dependent on all these conditions being met, namely that the person purifies himself in his house or the place where he is, then he walks to a mosque where prayer is offered in congregation, and he does not set out from the place where he is for any purpose except the prayer.\nIbn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) said: In al-Musnad and Sahih Ibn Hibban, it is narrated from ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever goes to the mosque to pray in congregation, for every two steps he takes, one will erase a bad deed and the other will earn him a good deed, on the way there and on the way back.”\nThis general statement is subject to two restrictions as mentioned in the hadith of Abu Salih from Abu Hurayrah, which was narrated by al-Bukhari, and was mentioned above and will be mentioned below:\n1. That he should come out of his house in a state of purity, having purified himself well and thoroughly.\n2. That he should only be going out for the purpose of praying in the mosque. If he goes out to do an errand, and the mosque is on his way, so he enters the mosque and prays, but he did not go out for that purpose, then he will not attain this particular reward.\nThe same applies if he goes out of his house without having purified himself, he will attain a different reward. However, this particular reward – which is being raised in status and having bad deeds erased – will be not be attained in this case.""(Fath al-Bari\xa0 6/32).\nConclusion:\nThis reward is restricted to one who purifies himself in his house or in the place where he is, then goes out for no purpose except to pray. The one who goes out without having purified himself, or goes out from the place where he is without having prayer as his primary aim is not one of those who will attain this particular reward.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/487558/the-reward-of-one-who-does-wudu-in-his-house-then-goes-to-the-mosque-will-this-reward-also-be-attained-by-one-who-does-wudu-in-his-workplace-or-in-the-marketplace
136695,I want to pray after the Sunnah of Fajr and before the Iqamah for the prayer. I want to pray whatever Allah wills I should pray until the Iqamah for the prayer is given. What is the ruling on that?,"['Praise be to Allah.The scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) differed concerning voluntary prayers after dawn has broken and before the Fajr prayer. The Hanbali view is that it is not allowed, except for the Sunnah prayer of Fajr only.\xa0\nIt says in Daqa’iq Uli An-Nuha, 1/272: “There are five times when prayer is not allowed , one of which is from the break of dawn until sunrise.”\nWhat is meant is that once dawn has broken, one should offer the two Rak`ahs of Fajr , then refrain from praying, because of the report narrated by Abu Dawud (1278) from Yasar, the freed slave of Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: Ibn `Umar saw me when I was praying after the break of dawn, and he said: O Yasar, the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came out to us when we were offering this prayer and said: “Let those of you who are present convey it to those of you who are absent: do not pray anything after dawn except two Rak`ahs.”\xa0\nThe Hadith was classed as authentic by Al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) in Sahih Abu Dawud.\xa0\nIn their view, this is based on the fact that the prohibition has to do with the time – which is the break of dawn, not with the act of prayer. There is another report from Ahmad, which is also the view of the Shafi`is, that the prohibition has to do with the act of prayer; hence, once one has prayed Fajr, one should refrain from praying, because of the report narrated by Abu Sa`id (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no prayer after `Asr prayer until the sun sets, and there is no prayer after Fajr prayer until the sun rises.” (Narrated by Muslim, 827)\nAccording to the Hadith of `Amr ibn `Abasah (may Allah be pleased with him) the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Pray Fajr, then refrain from praying until the sun rises.” (Narrated by Muslim, 823) What this means is that the time when prayer is not allowed begins when one has prayed Fajr, not when dawn breaks.\xa0(See: Al-Majmu`, 4/76; Al-Mughni, 1/428; Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah, 7/183)\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) thought that this opinion was more likely to be correct, so from after Fajr prayer until sunrise is the time when prayer is not allowed. But before Fajr prayer there is no time when prayer is not allowed, but it is not prescribed to do anything at that time except offer the two (Sunnah) Rak`ahs of Fajr, because this is what was narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and there is no report to suggest that he offered any voluntary prayer other than that.\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “But the correct view is that the prohibition has to do with Fajr prayer itself. As for the time between the adhan and iqamah, it is not included in the prohibition, however it is not prescribed to offer anything in that time apart from the two (Sunnah) Rak`ahs of Fajr. If this is the correct view, then what is the response concerning the Hadith that is quoted as evidence by the author?\xa0\nThe response to that notes two things:\xa0\n\nThat the Hadith is inauthentic\nEven if we assume that the Hadith is authentic, the words “There is no prayer after the break of dawn” may be understood as meaning that it is not prescribed for a person to offer any voluntary prayer other than the two (Sunnah) Rak`ahs of Fajr after the break of dawn, and that is true, because it is not appropriate for\xa0 a person, after the break of dawn, to offer any voluntary prayer except the two Sunnah Rak`ahs of Fajr. So if you enter the mosque and pray the two (Sunnah) Rak`ahs of Fajr , and the time for the (fard) prayer has not yet come, and you say, I shall offer a voluntary prayer, we would say to you: Do not do that, because this is not prescribed; but if you were to do it, you would not be sinning. Rather we say that it is not prescribed, because the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) only prayed two brief Rak`ahs after the break of dawn, and that is the Sunnah of Fajr prayer only. Moreover, even making the two Rak`ahs lengthy is not prescribed.” (Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti`, 4/51)\xa0\n\nShaykh Al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Note: Al-Bayhaqi narrated with an authentic chain of narrators from Sa`id ibn Al-Musayyab that he saw a man praying more than two Rak`ahs after dawn broke, bowing and prostrating a great deal, and he told him not to do that. The man said: O Abu Muhammad, will Allah punish me for praying? He said: No, but He will punish you for going against the Sunnah. This is an example of the brilliant answers of Sa`id ibn Al-Musayyab (may Allah have mercy on him), and it is a powerful weapon against the innovators who think many innovations are good on the grounds that they are dhikr (remembrance of Allah) and prayer, then they criticise Ahl as-Sunnah for criticising their actions and accuse them of forbidding dhikr and prayer!, When in fact they are only criticising their going against the Sunnah with regard to dhikr and prayer and so on.” (Irwa’ Al-Ghalil, 2/236)\n\xa0And Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/136695/can-we-pray-voluntary-prayers-after-the-sunnah-of-fajr
