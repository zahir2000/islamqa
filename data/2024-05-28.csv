457850,Is it permissible to pray the two rak‘ahs following tawaf [circumambulation of the Ka‘bah] outside the mataf [area surrounding the Ka‘bah where tawaf is done]?,"['Praise be to Allah.It is Sunnah to pray two rak‘ahs following any tawaf, and it is mustahabb [recommended] to do that behind Maqam Ibrahim [the Station of Abraham].\nAl-Bukhari (1627) and Muslim (1234) narrated that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came and circumambulated the House seven times and prayed two rak‘ahs behind the Maqam, then he went out to as-Safa; and Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {Verily, in the Messenger of Allah you have a good example} [al-Ahzab 33:21]. It is permissible to pray these two rak‘ahs anywhere in the mosque, or in Makkah and the Haram zone.\nImam Malik narrated in al-Muwatta’ (1/368) from Humayd ibn ‘Abd ar-Rahman ibn ‘Awf that ‘Abd ar-Rahman ibn ‘Abd al-Qari’ told him that he circumambulated the Ka‘bah with ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab after Fajr prayer. When ‘Umar had finished his tawaf, he looked around and saw that the sun had not risen, so he rode his mount until he halted in Dhu Tuwa, where he prayed two rak‘ahs.\nIbn al-Mundhir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is soundly narrated that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) circumambulated the Ka‘bah, then he prayed two rak‘ahs at the Maqam.\nThe scholars are unanimously agreed that wherever the one who has completed tawaf prays the two rak‘ahs following tawaf, it is acceptable, apart from Malik, who regarded it as makruh (disliked) to pray the two tak‘ahs following tawaf in the Hijr [semi-circular area next to the Ka‘bah]. End quote from al-Ishraf (3/287).\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is Sunnah for the one who has completed tawaf to pray two rak‘ahs after completing it, and it is recommended to offer this prayer behind the Maqam, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {Take the Station of Ibrahim as a place of prayer} [al-Baqarah 2:125].\nWherever he prays these two rak‘ahs and whatever he recites in them, it is permissible, as ‘Umar prayed them in Dhu Tuwa.""(Al-Mughni\xa0 3/347).\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is not obligatory for the one who has completed tawaf to pray the two rak‘ahs behind Maqam Ibrahim. Rather it is prescribed for him to do that if he is able to do it without difficulty, but if he prays them anywhere in al-Masjid al-Haram or in any place in the entire Haram zone, that is acceptable.\nIt is not prescribed for him to push and shove with those who are still circumambulating in order to pray these two rak‘ahs at the Maqam. Rather he should keep away from the crowds and pray them in another part of al-Masjid al-Haram, because on one occasion ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) prayed the two rak‘ahs following tawaf in Dhu Tuwa, which is part of the Haram zone, but it is outside al-Masjid al-Haram. Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) also prayed the two rak‘ahs following tawaf outside al-Masjid al-Haram. What appears to be the case is that the reason she did that was because of the crowds, or because by doing that, she intended to demonstrate to the people how flexible this matter is according to Islamic teachings.""(Fatawa Ibn Baz\xa017/228).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Those who pray behind the Maqam and insist on praying there, when those who are circumambulating the Ka‘bah need the space, are wronging themselves and wronging others. They are sinning, transgressing and doing wrong. They have no right to this space, and you have the right to push them away, you have the right to walk in front of them, and you have the right to step over them when they are prostrating, because they have no right to this space at all.\nThe fact that they insist on being in that place is undoubtedly due to their ignorance, because the two rak‘ahs following tawaf may be done in any part of the mosque. A person can move away from the place where people are circumambulating and pray two rak‘ahs. The caliph ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) even prayed the two rak‘ahs following tawaf in Dhu Tuwa, which is far away from al-Masjid al-Haram, and is not even part of it.\nThe individual must fear Allah regarding himself and fear Allah regarding his brothers. So he should not pray behind Maqam Ibrahim when people need that space for tawaf. He has no protection [in this case, according to Islamic teachings] and we have the right to push him, we have the right to interrupt his prayer, and we have the right to step over him when he is prostrating, because he is the one who is transgressing and doing wrong – Allah forbid.""(Fatawa ‘Ulama’ al-Balad al-Haram\xa0 p. 220).\nConclusion:\nIt is permissible to pray the two rak‘ahs following tawaf in any place in Makkah and the Haram zone. The best is to pray them behind Maqam Ibrahim, if there are no crowds and you will not cause any obstruction or make it difficult for those who are circumambulating the Ka‘bah by praying behind Maqam Ibrahim.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/457850/what-is-the-ruling-on-praying-the-two-rakahs-following-tawaf-outside-the-mataf-area
20847,"Is it permissible for a woman to do her usual household duties such as cooking, looking after the children, and housework, before she does Ghusl following intercourse?","[""Praise be to Allah.Is it permissible for a woman to do housework when she is Junub?\nIt is prohibited for the person who is Junub (in a state of impurity following sexual activity) to pray, perform Tawaf, stay in the mosque, recite Quran or touch the Mus-haf. Everything else is permissible.\xa0\nThere is nothing wrong with a woman who is Junub cooking, looking after her house , taking care of her children or fulfilling any other needs. This is indicated by several pieces of evidence including the following:\xa0\n\nIt was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) met him on one of the roads of Madinah when he was Junub. He said: I turned back and went and did Ghusl , then I came. He said: “Where were you, O Abu Hurayrah?” I said: “I was Junub and I did not like to sit with you when I was not in a state of purity.” He said, “Subhan Allah, the Muslim does not become impure.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 279 and Muslim, 371)\xa0\n\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “This indicates that it is permissible to delay doing Ghusl from the time when it first becomes obligatory, and that it is permissible for the one who is Junub to go about his business.” (Fat-h Al-Bari, 1/391)\xa0\nThe recommendation to hasten to do Ghusl after intercourse\xa0\nIt is better for the one who is Junub to hasten to do Ghusl, lest he forgets that he is Junub. And it is recommended for him to do Wudu before he touches food and drink and before going to sleep. That is better than doing these things when he is Junub. But this Wudu is not obligatory, rather it serves to reduce the impurity, and it is recommended. There are a number of Hadiths concerning that, including the following:\xa0\n\nIt was narrated that `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was Junub and wanted to eat or sleep, he would do Wudu as for prayer. (Narrated by Muslim, 305)\nIt was narrated from Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that `Umar ibn Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) asked the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “Can one of us go to sleep when he is Junub?” He said: “Yes, if he does Wudu then he can go to sleep when he is Junub.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 283 and Muslim, 306)\n\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“This indicates that it is recommended to do Wudu and to wash one's private parts before doing all these things, especially if the man wants to have intercourse with a wife with whom he has not yet had intercourse. It is definitely recommended to wash one's private parts. Our companions have stated that it is disliked to sleep, eat, drink or have intercourse before doing Wudu, and these Hadiths indicate that. There is no dispute among us that this Wudu is not obligatory. This is also the view of Malik and the majority.” (Sharh Muslim, 3/217)\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \xa0\n“It is recommended for the one who is Junub to do Wudu if he wants to eat, drink, sleep or have intercourse again, but it is disliked for him to sleep if he has not done Wudu. It was proven in an authentic narration that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was asked, “Can one of us go to sleep when he is Junub?” He said: “Yes, if he does Wudu as for prayer…”\xa0 (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 21/343)\xa0\nFor more details, please refer to the following answers: 30784 , 20847 , 14225 , 7310 , and 10319\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20847/can-a-woman-do-household-duties-when-she-is-junub
170174,"All the Abrahamic religions believe in one God and are awaiting their Messiah who is mentioned in their scriptures. So the Christians are awaiting the second coming of Jesus Christ, and the Jews are awaiting the Messiah son of David. As for you Muslims, you are awaiting two people at the same time, the Messiah Jesus son of Mary and the Awaited Mahdi. How can that be? Is it possible that these two figures refer to one man who is unique, meaning that the Mahdi is nothing more than another title for the Messiah son of Mary? If that is not so, then how do you explain that you are waiting for two messiahs at the same time?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe religion that Allah, may He be exalted, sent down is one religion, namely Islam. It is the religion of Noah (Nuh), Abraham (Ibrahim), Moses (Musa) and Jesus (‘Isa), a religion that is based on worshipping God alone with no partner or associate, and believing in all of His Messengers. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Indeed, the religion in the sight of Allah is Islam}\xa0[Al ‘Imran 3:19]\n{And whoever desires other than Islam as religion - never will it be accepted from him, and he, in the Hereafter, will be among the losers}\xa0[Aal ‘Imraan 3:85].\nAnd He tells us that Noah (Nuh – peace be upon him) said:\n{and I have been commanded to be of the Muslims}\xa0[Yoonus 10:72].\nAnd he tells us regarding Abraham (Ibrahim):\n{\xa0Abraham was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but he was one inclining toward truth, a Muslim [submitting to Allah ]. And he was not of the polytheists}\xa0[Al ‘Imran 3:67].\n{[It is] the religion of your father, Abraham. Allah named you “Muslims” before [in former scriptures]\xa0}\xa0[al-Hajj 22:78].\nAnd He says concerning Moses (Musa):\n{And Moses said, “O my people, if you have believed in Allah, then rely upon Him, if you should be Muslims.”}\xa0[Yoonus 10:84].\nAnd He says tells us that Joseph (Yusuf) said:\n{Cause me to die a Muslim and join me with the righteous}\xa0[Yoosuf 12:101].\nBut the deviant Christians drifted away from monotheism and fell into polytheism; they worshipped Jesus and his mother and disbelieved in the final Messenger who was foretold by Jesus (peace be upon him) in the Gospel (Injil).\nSecondly:\nThe Muslims believe that at the end of time, there will be a righteous man whose name is al-Mahdi. He will unite them and lead them, and he will be a precursor to the descent of Jesus son of Mary (peace be upon him). What is so strange about the fact that the Muslims are waiting for two people and not one person? One of them is a righteous man, one of the leaders of the Muslims, namely the Mahdi, and the other is a Prophet, one of the Messengers of strong will, namely Jesus (peace be upon him).\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The three nations are all expecting an awaited one who will emerge at the end of time, for he is promised in each religion. The Muslims are awaiting the descent of the Messiah Jesus son of Mary from heaven, to break the cross, kill the pigs and kill his enemies among the Jews and those among the Christians who worship him. And they are awaiting the emergence of the Mahdi, who will be one of the descendants of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him); he will fill the earth with justice as it was filled with injustice.""(Ighathat al-Lahfan\xa0 2/338).\nAl-Bukhari (2222) and Muslim (155) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “By the One in Whose hand is my soul, soon the Son of Maryam will descend among you as a just ruler, he will break the cross, kill the pigs and abolish the jizyah, and wealth will become so abundant that no one will accept it.”\nIn the hadith of Jaabir ibn ‘Abdillah (may Allah be pleased with him), it says: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: Jesus son of Mary will come down, and their leader the Mahdi will say: ‘Come and lead us in prayer.’ But he will say: ‘No; their leader should be from among them,’ by way of Allah honouring this ummah.”\nNarrated by al-Harith ibn Abi Usamah in his Musnad. Ibn al-Qayyim said in al-Manar al-Munif (1/147): Its isnad is jayyid (good).\nThe origin of this hadith appears in Sahih Muslim without naming the leader, as it says: “… Then ‘Isa ibn Maryam (peace be upon him) will descend and their leader will say: ‘Come and lead us in prayer.’ But he will say: ‘No; their leader should be from among them,’ by way of Allah honouring this ummah.” Narrated by Muslim (225).\nThis indicates that the Mahdi will come before Jesus, and that Jesus (peace be upon him) will pray behind him. Then Jesus (peace be upon him) will become the ruler after he kills the Dajjal, who is the false messiah whom the Jews are awaiting.\nThus the Muslims are awaiting the true Messiah, who was not killed or crucified; the Christians are awaiting the imaginary messiah who was killed, crucified and buried; and the Jews are awaiting the false messiah, the Dajjal, whom Allah will cause to be killed at the hand of Jesus son of Mary (peace be upon him).\nThe Sunnah also indicates that that the people of Gog and Magog (Ya’juj and Ma’juj) will be destroyed in answer to the prayer of Jesus (peace be upon him); thus the earth will be cleansed of the polytheists and disbelievers, and there will be no one left except the monotheists and believers.\nIn Sahih Muslim (2937), after mention of the tribulation of the Dajjal, it says: “Then whilst he is like that, Allah will send the Messiah son of Maryam, who will descend to the white minaret in the east of Damascus, wearing two garments lightly perfumed with saffron, placing his hands on the wings of two angels. When he lowers his head drops of water will come quickly from it and when he raises it, slow drops like pearls will fall. Every disbeliever whom his breath reaches will die, and his breath will reach as far as he can see. He will pursue him [the Dajjal] until he catches up with him at the gate of Ludd (Lod), and kills him. Then some people whom Allah has protected will come to ‘Isa ibn Maryam, and he will wipe their faces and inform them of their ranks in Paradise. Whilst they are like that, Allah will reveal to ‘Isa: I have brought forth some slaves of Mine against whom no one will be able to fight; take My slaves to safety in at-Toor [Sinai]. And Allah will send Ya’juj and Ma’juj, who will swarm down from every slope. The first of them will pass by the Lake of Tiberias and will drink what is in it, and the last of them will pass it and say: There was once water here. Then the Prophet of Allah ‘Isa and his companions will be besieged until the head of the bull of one of them will be better than one hundred dinars for one of you today. The Prophet of Allah ‘Isa and his companions will beseech [Allah], and Allah will send worms in their necks, and they will all perish as one in the morning. Then the Prophet of Allah ‘Isa and his companions will come down to the earth and they will not find a spot the size of a handspan on earth that is not filled with their putrefaction and stench. The Prophet of Allah ‘Isa (A) and his companions will beseech Allah, and Allah will send birds like the necks of Bactrian camels which will carry them and throw them wherever Allah wills. Then Allah will send rain which will not be kept out by any house of clay or hair; it will wash the earth and leave it like a mirror. Then it will be said to the earth: Bring forth your fruits and restore your blessing. On that day a group of people will eat from a pomegranate and shelter beneath its skin. Milk will be blessed until a milch-camel will be sufficient for a multitude of people, and a milch-cow will be sufficient for a tribe of people, and a milch-sheep will be sufficient for a clan of people. Then whilst they are like that, Allah will send a pleasant wind which will cause them pain beneath their armpits and will take the soul of every believer and every Muslim. The most evil of people will be left and they will fornicate like donkeys, and upon them the Hour will come.”\nFor a description of the Mahdi please see the answer to question no. 2937.\nThirdly:\nWhat is more important than finding out about the future is rectifying the present, by learning about the true religion and following it.\nWe believe that the true religion is Islam; it is a religion that does not differentiate between the Messengers or exaggerate about any one of them. If you become Muslim, you will believe in Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad. It is a religion that is based on sound human nature. Three cannot be one, and the true religion of Islam cannot attribute bad things to God the Creator or to the best of His Prophets, as the Jews do.\nThe evidence for the soundness of Islam is uncountable. In the Bible – despite its distortion – there is a great deal of evidence for that. For more information, please see the answers to questions no. 44018 and 101572 .\nWe advise you to do two things:\nFirstly: turn to your Creator and ask Him to guide you to the true religion, open your heart to guidance and show you the path of salvation.\nSecondly: read the Holy Quran and try to learn about Islam and what it calls people to. Try to be unbiased, like one who is seeking the truth and striving for it.\nFor our part, we ask Allah, may He be exalted, to open your heart, illuminate your path, guide you to Him, show you the path that leads to Him, choose for you His religion and make you one of the pious who are blessed in this world and the hereafter.\nWe would be happy to correspond with you and answer your questions.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/170174/are-the-muslims-awaiting-the-mahdi-or-the-messiah
25803,"If my pet cat walks in front of me or sits in front of me while I'm praying, what must I do? Should I carry on or cut off and keep it away?","['Praise be to Allah.What invalidates prayer if it passes in front of you?\nPrayer is invalidated if one of three things mentioned by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) walks in front of the worshipper . He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Prayer is invalidated by a woman, a donkey or a dog ; that may be prevented by something equal in height to the back of a saddle [placed in front of the worshipper as a sutrah or screen].” (Narrated by Muslim, 511)\xa0\nAccording to one report, “a black dog.” The narrator said: “I said, ‘O Abu Dharr, what is the difference between a black dog and a red or yellow dog?’ He said, ‘O son of my brother, I asked the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) the same question, and he said, “The black dog is a devil.”’” (Narrated by Muslim, 510)\xa0\nThis ruling applies if one of the things mentioned passes in front of the worshipper and he does not have a Sutrah or object to serve as a screen in front of him. But if he has a screen in front of him and the person or animal passes beyond that Sutrah, then his prayer is not affected, because of the Hadith of Abu Juhayfah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: “I heard my father narrating that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) led them in prayer in Al-Bat-ha’, and in front of them was an ‘Anzah (a short spear, iron-tipped at its lower end). He prayed two Rak`ahs for Dhuhr followed by two Rak`ahs for `Asr, and a woman and a donkey passed in front of him.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 495)\nThis ruling applies to the Imam and to one who is praying alone; with regard to the members of a congregation praying behind an Imam, the Sutrah of the Imam is also a Sutrah for them. Please refer to question no.\xa03404 .\xa0\nDo cats invalidate prayer if they pass in front of you?\nAs for cats , they do not invalidate the prayer even if they pass in front of you, because the basic guideline is that the prayer is valid, and there is no evidence to suggest that cats can invalidate the prayer.\xa0\nBut the worshipper should try hard to ensure that nothing passes in front of him. `Amr ibn Shu’ayb narrated from his father that his grandfather said: “We stopped with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in Thaniyyat Adhakhir and the time for prayer came, so he prayed facing a wall which lay in the direction of the Qiblah, and we were behind him. A lamb came and tried to pass in front of him and he kept pushing it back until its belly was pushed up against the wall, then it passed behind him.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 708; Al-Albani classed it as sound in Sahih Abu Dawud, 652)\xa0\nAre cats pure?\nCats are pure , and based on that, if a cat drinks from a vessel of water, the vessel does not become impure, because of the Hadith of Kabshah bint Ka’b ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with her), who was the wife of Abu Qatadah’s son, she said: “Abu Qatadah came in and I poured water for him to do Wudu. A cat came and drank some of the water so he tilted the vessel to let it drink. He saw me looking at him and said, ‘Do you find it strange, O daughter of my brother?’ I said, ‘Yes.’ He said, ‘The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said that they are not impure, rather they are among those who go around amongst you.’” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 92; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Tirmidhi)\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/25803/do-cats-invalidate-the-prayer-if-they-pass-in-front-of-you
