118432,"I work as an accountant in a shipping company. Recently I found out that the company for which I work gives bribes to some workers to clear some shipments (get them released from the customs) and the like. I work as an accountant in this company, and I give this money to the manager, so that he can give it to the workers as bribes, and I have found out about this. Is there any sin on me? What should I do in this case?","['Praise be to Allah.Is bribery prohibited?\nIt is not permissible to deal with bribes , either accepting them or giving them. This is a major sin, because of the report narrated by Ahmad (6791) and Abu Dawood (3580) (may Allah have mercy on them) from `Abdullah ibn `Amr (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) cursed the one who gives a bribe and the one who takes it. (Classed as authentic by Al-Albaani in\xa0Irwa’ al-Ghalil,\xa02621)\nWhen is it allowed to give bribes in Islam?\nThere are exceptions to original ruling, as follows:\n\nIf the person who has a right to something cannot take what is lawfully his except by paying a bribe , then the scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) stated that it is permissible for him to give the bribe in that case , and the prohibition applies to the one who takes it, not the one who gives it.\xa0\n\nSo if clearing the shipment can only be done by paying money, or if not paying money will result in delay in releasing the shipment and will be detrimental to the one who has the right, it is permissible to pay the money in that case, and the prohibition applies to the one who takes it.\n\nPaying money to remove or alleviate wrongdoing, there is nothing wrong with that.\nGiving the money to a worker or office to go to the official bodies and do what is needed to clear the transaction. There is nothing wrong with this, and it does not come under the heading of a bribery; rather this comes under the heading of hiring someone to do a task.\n\nIs the accountant blamed for giving the bribe money to the manager?\nIf what the manager receives comes under the headings mentioned above, there is no blame on you for giving this money to him and recording that, and the like.\nBut if you have found out that it is a bribe that is given to clear things that are prohibited, or it is paid while it is possible to clear the transactions without it, without any delay that is detrimental to the company’s interests, or other matters that do not come under the headings of the things mentioned above that make it permissible, then it is not permissible for you to help in giving that money to him or recording it, because Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And cooperate in righteousness and piety, but do not cooperate in sin and transgression. And fear Allah; indeed, Allah is severe in penalty.}\xa0[Al-Ma’idah 5:2]\nYou should advise your manager and explain to him that bribes are prohibited for the giver and the taker, and that it is prohibited to help in that.\nYou should understand that whoever fears Allah, may He be Exalted, He will protect him and suffice him; whoever adheres to His commands, He will grant him more of His bounty. So do not let fear of people prevent you from speaking the truth when you know it.\nImam Ahmad (11030), At-Tirmidhi (2191) and Ibn Majah (4007) (may Allah have mercy on them) narrated from Abu Sa‘id Al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) stood up to deliver a khutbah (sermon), and one of the things that he said was: “Indeed, fear of people should not prevent a man from speaking the truth, if he knows it.” This Hadith was classed as authentic by Al-Albaani in\xa0Sahih Ibn Majah.\nMay Allah help us and you to do that which He loves and is pleased with.\nFor more details, please see this category: Bribes\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/118432/what-is-considered-bribery-in-islam

101023,How can I acquire good characteristics?,"[""Praise be to Allah.Importance of good character in Islam\xa0\nA good attitude is the characteristic of the best of the messengers and is the best action of the righteous. It is – no doubt – half of religion, the fruit of the efforts of the pious and the practice of the devoted worshipper. Bad characteristics are lethal poison and lead to shameful consequences.\xa0\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I have only been sent to perfect good characteristics.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari in al-Adab al-Mufrad (273) and classed as sahih by al-Albani in As-Silsilah As-Sahihah, 45)\xa0\nAbu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was asked about that which will admit most people to Paradise. He said: “Fear of Allah and a good attitude.”\xa0(Narrated by At-Tirmidhi (2004); he said it is sahih gharib. It was classed as sahih by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Tirmidhi.)\xa0\nHence Islam paid a great deal of attention to laying down guidelines for treating diseases of the heart (i.e., spiritual diseases) and ways of acquiring good characteristics, which is regarded as one of the most important duties, because no heart will be free of sicknesses. If the heart is neglected, sicknesses will accumulate. No soul is free of inclinations which, if they are given free rein, will lead it to doom in this world and in the Hereafter.\xa0\nThis kind of medicine requires profound knowledge of reasons and causes, then it needs hard work to remedy it and set things straight, in order to reach a successful outcome. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Indeed he succeeds who purifies his own self.”\xa0[Al-Shams 91:9]\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to pray for a good attitude, saying, “O Allah, You have made my outward form beautiful so make my attitude good too.” Narrated by Ibn Hibban in his Sahih (3/239) and classed as sahih by Al-Albani in Irwa’ Al-Ghalil (75).\xa0\nHow to know your own faults\nIf a person knows what his shortcomings are he can do something to remedy them, but many people are unaware of their faults and shortcomings. A person may see the speck in his brother’s eye and not see the log in his own. The person who wants to know what his own faults are may do four things:\xa0\n\nHe may sit before a Shaykh who has insight into people’s faults and knowledge of the subtlety of some problems and learn from him knowledge, good attitudes and manners.\nHe may ask a sincere friend who has insight and is religiously committed to keep watch over him and take note of his actions, so that he can draw attention to whatever he dislikes of his attitude, actions, and inward and outward faults. This is what the best and greatest imams of Islam used to do. ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) used to say: “May Allah have mercy on a man who shows me my shortcomings.”\nHe can learn about his faults and shortcomings from the lips of his enemies, because the eye of one who is resentful will always notice bad things about you. A man may benefit more from an enemy who wants to cause trouble and mentions his faults than from a friend who wants to flatter him by praising him and concealing his faults.\nHe can mix with people. Everything that he sees as blameworthy among people, he should guard against in his own self, because the believer is the mirror of his fellow believer, and in the faults of others he can see his own faults. It was said to ‘Isa (peace be upon him): “Who taught you?” He said: “No one taught me; I saw the ignorance of the ignorant as something bad and I avoided it.”\n\nHow to develop good character\nAttitude reflects how a person thinks and the way he is inside. Just as, in general, a person’s outward form cannot be beautiful if only the eyes are beautiful and not the nose, mouth and cheek, and everything must be beautiful in order for the entire outward form to be beautiful, so too there are four requirements of inward beauty which must all be met in order for one’s attitude to be good or beautiful. If all four requirements are met and balanced then a good attitude is acquired, the characteristics of which are: strong knowledge, control of anger, control of desire, and a proper balance between these three aspects.\xa0\n\nWith regard to strong knowledge, good and sound knowledge means understanding in such a way that one can see the difference between telling the truth and telling lies in speech, between truth and falsehood in beliefs, between beauty and ugliness in actions. If this strength becomes sound, there will result from it wisdom, and wisdom is the head of a good attitude .\xa0\nWith regard to strength of anger, its beauty is that it is used in accordance with what is dictated by wisdom.\xa0\nThe same applies to desire; its beauty and strength should be controlled by wisdom, meaning under the control of reason and Shari`ah.\xa0\nWith regard to balance, it means proper control of desires and anger, under the control of wisdom and Shari`ah.\xa0\n\nReason is like a sincere adviser. Justice and balance is power, and it is like one who does what is dictated by reason. Anger is to be subjected to control.\xa0\n\xa0The one who acquires and balances these characteristics is a man of good character in general, and from it stem all good qualities.\xa0\nNo one achieved perfect balance of these four characteristics except the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him); people after him vary in how close or distant they are to him in character. Everyone who is close to him in these characteristics is close to Allah, to the extent that he is close to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him).\xa0\nHow to achieve perfect balance of these four characteristics\nThis balance may be achieved in two ways:\xa0\n\nBy the blessing of Allah, as part of one's inherent nature\xa0\nBy acquiring these characteristics through effort and training, i.e., pushing oneself to do the actions dictated by the desired characteristic.\xa0\n\nThe Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Knowledge is acquired by seeking it, and patience is acquired by striving to be patient. The one who strives to attain good will be given it, and the one who strives to protect himself from evil will be protected. (Narrated by al-Khatib and others from the hadith of Abu Ad-Darda’; classed as hasan by Al-Albani.)\xa0\n\nIf a person wants to attain the characteristic of generosity, the way to attain that is by pushing himself to do the actions of one who is generous, which is giving away wealth. So he keeps pushing himself and persisting in that, striving against his own inclinations, until that becomes second nature and it becomes easy for him, thus he becomes generous.\xa0\nSimilarly, if a person wants to attain the characteristic of humility, when he is inclined to be arrogant, the way he does it is by persisting in doing the actions of the humble for a long time, striving and pushing himself until that becomes one of his characteristics, and it becomes second nature to him and easy for him.\xa0\n\nAll praiseworthy characteristics that are prescribed in Islam may be acquired in this way. Religious characteristics will never become entrenched in the soul unless the soul gets accustomed to doing all good habits, unless it gives up all bad habits, and unless it persists in doing good deeds like one who loves good deeds and enjoys doing them, and hates bad deeds and is pained by them. \xa0\nThis may be explained by means of examples:\xa0\n\nThe one who wants to become proficient in writing, so that this becomes one of his characteristics and writing beautifully becomes second nature to him, has no other way but to hold in his hand that which the proficient writer holds, and persist for a long time, trying to imitate beautiful hand writing, and keep on doing so until it becomes well established in him, then finally beautiful writing will become second nature to him.\xa0\nSimilarly, if a person wants to become a faqih, he has no choice but to do what the fuqaha’ do, which is to keep studying issues of fiqh until his heart develops a love of the subject.\xa0\nAnd if a person wants to become generous and refrain from asking people, and become patient and humble, he has to keep on doing the actions of those people until they become second nature to him. He should not despair of attaining those characteristics if he fails to study for one night, for he will not be able to attain it with one night’s study. Perfecting the soul and adorning it with good deeds will not be attained by worshipping for one day, and he will not be deprived of it if he sins for one day. But slacking off for one day may lead to another day, then slowly one becomes accustomed to laziness.\xa0\n\nHow to treat your body to rid it of bad characteristics\xa0\nThe likeness of the soul and the way to treat it to rid it of bad characteristics and make it attain good characteristics is that of the body, when treating it to rid it of disease and bring it good health.\xa0\nAlthough the humours are usually in balance, the stomach may become sick due to food, drink or circumstances. Similarly, everyone is born with a balanced nature, but his parents make him a Jew, Christian or Magian, i.e., by training and teaching one acquires bad characteristics. \xa0\nJust as the body is not created perfect in the first place, rather it is made perfect by rearing and food, similarly the soul is also created imperfect but with the potential to become perfect, and it can only be perfected by means of education, discipline and nourishment with knowledge. If the body is sound, the doctor’s role is to show one the way to maintain good health; if it is sick, then the doctor’s job is to restore health. The same applies to the soul; if it is pure and sound then one should strive to preserve it and bring it more strength and acquire more good characteristics; if it is imperfect then one should strive to perfect it and purify it.\xa0\nSickness that causes imbalance in the body can only be treated by its opposite, so if it is caused by cold it is treated with heat and vice versa. Similarly, bad characteristics, which are diseases of the heart, are treated by applying the opposite.\xa0 So the remedy for the disease of ignorance is seeking knowledge, and the remedy for the disease of miserliness is pushing oneself to be generous, and the remedy for the disease of arrogance is pushing oneself to be humble, and the remedy for the sickness of eating too much is imposing self restraint.\xa0\nJust as it is essential to put up with the bitterness of the remedy and show patience in refraining from what one desires when treating physical sickness, so too it is essential to put up with the bitterness of striving and being patient when treating diseases of the heart; rather it is more important, because one gets rid of physical sickness when one dies, but the sicknesses of the heart – Allah forbid – may persist after death and continue forever and ever.\xa0\nThese examples show you the way to treat diseases of the heart, and demonstrate that the holistic way is to treat them with the opposite of whatever one is inclined towards and likes. Allah has summed up all of that in His Noble Book, when He said (interpretation of the meaning):\n“But as for him who feared standing before his Lord, and restrained himself from impure evil desires and lusts. \xa0Verily, Paradise will be his abode.”\xa0[An-Nazi’at 79:40-41]\xa0\nHow to fulfill what you resolve to do\nWhat matters with regard to striving is fulfilling what one resolves to do. If a person resolves to give up a desire, then he must show patience and persist, because if he gets used to giving up what he resolved to do, that will lead to corruption. If it so happens that he falls short of what he resolved to do, then he must impose some punishment on himself because of that, because if he does not scare himself with that punishment, his evil inclinations will overwhelm him and he will be attracted to indulging in desires, and all his efforts will be spoiled.\xa0\nReference:\xa0\nSummarized and adapted from Ihya’ ‘Ulum Ad-Din by al-Ghazali (3/62-98).\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/101023/how-to-acquire-good-characteristics-in-islam
12720,What is the ruling if some drops of urine get in the under pants while urinating normally or in a hurry.,"['Praise be to Allah.The obligation of removing impurity\nThe Muslim must beware of impurity and try to avoid it as much as he can. Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) passed by two graves and said, “They are being punished, but they are not being punished for something that was difficult to avoid. One of them used to walk about spreading malicious gossip, and the other used not to take care to avoid getting urine on himself.” (Narrated by Muslim, At-Taharah, 439)\xa0\nWhat is meant is that he did not take precautions to avoid getting it on himself. Hence it is permissible to urinate standing up so long as a person can be sure that he will not get splashes of urine on his clothes or his body.\xa0\nSecondly, with regard to the points raised in the question:\xa0\nIs Ghusl required if Najasah gets on your clothes?\nIf Najasah gets onto a person’s clothes, he does not have to do Ghusl, because Najasah is not one of the things that invalidate Wudu’ or Ghusl . Rather Ghusl is required in the case of major impurity and Wudu’ is required in the case of minor impurity. But what he has to do in this case is to remove the Najasah.\xa0\nWe are commanded to remove impurity from our clothes because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And purify your garments.” [Al-Muddaththir 74:4]\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, concerning menstrual blood that gets on the clothes, “Take hold of the soiled place, rub it and put it in water and rub it in order to remove the traces of blood and then pour water over it. Then pray in it.”\xa0\nIf Najasah gets onto something that can be wrung out, then this is what must be done.\xa0\nHow to remove impurity\nRemoving the impurity may be done by washing it until the traces of the impurity have\xa0disappeared. So if the Najasah gets onto his clothes, he only has to wash the part of the garment where the impurity is, and he does not have to wash the rest of it. Also, he does not have to change his clothes, but if he wants to change his clothes, there is nothing wrong with him doing that.\xa0\nCan you pray in a garment that has some impurity?\xa0\nWith regard to the ruling on praying in a garment on which there is some impurity , it should be noted that being pure and free from Najasah is a condition of the prayer being valid, and if a person is not free from impurity then his prayer is invalid, because he prayed when he was contaminated with this impurity. So if he prays when he is contaminated with impurity then he has prayed in a manner that is not enjoined by Allah and His Messenger. It was narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does an action that is not part of this matter of ours (i.e., Islam), will have it rejected.”\xa0\nWhen impurities get onto clothes, one of the following scenarios must apply:\xa0\n\nWhen a person is certain that impurity has gotten onto a particular part of his garment, in which case he must wash the area where the impurity is.\nWhen he thinks it most likely that the impurity is on a particular part of the garment.\nWhen a person thinks that there may be some impurity in some part of the garment. In the second and third cases, he should make a decision, and whatever part of the garment he thinks is affected by the Najasah, he must wash it. (See Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti’ by Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 2/221)\xa0\n\nRuling on a small amount of impurity\nSome of the scholars said that a small amount of impurity cannot be overlooked at all. \xa0\nHowever, some of them said that a small amount of all types of impurity may be overlooked. This is the view of Abu Hanifah and was the view favoured by Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah, especially with regard to problems that many people face, because it is too difficult to be thorough and to clean it properly all the time. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“and [Allah] has not laid upon you in religion any hardship.” [Al-Hajj 22:78]\nThe correct view is the view of Abu Hanifah and Ibn Taymiyyah. Among the small amounts of impurity that may be overlooked because it is too difficult to guard against it is a small amount of urine in the case of one who suffers from incontinence but tries to guard against it as much as he can.\xa0(See Ash-Sharh al-Mumti’ by Ibn ‘Uthaymien, 1/382)\xa0\nWith regard to what constitutes a small amount, whatever ordinary people consider to be a lot is a lot, and whatever they consider to be a little is a little. \xa0\nOn this basis, it may be said that the basic principle is that if a few drops of urine get on a person’s garment and he washes off whatever got on it, until he thinks it most likely that the Najasah has disappeared, then whatever is left and is not washed comes under the heading of the small amount of Najasah that may be overlooked, as stated above. And Allah knows best.\xa0\nRuling on not being aware of impurity\nShaykh Ibn Baz was asked about the case of one who is unaware of the Najasah . He said:\xa0\nIf he does not find out that it is impure until after he has finished praying, then his prayer is valid, because when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was told by Jibril while he was praying that there was something impure on his shoe, he did not repeat the first part of his prayer. The same applies if he knows about it (i.e., the impurity) before he prays, then he forgets and prays wearing (the garment with the impurity), and does not remember until after he has finished praying, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Our Lord! Punish us not if we forget or fall into error.” [Al-Baqarah 2: 286]\nBut if he has some doubts while praying as to whether there is some impurity on his clothes, it is not permissible for him to stop praying, whether he is leading the prayers or is praying alone; he must complete his prayer.\xa0(Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 12/396-397)\xa0\nDoubts about impurity\nThe issue of not being sure whether the impurity has been removed: if he gets some impurity on his clothes then this is the certain fact and this certainty will remain until the impurity is removed. Then if he is not sure whether he has removed the impurity or not, he should go by that which is certain, which is that he has not yet removed the impurity. The converse also applies, if he is certain that his clothes are pure, then he becomes unsure whether something impure got onto them or not, he should go by that which is certain, which is that his clothes are pure because that is what he is certain of.\xa0\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said:\xa0\n“With regard to a person’s clothes, the basic principle is that they are pure so long as he is not certain that some impurity has gotten onto his body or clothes. This basic principle is supported by what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said when a man complained to him that something happened to him during his prayer – i.e., he invalidated his Wudu’. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to him: “Do not stop praying unless you hear a sound or detect a smell.” If a person is not sure about it, then the basic principle is that he is pure. A person may think it is more likely that his clothes have become contaminated with Najasah but so long as he is not certain, the basic principle is that they remain pure.” (Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 11/107)\xa0\nThe only thing that is not permissible if a person has Najasah on his clothes is prayer, even if he has not invalidated his Wudu’. Other actions such as reading the Quran etc. are not prohibited.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12720/can-you-pray-with-urine-on-clothes
