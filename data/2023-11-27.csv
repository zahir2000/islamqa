131561,What is the ruling on what some people do of signing books and writing good wishes to those who ask them to do that?,"['Praise be to Allah.We put this question to Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahman al-Barrak (may Allah preserve him) and he said:\nWhat some authors do of signing copies of the books they have written at the request of the publishers, is a new phenomenon and is undoubtedly a foreign tradition that does not make sense, because the copies that the author is meant to sign are not gifts from the author that he would sign to indicate that. Rather the copy of the book belongs to the one who is requesting the signature, so it does not seem that there is any meaning in that except blind imitation. It is as if the ones who do that are seeking blessing (barakah) from the author writing his name in their copy, and that is very unlikely, unless the author is someone whom the Sufis believe in as they believe in their saints. What appears to be the case is that this is not requested from every author; rather it is requested from those who are famous, so that the one who gets his signature can boast about it, or the author is someone he likes, so he gets that signature for the sake of memory. It is well known that competing in seeking signatures from the author may lead to him developing self-admiration.\nBased on the above, the least we can say is that doing this is makruh, because it is imitating non-Muslims, and because it makes no sense and it may cause the author to develop self-admiration. It may also lead to the one who asks for the signature venerating the author and the copy that he signed. And Allah knows best. End quote.\nMoreover, competition among fans, male and female, to rush to the author to get his or her signature, as happens in book fairs, may also open the door to fitnah and temptation between the sexes.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/131561/ruling-on-asking-authors-to-sign-their-books
245973,"I have a very bad character; I am disobedient and defiant towards my mother and I often make her angry. Sometimes my manners and character are good, but most of the time they are bad. How can I improve my character and my manners? What are the things that will help me to be kind to my parents and develop a good character? Will I be punished if my character and manners are bad? Or is having a good character something that is only good but is not essential? When my character is good, I feel that I am showing off, and I feel that I am committing minor shirk (by showing off). So how can I remain steadfast in having a good character and good manners, whilst being sincere to Allah in that regard?","['Praise be to Allah.Virtue of a good charecter in Islam\nA good character is something that will weigh most heavily in the balance of deeds on the Day of Resurrection, and the best of people in character will be seated closest to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on the Day of Resurrection.\nIt was narrated by At-Tirmidhi (2018) – who classed it as sound – from Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Among the dearest of you to me and those who will be seated closest to me on the Day of Resurrection are those of you who are best in character .” (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Saheeh At-Tirmidhi)\nAl-Bukhari (6035) and Muslim (2321) narrated from ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that he said: “The best of you are the best of you in character.”\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“This is encouragement to have a good character, and it highlights the virtue of such a person, for this is the character of the Prophets of Allah, may He be exalted, and His close friends (Awliya’).”\nAl-Hasan Al-Basri (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“The definition of a good character is doing acts of kindness, refraining from causing harm, and having a cheerful countenance.”\nAl-Qadi ‘Iyad (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“It means mixing with people with a kind and cheerful character, and being friendly and compassionate towards them, putting up with them, showing forbearance and patience towards them at times of hardship, refraining from being arrogant towards them or mistreating them, and avoiding being harsh and angry with them or being critical towards them.”\nIs it a sin to disobey your parents?\nDefiance and disobedience towards parents is a major sin , and the one who is defiantly disobedient towards his parents will not prosper in this world or in the hereafter.\nWhat the Muslim, man or woman, must do is treat his parents very kindly and strive to treat them well in every way possible, and to avoid angering them or going against their wishes and defiantly disobeying them.\nHow to improve your character in Islam\nIt is possible to improve one’s character and refine it, by doing the following:\n\nKnowing the virtues of having a good character and the reward that will result from it in this world and the hereafter.\nKnowing the bad consequences of having a bad character, and what will result from it of requital and negative consequences.\nStudying the biographies of the earlier generations (Salaf) and the lives of the righteous.\nAvoiding getting angry, striving to attain patience, and training oneself to be deliberate and not hasty.\nSitting with people of good character, and avoiding sitting with people of bad character.\nTraining oneself to develop a good character and trying to make oneself become accustomed to that, and being patient when striving to do that.\nFinally: calling upon Allah, may He be Exalted, and asking Him to make your character good and help you to attain that. One of the supplications of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was: “O Allah, You have made my outward appearance good, so make my character good.” Narrated by Ahmad (24392); classed as authentic by the commentators on Al-Musnad. Also classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Al-Jami‘ (1307).\n\nIf a Muslim slips and behaves badly in some situation, he should hasten to apologise and set things straight, and he should resolve to improve his character.\nWhen the Muslim strives to improve his character, doing that in obedience to the command of Allah, may He be exalted, seeking His pleasure and following the example of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), this is like any other act of worship (that is, he should be sincere in his intention and so on). So he should not try to improve his character in order that people might praise him, because this will cancel out the reward and he will be deserving of punishment for showing off.\nJust as the Muslim should strive to make all his worship sincerely for Allah alone, so too he should strive to do the same when trying to improve his character. He should always bear in mind the command of Allah, the reckoning, the balance, and paradise and hell, and he should remember that people will never benefit him or harm him at all. Remembering the hereafter is one of the most important means that will help the Muslim to be sincere to Allah, may He be exalted.\nHow to be dutiful to parents in Islam?\nThings that will help one to treat parents kindly include the following:\n\nKnowing the rights and virtues of parents, and how they brought up their children and put up with hardship in order to give their children a life of ease and joy.\nKnowing the Islamic texts that encourage showing kindness to parents , and the texts that warn against defiantly disobeying them, and understanding the effect that it may have and the punishment for it in this world and the hereafter.\nKnowing that showing kindness to parents is one of the greatest means of ensuring that the one who shows kindness to his parents will have children who will show kindness to him, and that defiantly disobeying parents is one of the greatest means of ensuring that the one who defiantly disobeys his parents will have children who will be defiantly disobedient towards him.\nStudying the biographies of the earlier generations (the Salaf) and learning how they used to honour their fathers and mothers.\nReading books and essays that speak about showing kindness to parents or defiantly disobeying them, and also listening to Islamic lessons that speak about these topics.\nGifting them, saying kind words, being cheerful, offering a great deal of supplication and speaking well to them are among the greatest means that help one to show kindness to parents.\n\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/245973/how-to-improve-your-character-in-islam
174681,There is a hadith which says that young people are sparks of fire; either they pave the way or they burn it. I hope you can explain how sound this hadith is.,"['Praise be to Allah.We have not come across this hadith with this text, or even something close in meaning. It is strange that this hadith is narrated on some English-language Islamic websites and attributed to “al-Tirmidhi.” We do not know who is meant by that: is it Abu ‘Isa al-Tirmidhi, the author of al-Sunan (d. 279 AH), or al-Hakim al-Tirmidhi (d. 320 AH), the author of Nawadir al-Usul? Whatever the case, we did not find this hadith in either of their books. What is required of the Muslim is to verify a report before narrating it, and it is not permissible for him to attribute hadiths to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) before checking whether they are authentic.\nAs for the impact that youth have on the life of communities, it is great and important, because they are the foundation and basis on which the community is built, and they are the main players in different aspects of life, the ones who lead society to progress or regress. We ask Allah to guide the Muslim youth to be torches of light, guidance, success and prosperity.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/174681/young-people-are-sparks-of-fire-is-not-a-hadith
240287,The individual should keep his intention in mind and correct it before doing any deed; how can he do that? What are the standards and guidelines to know whether what you are doing is correct and sincerely for the sake of Allah alone?,"['Praise be to Allah.Correcting one’s intention\xa0\nCorrecting one’s intention , and bearing it in mind when starting to do the deed, is one of the most important things a Muslim should focus on, for the acceptance or rejection of one’s deeds is based on that, as is the soundness or corruption of the heart.\nThe one who wants to form a sound intention for his deeds must pay attention to the motive that is prompting him to do that deed, and he should be keen to ensure that his motive is seeking the pleasure of Allah , may He be Exalted, and obeying Him and complying with His commands.\nBy doing that, his intention will be for Allah. After that, he must maintain this original motive for doing the deed that is sincerely for the sake of Allah. He should not be distracted from that whilst doing the deed, and ensure that his heart and his intention do not change, or become diverted to something other than Allah, or associate anything else with his intention.\nHow to achieve sincerity in your deeds\nOne can find out whether he is being sincere in his deed, and whether he is striving only for the sake of Allah, by paying attention to the following:\n\nHe should not do that deed so that other people can see him or hear about him .\n\nAl-Bukhari (6499) and Muslim (2987) narrated that Jundub (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever talks about his good deeds (to show off), Allah will expose him (on the Day of Resurrection), and whoever makes a (hypocritical) display, Allah will make a display of him.”\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Al-Khattabi said: What this means is that whoever does a deed that is not sincere (for the sake of Allah), rather he wants people to see him and to hear about him, will be recompensed for that by Allah exposing and disgracing him, and will make known what he used to conceal.\nAnd it was said: whoever intends by his deed to seek high status among people, and does not intend it for the sake of Allah, Allah will cause him to be talked about among those with whom he sought to attain high status, but there will be no reward for him in the hereafter."" (Fath Al-Bari 11/336)\nAl-‘Izz ibn ‘Abd As-Salam (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Exceptions from the recommendation to conceal one’s good deeds include: one who does his good deed openly so that his example may be followed, or so that people may benefit from it, such as writing books of knowledge."" (Fath Al-Bari\xa0 11/337).\n\nHe should not concern himself with people’s praise or criticism.\n\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n‘When a person reaches a high level of devotion to his Lord and becomes steadfast in that, he will rise above being concerned with people’s praise and criticism, and he will not rejoice when people praise him or be upset when they criticise him. This is the description of one who is not swayed by his whims and desires and has attained true servitude to his Lord, and whose heart has tasted the sweetness of faith and certainty."" (Madarij As-Salikin\xa0 2/8)\n\nConcealing his good deeds and keeping them secret should be dearer to him than doing them openly.\n\nIt was narrated that ‘Asim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “When Abu Wa’il prayed in his house, he would sob greatly and he would not do that in a place where people could see him, even if he were to be offered the entire world in return for anyone seeing what he did.”\nNarrated by Ahmad in Az-Zuhd (p. 290).\n\nHe should be keen to avoid situations where he could become prominent and famous, unless that serves a legitimate Shar`i interest.\n\nIbrahim ibn Adham (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “He is not sincere towards Allah who wants to become famous."" (Ihya’ ‘Ulum Ad-Din\xa0 3/297).\n\nHe should not increase his good deeds and make them perform them in a better manner when people are around him.\n\nIt was said that sincerity means that a person’s deeds are the same whether they are done openly or privately.\nShowing off occurs when the deeds one does openly are better than those that are done privately.""(Madarij As-Salikin\xa0 2/91).\n\nHe should always think of himself as falling short, and should not attribute any good deeds to himself, and he should realise that all blessings come from Allah, and were it not for Allah, may He be Exalted, he would be doomed.\n\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And if not for the favour of Allah upon you and His mercy, not one of you would have been pure, ever, but Allah purifies whom He wills”\xa0[An-Nur 24:21]\n\nHe should pray a great deal for forgiveness (Istighfar ) after doing the deed, and should feel that he has fallen short.\n\nAs-Sa‘di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n‘Every time a person finishes an act of worship, he should seek Allah’s forgiveness for his shortcomings, and thank Him for enabling him to do it. He should not be like one who thinks that he has perfected his acts of worship and done a favour to his Lord, and think that it has given him a high status, for such a person deserves rejected and for his deed not to be accepted, just as the former deserves to be accepted and enabled to do more deeds."" (Tafsir As-Sa‘di\xa0 p. 92)\n\nHe should rejoice when Allah enables him to do righteous deeds.\n\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Say, in the bounty of Allah and in His mercy - in that let them rejoice; it is better than what they accumulate”\xa0[Yunus 10:58]\nIf a person pays attention to these matters with regard to his deeds, then there is the hope that he will be one of the sincere.\nCan you be certain that you are sincere in your deeds?\nAs for being certain that one is sincere in his deeds, there is no way to verify that, because the knowledge of that is with Allah alone. But the individual should take measures to attain sincerity, and ask Allah, may He be Exalted, to enable him to do his deeds in an appropriate and sincere manner, but he should not affirm that he or anyone else has attained sincerity.\nFor more details, please see this category: Sincerity\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/240287/how-to-achieve-sincerity-in-your-deeds-in-islam
