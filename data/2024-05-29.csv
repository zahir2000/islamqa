315882,"By Allah’s leave, I intend to do Hajj. Is it permissible for me to wear a face mask instead of niqab, because my eyesight is weak and I want to be able to see clearly?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe woman in ihram is not allowed to wear anything that is tailored to fit her face, such as the niqab, burqa‘ and litham [types of face veils], because of the report narrated by al-Bukhari (1838) from ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: A man stood up and said: O Messenger of Allah, what garments do you instruct us to wear in ihram?\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not wear a chemise, or trousers, or a turban, or a burnoose, except for one who does not have sandals, in which case he may wear khuffs (leather slippers that come above the ankle), but let him cut them so that they come lower than the ankles. And do not wear anything that has been dyed with saffron or safflower, and the woman in ihram should not wear a niqab or gloves.”\nThe jurists disallowed wearing a burqa‘, and some of them disallowed wearing a litham, because they are face veils (niqab) or come under the same ruling as face veils.\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: … The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “A woman should not wear a niqab or gloves” meaning in ihram. So her hands and face are equal with regard to the prohibition on wearing what has been made to fit the shape of any part of the body.\nThe correct view is that anything that comes under the general meaning of the wording of the hadith and the same reason for prohibition is also prohibited. Although the burqa‘ and litham are not called niqab, there is no difference between them and niqab. Rather if the niqab is prohibited [in ihram], then it is more appropriate that the burqa‘ and litham should also be prohibited.""(I‘lam al-Muwaqqi‘in\xa0 2/393-395).\nIt says in Kifayat al-Talib ar-Rabbani (1/554): She may cover all of her face and hands with a cloth that she lets down from the top of her head, but she should not use any pins.\nShe should not wear a niqab, burqa‘ or litham; if she does any of that, then she must pay a penalty (fidyah). End quote.\nThe litham is something that is worn over the mouth.\nIt says in al-Misbah al-Munir (2/549): The litham is something that covers the lips.\nAnd it says (2/556, under the root la fa ma): The verb talaffama refers to taking the end of the turban and putting it over the mouth, like a niqab, except that it does not reach the bridge or tip of the nose.\nIf it covers part of the nose, then it is called a niqab. This was stated by Abu Zayd.\nAl-Asma‘i said: If the niqab covers the mouth [only], then it is a lifam or litham. End quote.\nBased on that, the face mask is a niqab, so it is more appropriate that it should be prohibited than the litham.\nThe only difference is that the face mask does not cover the entire face; rather it covers part of it, but it is tailored to cover that part of the face.\nIt says in al-Insaf (3/466): Tailored clothes include that which is tailored to fit the shape of the body part in question. This is according to scholarly consensus.\xa0\nA number of scholars said that it refers to that which is tailored to fit the shape and is intended to do so.\nAl-Qadi and others said: Even if something is worn in a manner other than what is usual, such as wearing socks on the hand or a khuff on the head, the penalty (fidyah) is still due. End quote.\nSo wearing a face mask is not permissible for a woman [in ihram], just as a niqab is not permissible.\nBut if she needs to wear it because of sickness, or because of foul smells, then it is permissible for her to wear it, but she must pay the penalty [fidyah] for doing something that is ordinarily prohibited in ihram because of an ailment.\nShaykh Zakariya al-Ansari (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Asna al-Matalib (1/507): If someone wears when in ihram something that is prohibited to wear in ihram, or if he covers something that is prohibited to cover when in ihram, because he needs to do that due to extreme heat or cold, or for the purpose of medical treatment and the like, it is permissible, but he must pay the penalty (fidyah). End quote.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThere are three scenarios for doing actions that are prohibited when in ihram:\ni. The first scenario is when he does the prohibited action for no essential reason and with no excuse. In this case, he is sinning and must pay the penalty (fidyah).\nii. The second scenario is when he does it for an essential reason. In this case, he is not sinning but he must pay the penalty (fidyah).\nIf he needs to cover his head because of cold or heat from which he fears harm, it is permissible for him to cover it, but he must pay the penalty (fidyah).\niii. The third scenario is when he does it but is excused because he was unaware of the ruling, or he forgot, or he was forced to do it, or he fell asleep. In this case, he is not sinning and he does not have to pay the penalty (fidyah).""(Majmu‘ Fatawa wa Rasa’il al-Uthaymin\xa024/433).\nThe penalty (fidyah) is: to fast for three days; or to feed six poor persons, giving each one half a sa‘ of foodstuff; or to sacrifice a sheep. The pilgrim in ihram may choose any one of these three options.\nAs for a man, there is nothing wrong with him wearing a face mask, because it is not prohibited for him to cover his face [when in ihram], according to the more correct scholarly view. Please see the answer to question no. 106560 .\nSecondly:\nThe woman in ihram should cover her face in front of non-mahram men with something that she lets down from the top of her head over her face.\nIbn Qudamah said: Ibn al-Mundhir said: The view that the burqa‘ is makruh (disliked – when a woman is in ihram) is soundly narrated from Sa‘d, Ibn ‘Umar, Ibn ‘Abbas, and ‘A’ishah, and we do not know of anyone who disagreed with that. Al-Bukhari and others narrated that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “and the woman [in ihram] should not wear a niqab or gloves.”\nBut if she needs to cover her face when men pass by near her, then she should let down the cloth from the top of her head over her face.\nThat was narrated from ‘Uthman and ‘A’ishah, and it was the view of ‘Ata, Malik, ath-Thawri, ash-Shafa‘i, Ishaq and Muhammad ibn al-Hasan, and we do not know of any difference of opinion regarding that. That is because of the report narrated from ‘A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), who said: The riders used to pass by us when we were in ihram with the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). When they came alongside us, one of us would let down her jilbab from her head over her face, then when they had passed us, we would uncover our faces. Narrated by Abu Dawud and al-Athram. Al-Mughni (3/154).\nThe hadith of ‘A’ishah was classed as sahih by al-Albani in Risalat Jilbab al-Mar’ah.\nYou can make this jilbab of light material that you can see through without any difficulty.\nIf that is too difficult for you, then there is nothing wrong with you wearing niqab and paying the penalty (fidyah); that will be better than wearing a face mask which does not cover the entire face.\nAnd Allah knows best']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/315882/ruling-on-a-woman-in-ihram-wearing-a-face-mask
130871,What is the reason for doing Wudu after eating camel meat?,"['Praise be to Allah.Does Eating Camel Meat Break Your Wudu?\nIt is proven that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) enjoined doing Wudu after eating camel meat , but he did not explain the reason why. We know that Allah, may He be glorified, is Most Wise and All Knowing, and He does not prescribe anything for His slaves except that which is good and is in their best interests in this world and the Hereafter, and He does not forbid to them anything but that which is harmful for them in this world and the Hereafter.\xa0\nWhat the Muslim should do is accept the commands of Allah, may He be glorified, and His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and act upon them, even if he does not know the exact reason behind them. Similarly, he has to refrain from that which Allah and His Messenger have forbidden, even if he does not know the exact reason behind it, because he is a slave who is commanded to obey Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). He was created to do that, so he has to obey and submit, whilst believing that Allah is Most Wise and All-Knowing. If he finds out the reason behind it, then that is good upon good.\xa0(Majmu` Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 10/157)\xa0\nWhy do you have to do Wudu after eating camel meat?\nSome of the scholars are of the view that this ruling is the matter of worship and the reason for it is not known.\xa0\nAl-Mardawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The correct view is that doing Wudu after eating camel meat is an act of worship; this is the view of our companions … And it was said that there is a reason for it.” (Al-Insaf, 1/355)\xa0\nThe scholars who said that there is a reason for it mentioned a number of reasons, including the following:\xa0\n\nThe camel has a devilish nature, so whoever eats its meat will develop some devilish energy as a result ; so it is prescribed to do Wudu so as to take away that energy.\n\nIt was narrated that Al-Bara’ ibn `Azib (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was asked about praying in camel pens. He said: “Do not pray in camel pens, for they are of the devils.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 493; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Al-Irwa’, 176)\xa0\nAccording to a version narrated by Ibn Majah (769): “…for they were created from the devils.”\xa0\nIt was narrated that Hamzah ibn `Amr Al-Aslami (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “On the back of every camel there is a devil, so when you ride them, mention the name of Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted…” (Narrated by Ahmad, 2667; classed as sound by Al-Albani in As-Silsilah As-Sahihah, 2271)\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) indicated that camels are of the devils, meaning – and Allah knows best – that they are of the type of the devils, because every stubborn, rebellious creature is a devil, no matter what animal it is. So the black dog is a devil, and camels are the devils of the An`am animals (a category that includes camels, cattle and sheep), and there are also devils among mankind… So if a person eats camel meat that may make him hostile and wild, and cause him to acquire some characteristics like those of devils. The devil was created from fire, and fire is only extinguished by water, so man is enjoined to do Wudu after eating its meat so as to stop that devilish energy and suppress it. That is because the heart and attitude of man is changed by the food that he eats.” (Sharh `Umdat Al-Faqih, 1/185)\xa0\nHe also said:\n“If a person does Wudu after eating camel meat, that will extinguish the devilish energy and will put an end to any negative consequences, unlike the one who does not do Wudu after eating it, and he will see negative consequences. Hence it is said that because the Bedouin eat camel meat without doing Wudu after eating it, grudges developed among them.” (Majmu` Al-Fatawah, 20/523)\xa0\nSimilar comments were made by Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) in I`lam Al-Muwaqqi`in `an Rabb il-`Alamin, 2/40)\n\nCamel meat has a strong impact on the nerves and provokes them. Hence modern medicine tells the hot-tempered individual not to eat a great deal of camel meat. Doing Wudu soothes and calms the nerves. By the same token, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed us to do Wudu at times of anger, so as to calm down. (Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti`, 1/308)\xa0\n\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Whether this is the reason behind it or not, the reason is that it is the command of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), but if we find out the wisdom behind it, that is a blessing from Allah and an increase in knowledge; if we do not know it, then we have to accept and submit.”\xa0\nFor more details, please refer to the following answers: 36736 , 85534 , 10498 , and 20330 .\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/130871/why-do-you-have-to-do-wudu-after-eating-camel-meat
457850,Is it permissible to pray the two rak‘ahs following tawaf [circumambulation of the Ka‘bah] outside the mataf [area surrounding the Ka‘bah where tawaf is done]?,"['Praise be to Allah.It is Sunnah to pray two rak‘ahs following any tawaf, and it is mustahabb [recommended] to do that behind Maqam Ibrahim [the Station of Abraham].\nAl-Bukhari (1627) and Muslim (1234) narrated that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came and circumambulated the House seven times and prayed two rak‘ahs behind the Maqam, then he went out to as-Safa; and Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {Verily, in the Messenger of Allah you have a good example} [al-Ahzab 33:21]. It is permissible to pray these two rak‘ahs anywhere in the mosque, or in Makkah and the Haram zone.\nImam Malik narrated in al-Muwatta’ (1/368) from Humayd ibn ‘Abd ar-Rahman ibn ‘Awf that ‘Abd ar-Rahman ibn ‘Abd al-Qari’ told him that he circumambulated the Ka‘bah with ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab after Fajr prayer. When ‘Umar had finished his tawaf, he looked around and saw that the sun had not risen, so he rode his mount until he halted in Dhu Tuwa, where he prayed two rak‘ahs.\nIbn al-Mundhir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is soundly narrated that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) circumambulated the Ka‘bah, then he prayed two rak‘ahs at the Maqam.\nThe scholars are unanimously agreed that wherever the one who has completed tawaf prays the two rak‘ahs following tawaf, it is acceptable, apart from Malik, who regarded it as makruh (disliked) to pray the two tak‘ahs following tawaf in the Hijr [semi-circular area next to the Ka‘bah]. End quote from al-Ishraf (3/287).\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is Sunnah for the one who has completed tawaf to pray two rak‘ahs after completing it, and it is recommended to offer this prayer behind the Maqam, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {Take the Station of Ibrahim as a place of prayer} [al-Baqarah 2:125].\nWherever he prays these two rak‘ahs and whatever he recites in them, it is permissible, as ‘Umar prayed them in Dhu Tuwa.""(Al-Mughni\xa0 3/347).\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is not obligatory for the one who has completed tawaf to pray the two rak‘ahs behind Maqam Ibrahim. Rather it is prescribed for him to do that if he is able to do it without difficulty, but if he prays them anywhere in al-Masjid al-Haram or in any place in the entire Haram zone, that is acceptable.\nIt is not prescribed for him to push and shove with those who are still circumambulating in order to pray these two rak‘ahs at the Maqam. Rather he should keep away from the crowds and pray them in another part of al-Masjid al-Haram, because on one occasion ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) prayed the two rak‘ahs following tawaf in Dhu Tuwa, which is part of the Haram zone, but it is outside al-Masjid al-Haram. Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) also prayed the two rak‘ahs following tawaf outside al-Masjid al-Haram. What appears to be the case is that the reason she did that was because of the crowds, or because by doing that, she intended to demonstrate to the people how flexible this matter is according to Islamic teachings.""(Fatawa Ibn Baz\xa017/228).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Those who pray behind the Maqam and insist on praying there, when those who are circumambulating the Ka‘bah need the space, are wronging themselves and wronging others. They are sinning, transgressing and doing wrong. They have no right to this space, and you have the right to push them away, you have the right to walk in front of them, and you have the right to step over them when they are prostrating, because they have no right to this space at all.\nThe fact that they insist on being in that place is undoubtedly due to their ignorance, because the two rak‘ahs following tawaf may be done in any part of the mosque. A person can move away from the place where people are circumambulating and pray two rak‘ahs. The caliph ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) even prayed the two rak‘ahs following tawaf in Dhu Tuwa, which is far away from al-Masjid al-Haram, and is not even part of it.\nThe individual must fear Allah regarding himself and fear Allah regarding his brothers. So he should not pray behind Maqam Ibrahim when people need that space for tawaf. He has no protection [in this case, according to Islamic teachings] and we have the right to push him, we have the right to interrupt his prayer, and we have the right to step over him when he is prostrating, because he is the one who is transgressing and doing wrong – Allah forbid.""(Fatawa ‘Ulama’ al-Balad al-Haram\xa0 p. 220).\nConclusion:\nIt is permissible to pray the two rak‘ahs following tawaf in any place in Makkah and the Haram zone. The best is to pray them behind Maqam Ibrahim, if there are no crowds and you will not cause any obstruction or make it difficult for those who are circumambulating the Ka‘bah by praying behind Maqam Ibrahim.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/457850/what-is-the-ruling-on-praying-the-two-rakahs-following-tawaf-outside-the-mataf-area
20847,"Is it permissible for a woman to do her usual household duties such as cooking, looking after the children, and housework, before she does Ghusl following intercourse?","[""Praise be to Allah.Is it permissible for a woman to do housework when she is Junub?\nIt is prohibited for the person who is Junub (in a state of impurity following sexual activity) to pray, perform Tawaf, stay in the mosque, recite Quran or touch the Mus-haf. Everything else is permissible.\xa0\nThere is nothing wrong with a woman who is Junub cooking, looking after her house , taking care of her children or fulfilling any other needs. This is indicated by several pieces of evidence including the following:\xa0\n\nIt was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) met him on one of the roads of Madinah when he was Junub. He said: I turned back and went and did Ghusl , then I came. He said: “Where were you, O Abu Hurayrah?” I said: “I was Junub and I did not like to sit with you when I was not in a state of purity.” He said, “Subhan Allah, the Muslim does not become impure.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 279 and Muslim, 371)\xa0\n\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “This indicates that it is permissible to delay doing Ghusl from the time when it first becomes obligatory, and that it is permissible for the one who is Junub to go about his business.” (Fat-h Al-Bari, 1/391)\xa0\nThe recommendation to hasten to do Ghusl after intercourse\xa0\nIt is better for the one who is Junub to hasten to do Ghusl, lest he forgets that he is Junub. And it is recommended for him to do Wudu before he touches food and drink and before going to sleep. That is better than doing these things when he is Junub. But this Wudu is not obligatory, rather it serves to reduce the impurity, and it is recommended. There are a number of Hadiths concerning that, including the following:\xa0\n\nIt was narrated that `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was Junub and wanted to eat or sleep, he would do Wudu as for prayer. (Narrated by Muslim, 305)\nIt was narrated from Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that `Umar ibn Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) asked the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “Can one of us go to sleep when he is Junub?” He said: “Yes, if he does Wudu then he can go to sleep when he is Junub.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 283 and Muslim, 306)\n\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“This indicates that it is recommended to do Wudu and to wash one's private parts before doing all these things, especially if the man wants to have intercourse with a wife with whom he has not yet had intercourse. It is definitely recommended to wash one's private parts. Our companions have stated that it is disliked to sleep, eat, drink or have intercourse before doing Wudu, and these Hadiths indicate that. There is no dispute among us that this Wudu is not obligatory. This is also the view of Malik and the majority.” (Sharh Muslim, 3/217)\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \xa0\n“It is recommended for the one who is Junub to do Wudu if he wants to eat, drink, sleep or have intercourse again, but it is disliked for him to sleep if he has not done Wudu. It was proven in an authentic narration that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was asked, “Can one of us go to sleep when he is Junub?” He said: “Yes, if he does Wudu as for prayer…”\xa0 (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 21/343)\xa0\nFor more details, please refer to the following answers: 30784 , 20847 , 14225 , 7310 , and 10319\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20847/can-a-woman-do-household-duties-when-she-is-junub
