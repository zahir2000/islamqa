481957,What is the ruling on going to a wedding feast without an invitation?,"['Praise be to Allah.With regard to attending a wedding feast without invitation, there are different scenarios:\n-1-\nThe first scenario is where the feast is only for those whom the host has invited, as is the case with many wedding feasts nowadays.\nIn this case, it is not permissible to attend except by invitation or with the permission of the host of the wedding feast.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{O you who believe, do not enter the houses of the Prophet, unless you are given permission [and are invited] to come for a meal; and do not enter in hopes of getting a meal and waiting for it to be prepared. But if you are invited, then enter}\xa0[Al-Ahzab 33:53].\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThen Allah makes an exception from that, as He says: {unless you are given permission [and are invited] to come for a meal; and do not enter in hopes of getting a meal and waiting for it to be prepared}.\nMujahid, Qatadah and others said: That is, not waiting until the food is ready. In other words, do not watch out for food, until it is almost ready, then you enter. This is something that Allah dislikes and condemns.\nThis indicates that it is prohibited to impose on others, which is what is known as being an uninvited guest. Al-Khatib al-Baghdadi wrote a book condemning those who impose on others, and told many stories about such people, which would take too long to quote here.""(Tafsir Ibn Kathir\xa0 6/454).\nIt says in Sharh al-Khurashi ‘ala Mukhtasar Khalil (3/304):\nA person who has not been invited should not enter except with permission. This means that if someone comes to the place where a wedding feast is being held without an invitation, he should not enter except with permission, and it is not permissible for him to enter, whether he eats or not. End quote.\nIt says in al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah al-Kuwaitiyyah (20/335):\nImposing on people without an invitation:\nIt is not permissible for one who has not been invited to attend wedding feasts or other events, because doing so is unseemly and humiliating oneself, and that is not befitting for a believer…\nThe one who does that is called an uninvited guest or one who imposes on others.\nBased on that, imposing on others is prohibited according to the majority of jurists, unless the uninvited person is a subordinate or attendant of an invited guest who is a prominent figure, and it is known that he does not usually attend events on his own. In that case, it is not prohibited, because the attendant is implicitly included in the invitation to the one whom he serves… End quote.\nAn exception is made if the one who comes without an invitation knows that the host of the wedding feast would be happy to see him, because of ties of friendship or kinship between them, or because he knows that the host is generous and is always happy to welcome guests.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n… But if you know that your friend would be happy to see you, then this is not imposing on him; rather it is a type of kindness and humility on your part. There are many people for whom your coming without an invitation is something more beloved to him, and he will be very happy and will express his joy at that.""(Ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘\xa0 15/428).\n-2-\nThe second scenario is where it is the custom for the host of the wedding feast to give permission to everyone, and he does not prepare food only for those whom he has invited. In this case, there is nothing wrong with one who was not invited attending the feast and eating.\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIslamic teachings say that implicit permission is like explicit permission.""(Madarij as-Salikin\xa0 2/1019).\nIt says in Mughni al-Muhtaj (4/410):\nIt is prohibited to impose yourself, which means attending the wedding feast without being invited, unless you are certain that the host will be pleased with that, because of strong ties of friendship.\nImam [al-Juwayni] restricted that to when the invitation is limited to certain people.\nBut in the case of an invitation that includes everyone, such as when the door is open for whoever wishes to come in [“open house”], then that is not regarded as imposing on others.

119056,Is dealing in gifts and teddy bears prohibited?,"['Praise be to Allah.Is it permissible to sell gifts and toys?\nIt is permissible to deal in products that people give as gifts, such as toys , flowers, cards and the like, provided that they do not involve anything prohibited such as music or images or pictures of animate beings , and do not help in anything prohibited, such as gifts for Valentine’s Day , Christmas , Halloween and so on. This is because it is not permissible to sell anything that is prohibited or helps in anything prohibited, as Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {Help you one another in Al-Birr and At-Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression. And fear Allah. Verily, Allah is Severe in punishment.} [Al-Ma’idah 5:2]\xa0\nAre teddy bears prohibited in Islam?\nWith regard to toys and teddy bears, if they are for children, there is nothing wrong with dealing in them, because there is a concession allowing playing with dolls , and because concessions are granted in the case of children that are not granted in the case of adults.\xa0\nBut if they are bought by adults to decorate their living rooms and cars, then it is not permissible to sell them to them.\nAl-Bukhari and Muslim narrated that `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: I used to play with dolls in the house of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and I had friends who would play with me… (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 613 and Muslim, 2440)\nAl-Hafidh Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Fat-h: “This Hadith is quoted as evidence for the permissibility of keeping dolls and toys so that girls can play with them. That is excluded from the general meaning of the prohibition on keeping images. This was the view of `Iyad, who narrated it from the majority. They regarded it as permissible to sell toys for girls in order to teach them from an early age how to take care of their houses and their children in the future.\xa0\nIbn Hibban wrote a chapter entitled: Permissibility of little girls playing with toys… – according to a report of Jarir from Hisham: [`Ai’shah said:] I used to play with dolls, which are toys. (Narrated by Abu `Awanah and others). Abu Dawud and An-Nasa’i narrated via another chain of narratorsfrom `Aishah that she said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came from the campaign to Tabuk or Khaybar… and he quoted the Hadith about him tearing down the curtain that she had hung up over her door. She said: He lifted the edge of the curtain and saw some dolls belonging to `Aishah. He said: “What is this, O `Aishah?”\xa0 She said: My dolls. He saw among them a horse that had wings attached to it and said: “What is this?” I said: A horse. He said: “A horse with wings?” I said: Have you not heard that Sulayman had horses that had wings? And he smiled.”\xa0\nThe report mentioned by Ibn Hajar was also narrated by Abu Dawud (no. 22813) and classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Ghayat Al-Maram (129).\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: What is the ruling on buying dolls and on the images that are found in books, such as images of animals and birds, and so on, because children enjoy looking at them and they learn by looking at them, and I do not know what the ruling on that is?\nHe replied:\n“With regard to dolls for children, which are three-dimensional images in the form of a woman or a girl or a child, they may be divided into two categories:\n\nThe first category is permissible and there is nothing wrong with it. It includes the dolls that are made nowadays that have no facial features, no eyes or nose or mouth. There are no reservations about the permissibility of these, because `Ai’shah (may Allah be pleased with her) had dolls that were like this, with which she played.\nThe second category is those that are made of plastic and look exactly like human beings, with eyes, lips, eyelashes and eyebrows; some of them even walk and talk. There is some reservation about the permissibility of these, but I am not strict about it, because the Hadith of ‘Ai’shah (may Allah be pleased with her) says that she played with dolls, it may be said that it is indicative of lenience concerning dolls, especially since, as I said, children may enjoy playing with them. Nevertheless we say: so long as there is an alternative to that, we should not turn to that which is doubtful when that which is not doubtful is available, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: Leave that which makes you doubt for that which does not make you doubt.\n\nAs for images of other animals , such as horses, lions and the like, there is no justification for keeping them at all, when we have an alternative in the form of toys that are based on equipment such as cars, bulldozers and the like. A boy can play with those just as he would play with toy animals. But if a person is given one of these animals as a gift, then he should cut off its head and leave it without a head, and there is nothing wrong with that.” (Liqa’ Al-Bab Al-Maftuh, 26/6)\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/119056/is-it-permissible-to-sell-gifts-and-toys
155116,What is the ruling on using cornstarch for cosmetic purposes in some sensitive areas?,"['Praise be to Allah.The jurists differed concerning the ruling on using food for personal hygiene and the like, and there are two views:\nThe first view is that it is permissible and allowed, and there is nothing wrong with using some food items and types of food for the purpose of hygiene and the like.\nThis was stated by the Hanafis and it is mentioned in one report from Imam Malik. It was also the view favoured by Ibn Qudamah among the Hanbalis.\nIt says in al-Fatawa al-Hindiyyah (5/337) – which is a Hanafi book – that Abu Hanifah (may Allah have mercy on him) did not see anything wrong with cleaning the hands with flour after eating. His two companions, Abu Yusuf and Muhammad ibn al-Hasan, were of the same view.\nAn-Nafrawi al-Maliki (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe permissibility of that was narrated from Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him), as he said – regarding Indian pea (chickling vetch, Lathyrus sativus), fava beans (foul) and similar foods –: There is nothing wrong with cleaning one’s hands with them, or scrubbing oneself with them in the bath.""(Al-Fawakih ad-Dawani\xa0 2/321).\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIt was said to Abu ‘Abdillah (Imam Ahmad): What do you say about cleaning one’s hands with the residue left in a sieve? He said: There is nothing wrong with it; we do that.\nAl-Khattabi quoted as evidence for the permissibility of that the report narrated by Abu Dawud with his isnad from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), according to which he instructed a woman to add salt to the water, then wash off menstrual blood with it. Abu Dawud (313); it was classed as da‘if (weak) by al-Albani. Salt is food, and there are similar reports.""(Al-Mughni\xa0 7/221).\nFor more information, please see the answers to questions no. 59899 , 84903 , 145307 .\nThere is nothing wrong with using food items for the purpose of personal hygiene and the like, and that is not regarded as wasting it; rather it is using it for a purpose that is required according to Islamic teachings. Cleaning oneself and making oneself look good are things that are prescribed and encouraged in Islamic teachings.\nThe second view is that it is disliked to use food items for personal hygiene purposes. This is the official view of the Malikis and Hanbalis, but the Hanbalis limited that disapproval (makruh) to using staple foods, not all types of foods.\nAl-Bahuti al-Hanbali (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIt is disliked to clean one’s hands with food if it is a staple food, even if it is flour made from chickpeas, lentils, beans and so on.""(Kashshaf al-Qina‘\xa0\xa05/172).\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThey quoted as evidence for it being disliked to clean one’s hands with staple foods the fact that this leads to those foods becoming contaminated with impurities and dirt. That is why it is not allowed, just as it is not allowed to remove impurities using such foods. Salt is not a staple food; rather it is used to improve the flavor of staple foods.\nYes, it is not allowed to for either humans or jinn to clean themselves after relieving themselves using staple foods of humans and animals. Hence the residue left in a sieve should not be used for cleaning oneself after relieving oneself, even though it is permissible to clean one’s hands with it.\nBut if there is a need to use staple foods, such as tanning with barley flour, or using yoghurt and flour as a remedy for scabies, and the like, then a concession should be granted allowing that…\nThis is the answer that may be given regarding salt, because it is being used for a need.\nAnother piece of evidence is the fact that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed us to lick our fingers and the plate, and to pick up a dropped morsel and remove the dirt from it. All of that is so that no staple food will be wasted, and using it to scrub oneself is not appropriate because something else may be used instead, and it comes under the heading of extravagance, which is the work of the Shaytan. End quote.\nI was asked about a similar case – namely cleaning one’s hands with musk – and I said: This is extravagance, unlike following the traces of menstrual blood with a cloth perfumed with musk, because the latter is a tiny amount that is used for a need, but cleaning the hands with musk is too much and is unnecessary. End quote.\nQuoted by Ibn Muflih in al-Adab ash-Shar‘iyyah (3/211).\nThe right thing is not to use food items for personal hygiene and the like, because there are many readily-available things that can be used instead of them, and that is furthest removed from extravagance and luxury.\nBut if it so happens in some situation that there is nothing available to use for the purpose of personal hygiene except things that are food items, or there is a need for that, then we hope that there will be nothing wrong with using such things in that case, because of need.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/155116/ruling-on-using-food-items-for-personal-hygiene-purposes
72220,"I am in alot of trouble. I can not ask local Iman because he is not good in his knowledge and I am embarrassed to ask friends or family. You see, the problem is I got married recently and I think I might have committed zina with my wife. This is how we were driving my sister's car and me and my wife stopped the car in a quiet place and we kissed a lot, quite a lot. a man walked passed and he saw us, but we did not stop. I feel I have committed open zina. Do we need to pay Kafarah (expiation), or confess to our elders? My second very very important question is after kissing, I let out (we were both wearing clothes all the time mufti sab) sperm in my underwear. Now I feel very bad because this is my sister's car and she has been driving it after me. i can not wash the car seat as she will get suspicious and confront me. i do not want to lie, now she sits in the car sits on the floor to eat dinner, sits on the sofa, her and her children and i feel very very bad as to what to do. is the car and sofa and place were we sit not clean anymore, and my wife and i are arguing she blames me for worrying. i think she is a bad muslim, because she does not fear Allah, because she made me stop the car and kiss, i hate her for that. Dear sir, I await your reply as I am disturbed by what has happened, i like to keep pak and clean at all times to please Allah.","[""Praise be to Allah.The nature of human imperfection\nPlease note that you will never be able to live your life without sins and mistakes. This is the nature of man. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Every son of Adam commits sin, and the best of those who commit sin are those who repent.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 2499 and Ibn Majah, 4251. It was classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Tirmidhi)\nThis Hadith clearly indicates that man will inevitably commit sin, but what matters after that is what he does about his sin. The believer repents to Allah from all his sins, gives them up and asks Allah for forgiveness every time he commits a sin, and he regrets doing it and resolves sincerely not to do it again. If you do that, then understand that Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful; He forgives all sins for the righteous believer who repents sincerely and admits his sin humbly before Allah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): {Say: O My slaves! who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allah, verily, Allah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.} [Az-Zumar 39:53]\nIs kissing one’s wife in public Zina?\nThe sin that you have admitted to is not Zina with your wife! Rather it is kissing her in front of other people, because there is no Zina with one's wife, rather Zina is done with a woman whom it is not permissible for a man to touch . But in the case of a wife, it is permissible to touch her. \nIs it prohibited to kiss your wife in public?\nIt is not permissible for a man or a woman to speak to anyone else of what happens between them in bed which no one else should see but them, because of the evils and temptations that result from that and because it opens the door to the devil. This has to do with one who speaks about what he did with his wife, so how about one who does things in front of people where they can see him! \nShaykh Muhammad ibn Ibrahim (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his Fatawa (10/277) that kissing one’s wife in front of people is not permissible . \nExpiation for kissing one’s wife in public\nAs for the expiation for this sin , there is no expiation except sincere repentance and firm resolve not to do it again, and true regret for having committed this sin. \nAs for confessing to your parents, there is no need for that. The sin that you have admitted to is a sin against Allah, so confession should be made to Allah. It is between you and Allah and you should not tell anyone about it, but be sincere in your repentance to Allah and Allah will forgive you. Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. \nThe fact that your wife is the one who told you to do this deed does not mean that she is not a righteous woman or that she does not fear Allah. You also agreed with her to do it, and you did not stop even when that man saw you. So you should also shoulder your share of responsibility for what you did. \nMay Allah help you to do that which He loves and which pleases Him. \nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/72220/is-it-prohibited-to-kiss-your-wife-in-public
