426305,What's Tafseer of Quran 83:20? someone on TikTok says it's a digital book of our life in Dunya and we see it in Jannah?,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nAllah, the Exalted, mentioned ""Al-Marqum"" in Surah Al-Mutaffifin, where He says (translation of the meaning): {A written book}\xa0[Al-Mutaffifin: 9], [Al-Mutaffifin: 20].\nThe scholars of Tafsir unanimously agree that ""Al-Marqum"" refers to ""the written.""\nAl-Tabari said: ""By Al-Marqum, it means the written,"" end quote.\n""Tafsir Al-Tabari"" (24/197).\nAth-Tha`labi said: ""Written and affirmed upon them, like a pattern on a garment, it is not forgotten nor erased until they are recompensed for it,"" end quote.\n""Tafsir Ath-Tha`labi"" (29/56).\nIbn Kathir said: ""His statement (translation of the meaning): {A written book} is not an explanation of His statement (translation of the meaning): {And what can make you know what is Sijjin?}, but rather it is an explanation of what is written for them regarding their destiny to Sijjin, meaning: recorded, written, and concluded, no one is added to it nor subtracted from it; this was said by Muhammad ibn Ka`b Al-Qurazi,"" end quote.\n""Tafsir Ibn Kathir"" (8/350).\nAl-Wahidi said: ""As for the meaning of Al-Marqum in the language: (Al-Layth said: {A written book} its letters have been clarified with its diacritical marks, and a merchant marks his garment with his brand.\nAnd Abu Al-`Abbas said: {A written book} meaning written, and he recited (poetry):\nI will inscribe to you in the clear water... Even if you are far, if there is an inscriber in the water\nMeaning I will write,"" end quote.\n""Al-Tafsir Al-Basit"" (23/321).\nAs for the origin of the term in the language, Sheikh Muhammad Jabal said:\n""(Ar-Raqmah - with a fatha: a garden, and the mark of the valley: where its water gathers, and the marked land: a land with a scattering of plants).\nThe central meaning is distinguished by a limited area on a vast surface: like a garden among its surroundings, and as taken from the definition of Al-Marqumah land that it has scattered patches of plants, and like a spot where water gathers in a valley. And from it: ""He Raqamah the garment (Nasr): he patterned it, and the merchant Raqamah (marks) his garment with his brand, and he Raqamah (marked) the book: he dotted it and clarified its letters with its diacritical marks. And Al-Marqum\xa0among animals: the one with branded lines on its legs, each one is a Raqmah - with a fatha. And Al-Mirqam: the pen. (With which marks and lines are drawn) and Ar-Raqm: a patterned type of silk (fa`l with the meaning of maf`ul). And in the description of the sky: a roof marked (Raqim) (its marks are the stars). And Al-Arqam among snakes is the speckled one.""\nFrom it: ""Ar-Raqm: writing and sealing""; because they are drawings on the surface of a tablet, or the like, with ink of a different color. {Or do you think that the companions of the cave and the inscription (Ar-Raqim)} it is a tablet, or a book. And the aforementioned are closer to the origin. And the claim of Arabization is strange with no basis.\n{A written book} [Al-Mutaffifin: 9, 20]\nwritten, like a pattern on a garment, it is not forgotten nor erased.\nThis ""and Al-Khatt"": its origin is closer to the rectangular engraving, and the inscription is also engraving.\n""Ar-Raqm"" is like painting with ink and the like, but there is nothing to prevent the mark (Ar-Raqm) from being used in writing then as engraving, because the writing appears with its color and permanence on the surface of the white tablet, black inscriptions like the mark,"" end quote.\n""Al-Mu`jam Al-Ishtiqaqi Al-Mu\'assal"" (2/841-842).\nSecondly:\nWe must know that understanding the Book of Allah should be taken from reliable sources, and we do not know the nature of this book, and it is not permissible to speak about it without knowledge.\nIt was reported from `Abd Ar-Rahman ibn Zayd ibn Aslam who said: ""The inscription is a book, and that book has a story, but Allah did not inform about that book and what is in it. And he recited (translation of the meaning): {And what can make you know what is Illiyun*\xa0It is [their destination\xa0recorded in] a register inscribed*\xa0Which is witnessed by those brought near [to Allāh].} [Al-Mutaffifin: 19-21], {And what can make you know what is Sijjin*\xa0It is [their destination\xa0recorded in] a register inscribed.} [Al-Mutaffifin: 8-9],"" end quote.\n""Mawsu`ah At-Tafsir Al-Ma\'thur"" (13/422).\nAs for what this claimant said, who dared to speak about the Book of Allah without knowledge or evidence, that it is a ""digital book,"" merely because of the ""similarity"" in the word, to the modern term, it is audacity towards the Book of Allah, and speaking about Allah without knowledge or evidence. And Allah, the Exalted, said (translation of the meaning): {Say, ""My Lord has only forbidden immoralities - what is apparent of them and what is concealed - and sin, and oppression without right, and that you associate with Allah that for which He has not sent down authority, and that you say about Allah that which you do not know.""}\xa0[Al-A`raf/33]\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/426305/tafsir-of-quran-839
244237,"We live in an area that is pretty secluded and as such, it is frequented by many dangerous and venomous snakes.","['Praise be to Allah.The Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) enjoined the killing of snakes , and this is general in meaning and applies to all kinds of snakes, in any place. But if the snake is inside the house, it should not be killed until it has been warned three times; that is because of the possibility that it may be a jinn . Then if it appears after that, it may be killed.\nIt was narrated from Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that he heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) address the people from the pulpit, saying: “Kill snakes.”\n`Abdullah ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “After that, I would not leave any snake that I saw but I would kill it.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 3299 and Muslim, 3233)\nAbu Dawud (5249) narrated that Ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Kill all the snakes, and whoever fears their revenge does not belong to me.” (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud)\nMuslim (2233) narrated that Nafi` (may Allah have mercy on him) said: One day `Abdullah ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) was at a ruin of his, when he saw the flash of a small snake. He said: Find this snake and kill it. Abu Lubabah Al-Ansari s(may Allah be pleased with him) aid: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbid killing the small snakes that live in houses, except the short-tailed snake and the one with two stripes, for they are the ones that cause blindness and miscarriages.\nAnd Muslim (2236) narrated that Abu As-Sa’ib said: We entered upon Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri, and whilst we were sitting there, we heard a movement beneath the bed. We looked and saw a snake… and he quoted the Hadith, in which it says: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “These houses have inhabitants. If you see any of them, ask them to leave for three days. If it goes (all well and good), otherwise kill it, for it is a Kafir.”\nIbn `Abd Al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Some scholars said: It is not essential for snakes to be warned or urged or asked to leave except in Madinah only. Others said that Madinah and other places are the same in that regard, because some snakes are jinn and may be found in Madinah and elsewhere, and whoever among them Allah wills may be Muslim. Malik said: What I prefer is that the snakes that are found in houses, in Madinah and elsewhere, should be warned for three days, but snakes should not be warned if they are found in the desert.”\nIbn `Abd Al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“It is preferable that all snakes that are found in houses should be warned, as Malik said. What is meant by warning is that the person who sees a snake in his house should say: I urge you, O snake, not to appear before us or harm us.” (At-Tamhid, 16/263)\nIbn `Abd Al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“The scholars unanimously agreed that it is permissible to kill desert snakes, whether they are small or large, no matter what type they are.” (At-Tamhid, 16/28)\nSo there is nothing wrong with you killing snakes that are outside the house. As for those that are found inside the house, they should not be killed until they have been warned for three days.\nWith regard to the view that killing the jinn that appear in the form of snakes brings bad luck, this is a false view for which there is no basis.\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 1239 , 21901 , 8814 , 2896 , 8804 , and 127221 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/244237/is-killing-snakes-allowed-in-islam
322661,"I was talking with my friend about the etiquette of debate, and saying that if you advise me in front of a group, then you have shamed me, but if you advise me in front of six eyes, then you have been sincere in your advice to me. He said to me: What do you mean by six eyes? I said to him: As for the four eyes, they are my two eyes and your two eyes. As for the other two eyes, they are the two eyes of ar-Rahman (the Most Gracious), which are real, because He, may He be glorified, has two real eyes, without likening them to anything, discussing how they are, denying them, interpreting them in a manner other than the apparent meaning, or distorting the meaning. Allah sees me with His two eyes that are real. And I quoted as evidence the verse in which Allah, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning):","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nAhl as-Sunnah affirm the divine attribute of the Eye; in their view, it is an attribute of His Essence that is known from the religious texts and is affirmed for Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, on the basis of the Quran and Sunnah. Ahl as-Sunnah wa’l-Jama‘ah believe that Allah sees with His eyes, and they believe that Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has two eyes in a manner that is befitting to Him. {There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the Hearing, the Seeing} [Ash-Shura 42:11].\nThe evidence for that from the Quran:\n-1-\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And construct the ship under Our watchful eyes and Our inspiration}\xa0[Hud 11:37].\n-2-\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And I bestowed upon you love from Me that you would be brought up under My eye} [Ta-Ha 20:39].\n-3-\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Be patient with your Lord’s decree [O Muhammad], for verily you are under Our watchful eyes}\xa0[at-Tur 52:48].\nEvidence from the Sunnah:\n-1-\nAbu Dawud (13/37) narrated from ‘Awn with a hasan isnad from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) recited this verse (interpretation of the meaning): {Indeed, Allah is ever Hearing and Seeing} [an-Nisa’ 4:58], and he placed his thumb on his ear and his forefinger over his eyes.\n-2-\nIt was narrated that ‘Abdullah said: Mention was made of the Dajjal in the presence of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and he said: “Allah is not unknown to you. Indeed Allah is not one-eyed” – and he pointed to his eye – “but the false messiah the Dajjal is one-eyed and cannot see out of his right eye; his eye is like a floating grape.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (7407).\nIbn Khuzaymah said in Kitab at-Tawhid (1/97), after quoting a number of verses: It is obligatory for every believer to affirm for his Creator and Maker what the Creator and Maker affirmed for Himself of eyes. He is not a true believer who denies for Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, what He has affirmed for Himself in a clear text and was explained by the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), to whom Allah gave the task of explaining His words, as He said (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And We revealed to you the message that you may make clear to the people what was sent down to them}\xa0[An-Nahl 16:44].\nSo the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) explained that Allah has two eyes, and his explanation was in accordance with the revealed text, which you find in the pages of the Mushaf and it is recited by the imams in prayer and is taught to children in the schools.\nAnd he said (1/114): We say: Our Lord the Creator has two eyes with which He sees whatever lies beneath the ground, whatever lies beneath the lowest, seventh earth, and whatever is in the highest heavens… End quote.\nAl-Lalka’i included a chapter in Usul al-I‘tiqad (412) with the title: Texts from the Book of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, and the Sunnah of His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) which indicate that the attributes of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, include the Face, the two Eyes and the two Hands. End quote.\nShaykh ‘Abdullah al-Ghunayman said in Sharh Kitab at-Tawhid min Sahih al-Bukhari (1/285): The words “Allah is not one-eyed”: this phrase is where the evidence regarding this matter is to be found in this hadith. This indicates that Allah has two real eyes, because the one who is one-eyed is lacking one of the two eyes, or has lost vision in one eye. End quote.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said in ‘Aqidat Ahl as-Sunnah wa’l-Jama‘ah (p. 12): Ahl as-Sunnah are unanimously agreed that the divine eyes are two, and that is supported by what the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said about the Dajjal: “He is one-eyed and your Lord is not one-eyed.” End quote.\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) gave a lengthy answer about this attribute, in which he affirmed that Allah has two eyes, in Majmu‘ al-Fatawa (3/41-50).\nSee also what al-Baghawi said about His Fingers and what Ibn Kathir said about His hearing.\nEnd quote from Sifat Allah by Shaykh ‘Alawi as-Saqqaf (260-262).\nSee also the answer to question no. 145166 .\nSecondly:\nWhat we think is that the way you spoke to your friend was too complicated and there was no need for it.\nYes, we affirm the divine attribute of the eye in a manner that befits the divine attribute of His Face, and we also say that He has two eyes, not one eye, and we would not refrain from pointing out that they are two, because the text is clear about that, as explained above. More than one of the scholars narrated that there is consensus among Ahl as-Sunnah on affirming that they are two eyes.\nThe impact of that on the individual’s behaviour and attitude is that he will strive hard not to let Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, see him where He forbade him to be, and to let Him see him where He commanded him to be; he will strive to do what Allah likes to see him do and will be wary of doing anything that will deprive him of Allah, the Most Generous, looking at him and will deprive him of that blessing.\nBut mentioning that in the plural form including your two eyes, the two eyes of your friend and the two eyes of the Most Gracious, may He be glorified and exalted, is unnecessary and silly. It is as if you wanted to say something weird, as is quite clear, since your friend needed to ask you about these six and you needed to explain that to him, then you had to follow that by mentioning how Ahl as-Sunnah wa’l-Jama‘ah understand the divine attributes. All of that is unnecessary; rather it would have been sufficient for you to remind him of the etiquette of offering advice, and the difference between that and shaming someone or exposing his faults, in accordance with what the scholars have said about the matter, with no need for any of the things you mentioned.\nTherefore, we advise you not to do that or anything similar to it, and not to complicate straightforward matters. You should limit yourself to that which is clear and used by the scholars, and what was transmitted from the righteous predecessors (as-salaf as-salih); we did not see any of that in what you said.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/322661/the-divine-attribute-of-the-eye-and-affirming-that-allah-possesses-this-attribute
97938,"Is it permissible for a very close friend of mine to remove pubic hair for me? I am very afraid and I am having problems because of this hair. If my friend removes it for me there will be a pact between us that she will never speak of anything that she sees, and I need to remove it, but I feel too shy to ask my mother to remove it for me?","['Praise be to Allah.Shaving the pubic hair is one of the Sunnahs of the Fitrah , and Islam has stipulated that it should not be left without shaving for more than forty days . The basic principle is that every accountable person should shave his pubic hair himself, unless he is unable to do that because he is too old or is sick .\xa0\nWhat the sister who is asking this question wants to do is a prohibited action, and is an evil deed that it is not permissible for any Muslim woman to do except in cases of necessity. The fact that she is afraid to remove her hair is no excuse. This is not something that requires bravery and courage. There are many ways of removing it, some of which are easy.\xa0\nIt does not make it permissible if her friend swears an oath not to tell anyone of what she sees. If it is permissible to do this because of necessity, her mother is a better person to shave her pubic hairs.\xa0\nThe authentic texts state that it is prohibited for a man to look at the `Awrah of another man , or for a woman to look at the `Awrah of another woman , and the scholars unanimously agreed on this prohibition.\xa0\nIt was narrated that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No man should look at the `Awrah of another man, and no woman should look at the `Awrah of another woman.”\xa0(Narrated by Muslim, 338)\xa0\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “As for a man with another man, each of them may look at that of his companion which is not `Awrah. And the ruling on a woman with a woman is the same as the ruling on a man with a man.” (Al-Mughni, 7/80)\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“This is covering of women before men, and covering of men before men and women before women with regard to the `Awrah, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No man should look at the `Awrah of another man, and no woman should look at the `Awrah of another woman, and he said: “Guard your `Awrah from everyone but your wife and that which your right hand possesses (i.e., slave woman).” I said: What if the people are living with one another?\xa0 He said: “If you can prevent anyone seeing it, then do not let him see it.” I said: What if I am alone? He said: “Allah is more deserving that you should feel shy before Him.” And he forbade a man to lie with a man under one cover, or a woman to lie with a woman under one cover. And he said concerning children: “Teach them to pray when they are seven and smack them if they do not pray when they are ten, and separate them in their beds.” He forbade looking at or touching the `Awrah of a person of the same gender, because that is abhorrent and immoral. As for men with women, this is because of the issue of sexual desire.” (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 22/113)\xa0\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“… This is something concerning which there is no difference of opinion. It is prohibited for a man to look at a woman’s `Awrah and for a woman to look at a man’s `Awrah, according to scholarly consensus. An exception is made for the married couple, who may look at one another’s `Awrahs.” (Fath Al-Bari, 9/338, 339)\xa0\nIn conclusion, it is not permissible for you to ask your friend to shave your pubic hair for you, or to let her do that. If you do that, you will both be committing a major sin, and you will not be excused for that, because it is easy to find other ways of removing this hair, such as using the well-known depilatories, if you cannot use a razor.\xa0\nThis is permissible in cases of necessity when one is unable to move , or if one is sick or insane and other cases where a man or woman is unable to shave the pubic hair.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/97938/can-a-woman-remove-the-pubic-hair-of-another-woman
