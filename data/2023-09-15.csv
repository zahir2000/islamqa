265796,"We built a house on land belonging to my maternal aunt, but we took 1.5 m of the road to build a yard for the house, and a fence for privacy. Please note that that does not affect passers-by, and we live in a country where lawlessness prevails.","['Praise be to Allah.I put this question to our shaykh, ‘Abd ar-Rahman al-Barrak (may Allah, may He be exalted, preserve him), and he replied:\nIt is not permissible for you to do that, even if it does not constrict the road or affect passers-by, because the road is public property and belongs to everyone, so it is not permissible to transgress or encroach on it.

453133,"I own a house, and a tenant came and agreed with me that he would rent the house for one year, paying $100 for each four-month period. So he paid me $300 in return for living in the house for a year. Then the earthquake came and destroyed the house, and the man and his wife died.","['Praise be to Allah.If someone rents out a house and it is destroyed, the rental contract is annulled for the remaining period, but rent must be paid for the past as agreed.\nIn al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (7/26) it says: The jurists are agreed that if the rented item is destroyed, then the rental contract is annulled, such as if a specific mount dies or a rented house collapses. End quote.\nIt says in ar-Rawd al-Murbi‘ (p. 414): The rental contract is annulled if the rented item is destroyed, such as a mount or slave who dies, because the benefit of it is lost entirely.\nIf the destruction occurs within the rental period, then what remains is annulled but the past rent should be paid. End quote.\nSo if the tenant had lived in the house for two months out of that year, this is one sixth of the rental period, so one sixth of the rent should be paid, which is fifty dollars. And you must return the remaining amount to his heirs.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/453133/he-rented-out-his-house-for-one-year-then-it-was-destroyed-in-the-earthquake-what-is-he-entitled-to-of-the-rent
