415957,"My in-laws are from the Tablighi jamat and their scolar who came to our house said that we shld stop complain and gave refrence of the incident where Hazrat Fatima complained about Hazrat Ali 's big stomach wealth and quoted this When Fatimah came, the Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) asked her if she came to complain about Ali. She replied that she had. The Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said: ""By the Lord of the Ka'bah! Go back to Ali and tell him that you are prepared to rub your nose in dust in order to keep him happy. You may do as you please."" (Jailul 'Uyoon: 61) Is this incident authentic or jus a made up story.","['Praise be to Allah.We have not come across this report which speaks of Fatimah (may Allah be pleased with her) complaining to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) about her husband ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him).\nWith regard to women complaining about their husbands, that is not all at the same level. In some cases it is permissible, in order for the woman to ward off harm from herself or her faith.\nAn example of that is the report narrated by al-Bukhari (5364) and Muslim (1714) from ‘A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), according to which Hind bint ‘Utbah said: O Messenger of Allah, Abu Sufyan is a stingy man and he does not give me enough maintenance for myself and my children, except what I take from him without his knowledge. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Take what is sufficient for you and your children, on a reasonable basis.”\nIn the case of Fatimah (may Allah be pleased with her, when the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) feared that she would be put to trial, he listened to her complaint.\nAl-Bukhari (3729) and Muslim (2449) narrated that al-Miswar ibn Makhramah said: ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib proposed to the daughter of Abu Jahl, and he was already married to Faatimah the daughter of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). When Faatimah heard of that she came to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and said: Your people are saying that you do not get angry for the sake of your daughters, and ‘Ali is going to marry the daughter of Abu Jahl.\nThe Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) stood up and I heard him when he recited the shahadah, then he said: “I gave a daughter of mine in marriage to Abu’l-‘As ibn ar-Rabi‘, and when he spoke he told me the truth. Fatimah bint Muhammad is a part of me, and I do not like to see her upset. By Allah, the daughter of the Messenger of Allah and the daughter of the enemy of Allah will not be joined together as wives of one man.” So ‘Ali abandoned that proposal.\nAccording to a report narrated by al-Bukhari (3110) and Muslim (2449) from al-Miswar ibn Makhramah, he said: ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib proposed marriage to the daughter of Abu Jahl (to be a co-wife) to Fatimah, and I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) addressing the people concerning that, on this minbar of his, and I was an adolescent at that time. He said: “Fatimah is part of me, and I fear lest she be put to trial with regard to her religious commitment.”\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“and I fear lest she be put to trial with regard to her religious commitment” means: she will not be able to put up with jealousy, so if she became angry, she would treat her husband in a way that is not befitting to her commitment to Islam [because it would be contrary to Islamic teachings].""(Fath al-Bari\xa0 9/329).\nWith regard to problems that the Muslim woman is able to resolve through dialogue with her husband and with patience, it is more appropriate in this case for her not to complain.\nShaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\nThe questioner is saying: I have a sister who is married, and she has problems with her husband and his family. When she comes to visit us, she tells us what is happening to her and her children, and she cries a great deal, because she is being mistreated a great deal. We advise her to be patient, but I wonder: does she have the right to do that when she is with us? May Allah reward you with good, what do you advise us to do?\nAnswer: we advise her to be patient, if her husband is a good man; we advise her to be patient and not complain to you and not tell you anything. Rather that should be between her and her husband. If she is able to ask his father, older brother or maternal or paternal uncle, if they are good, to advise him, if there is a need to do that, then there is nothing wrong with it. But whenever it is possible for her to solve her problems between her and him by herself, that is more appropriate. She should use good manners and good words, and show kindness, until he calms down, so that he can respond to her request, and she should not be harsh and tough, and should not forsake him and the like. Rather she should handle matters wisely, with good words and a kind approach.\nThe husband should fear Allah and treat his wife kindly, using good words and a gentle approach. Each of them should strive to show kindness and goodness, as Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And live with them in kindness}\xa0[An-Nisa’ 4:19]\n{And due to the wives is similar to what is expected of them, according to what is reasonable}\xa0[Al-Baqarah 2:228].""(Nur ‘ala ad-Darb\xa021/234).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/415957/did-the-prophet-blessings-and-peace-of-allah-be-upon-him-forbid-his-daughter-fatimah-to-complain-about-her-husband
20227,"I like one girl, and we are gonna get WED in future. My parents are fully agreed with my decision, so her parents. Everything is going alright. The problem I am encountered with is, ""She is Christian."" While discussing with each others, I have asked her to Embrace ISLAM, And I have been given many information regarding islam so she can understand each and everything, It seems she doesn't want to EMBRACE islam. As she said "" I am very very strong christian, I just cannot accept any faith than christianity, I cannot become Muslim. She doesn't eat pork, nor, does she drinks, She is a Chaste lady with her true feelings and a Clean heart. This is true that she has nothing against my faith. She is agree to accept me with my faith and she wants me accept her with her faith, and the children would be MUSLIMS. This is what we have decided so far. Some of my friends advised me to FORCE her to EMBRACE ISLAM, Like threaten ""I won't marry you if you don't Embrace islam"" This is what my friend advised me, But as far as I realize, This wouldn't be fair at all. please Tell Me Should I force her to become Muslim? I guess, to embrace islam she must have the feelings that ALLAH is One and she should have the real feelings instead of fake feelings. I don't want to force her cause I'm scared that IF she becomes Muslim JUST to show me, JUST to get married with me, It's gonna be SIN on me. I want she to become Muslim from her true feelings and real feelings with that ALLAH is One and He is the God. I am trying my best to provide her knowledge of Islam and to show her the right path. Please tell me Should I force her?
IF she refuses to embrace Islam, Can I marry her? Can she and I get married and live as husband and wife?","['Praise be to Allah.Can Muslims Marry Christians?\nAllah has permitted a Muslim man to marry Jewish and Christian woman , on condition that they are chaste and avoid zina (unlawful sexual relations), and that the husband\xa0of that Christian woman (who is a Muslim) will then have wilayah over her.\xa0\nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Made lawful to you this day are At-Tayyibat [all kinds of Halal (lawful) foods, which Allah has made lawful (meat of slaughtered eatable animals, milk products, fats, vegetables and fruits)]. The food (slaughtered cattle, eatable animals) of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) is lawful to you and yours is lawful to them. (Lawful to you in marriage) are chaste women from the believers and chaste women from those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) before your time when you have given their due Mahr (bridal-money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage), desiring chastity (i.e. taking them in legal wedlock) not committing illegal sexual intercourse, nor taking them as girlfriends. And whosoever disbelieves in Faith, [i.e. in the Oneness of Allah and in all the other Articles of Faith i.e. His (Allah’s) Angels, His Holy Books, His Messengers, the Day of Resurrection and Al-Qadar (Divine Preordainment)], then fruitless is his work; and in the Hereafter he will be among the losers.” [Al-Maidah 5:5]\nWhat is meant by chaste is refraining from zina (unlawful sexual relationships).\xa0\nIbn Kathir said:\xa0\n“This is the view of the majority, which is the most correct opinion, so as to avoid the combination of her being a non-Muslim with her being unchaste, which would mean that she is totally corrupt and thus her husband will get, as the Arabic proverb says, “Bad goods and cheated on the weight.” The apparent meaning of the ayah is that what is meant is those who are chaste and refrain from zina.” (Tafsir Ibn Kathieer, 3/55)\xa0\nThe condition of the woman’s wali being a Muslim is indicated by the verse (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And never will Allah grant to the disbelievers a way (to triumph) over the believers.” [Al-Nisa 4:141]\nHowever, we do not advise you to marry a non-Muslim woman, nor do we advise you to marry just any Muslim woman. For married life is not based only on beauty and attraction, rather the wise Muslim must look with insight at what is beyond that, because he needs to be sure that his house will be looked after in his absence, and he needs to bring up his children, and he will not be able to find that or other things which every wise husband seeks, except with a religious Muslim woman. This is the advice of our Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).\xa0\nAbu Hurayrah narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “A woman may be married for four reasons: her wealth, her lineage, her beauty and her religious commitment. Choose the one who is religious, may your hands be rubbed with dust [i.e., may you prosper].”\xa0((Narrated by al-Bukhari, 4802; Muslim, 1466)\xa0\nAl-Nawawi said:\xa0\n“The correct meaning of this hadith is that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was describing what people usually do, for they seek these four characteristics, the last of which in their view is religious commitment, but you, the one who is seeking guidance, should look for a wife who is religious. But this is not an absolute command.\xa0\nThis hadith encourages keeping company with people who are religiously committed in all things, because the one who keeps company with them will benefit from their good attitude and morals, their blessing and their good ways, and he will be safe from mischief at their hands.” (Sharh Muslim, 10/52)\xa0\nA realistic look at marriage to women of the People of the Book\nBut marriage to women of the People of the Book leads to a great deal of mischief and trouble, such as:\xa0\n\nHe may have to be courteous to this wife of his at the expense of his religion, especially if she is “very committed” to her own religion. This may mean that she will hang up crosses and go to the church, and the children will not be safe in this environment.\nShe is not going to wash properly after finishing her period, or tell him not to have intercourse with her when she is menstruating; she is going to make him do something that is wrong according to shari’ah and cause him physical harm.\nHe is going to be put in an embarrassing situation because of her careless attitude concerning dress and her mixing with men and speaking to them.\nThe states and governments of these women of the Book will be on their side and will give them custody of the children if differences arise and divorce takes place. This will cause these children to be lost and to fall into kufr. Such cases are too well known to need mentioning here and too many to count.\n\nIt may be said:\xa0\nMarriage to a Christian is not ideal as the likelihood of the children becoming Christian is high..\nYou must look for one who is religiously committed, if you want a sound marriage.\nForget about the people of kufr and beware of marrying them, for that will lead to a lot of evil.\nThe children of such a marriage will not be guided; they will swell the ranks of evildoers.\xa0\nCan you force your Christian wife to become Muslim?\nIt is not permissible for you to force your Christian wife – if you do marry her – to become Muslim. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“There is no compulsion in religion. Verily, the Right Path has become distinct from the wrong path. Whoever disbelieves in Taghut [falsehood, false gods] and believes in Allah, then he has grasped the most trustworthy handhold that will never break. And Allah is All-Hearer, All-Knower.” [Al-Baqarah 2:256]\nIbn Kathir said:\xa0\n“Allah says: “There is no compulsion in religion ” meaning: do not force anyone to enter Islam, for it is obvious and clear, and its proof and evidence are apparent. There is no need to force anyone to enter it, rather whomever Allah guides to Islam and opens his heart to it and illuminates his insight will enter it with conviction; but whoever Allah makes blind in his heart and seals his hearing and insight will not benefit from being compelled to enter the religion by force. They said that the reason for the revelation of this verse was concerning some people among the Ansar, even though this ruling is general.” (Tasfieer Ibn Kathir, 1/311)\xa0\nWe advise you – once again – to leave this woman and to pray to Allah to guide your heart to that which is in the best interests of your religion. So long as you give her up for the sake of Allah, then you should be certain that Allah will replace her for you with someone better, for whoever gives up something for the sake of Allah, Allah will compensate him with something better.\xa0\nFor more, please see these answers: 21380 , 8396 , and 21047 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20227/can-a-muslim-marry-a-christian
