477478,"“Subhan alladhi yusabbih ur-ra‘du bi hamdihi wa’l-mala’ikatu min kheefatihi (Glory be to the One Whom the thunder glorifies and praises, and the angels [also glorify Him] out of fear and awe of Him.” Should we repeat this dhikr if the thunder is continuous, or is it sufficient to say it once only?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThere is no proven report from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that he used to say this dhikr when hearing thunder. Rather it was narrated with a sound isnad from ‘Abdullah ibn az-Zubayr (may Allah be pleased with him) that if he heard thunder, he would stop speaking and say: “Subhan alladhi yusabbih ur-ra‘du bi hamdihi wa’l-mala’ikatu min kheefatihi (Glory be to the One Whom the thunder glorifies and praises, and the angels [also glorify Him] out of fear and awe of Him.” Then he would say: This [thunder] is a stern warning to the people of the earth.\nNarrated by al-Bukhari in al-Adab al-Mufrad (723) and Malik in al-Muwatta’ (3641). Its isnad was classed as sahih by an-Nawawi in al-Adhkar (235) and al-Albani in Sahih al-Adab al-Mufrad (556).\nIt was also narrated from others among the Sahabah.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: They narrated from Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: We were with ‘Umar on a journey and suddenly there was thunder, lightning and hail. Ka‘b said to us: Whoever says three times when he hears thunder “Subhan alladhi yusabbih ur-ra‘du bi hamdihi wa’l-mala’ikatu min kheefatihi (Glory be to the One Whom the thunder glorifies and praises, and the angels [also glorify Him] out of fear and awe of Him” will be protected from that thunder. We said it and we were protected.""(Al-Adhkar by an-Nawawi\xa0 p. 181).\nIbn ‘Allan said: al-Hafiz said: This isnad is hasan and mawquf [meaning that it stops at the Sahabi]. Even though it was narrated from Ka‘b, Ibn ‘Abbas and ‘Umar approved of it, which indicates that it has a basis. \xa0\nEnd quote from al-Futuhat ar-Rabbaniyyah ‘ala al-Adhkar an-Nawawiyyah (4/286).\nHence it is recommended (mustahabb) to say this dhikr when hearing thunder.\nIt was narrated in a marfu‘ report from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that when he heard the sound of thunder and lightning, he would say: “Allahumma la taqtulna bi ghadabika wa la tuhlikna bi ‘adhabika, wa ‘afina qabla dhalika (O Allah, do not kill us with Your wrath and do not destroy us with Your punishment and protect us before that).”\nNarrated by at-Tirmidhi (3450), who said: This is a gharib hadith; we only know it through this isnad. It was classed as da‘if (weak) by an-Nawawi in al-Adhkar (p. 181) and by al-Albani in Da‘if at-Tirmidhi (3694).\nEven though this hadith is da‘if, as at-Tirmidhi himself said, when it comes to the hadiths that encourage virtuous deeds in general, and supplications (du‘a’s) in particular, the matter is flexible, and the scholars usually took a lenient approach towards their isnads.\nIn al-Mustadrak it was narrated that ‘Abd ar-Rahman ibn Mahdi said: If we narrated a report from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that speaks about what is halal and haram, or about rulings, we are strict in examining its isnad and its narrators. But if we narrate hadiths that speak of the virtue of various deeds, reward and punishment, permissible matters and supplications, we are lenient in examining their isnads.\nAl-Mustadrak ‘ala as-Sahihayn (1/666).\nAl-Qadi Abu Ya‘la (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated from Imam Ahmad that he said: When we narrate [reports] from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that speak of halal and haram, we are very stringent in examining the isnads. But when we narrate reports from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that speak of the virtue of various deeds and reports that do not affirm or abrogate a ruling, we are lenient in examining the isnads.""(Tabaqat al-Hanabilah\xa01/425).\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: We have previously noted that the scholars are agreed that one may act on a da‘if hadith that speaks of righteous deeds, but not matters of halal and haram.""(Al-Majmu‘ Sharh al-Muhadhdhab\xa0 3/248).\nAl-Hattab said: Even though this is da‘if, the scholars are agreed that it is permissible to act in accordance with a da‘if hadith that speaks of the virtue of a particular deed.""(Mawahib al-Jalil\xa0 1/17).\nIbn Hajar al-Haytami (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The scholars are unanimously agreed that it is permissible to act in accordance with a da‘if hadith that speaks of the virtue of a deed, because if it turns out to be sahih, then the one who accepted it will have acted as is required, and if it does not turn out to be sahih, there will be no negative consequences for having acted upon it, such as making something haram halal and vice versa, and there will be no transgression against the rights of others.""(Al-Fath al-Mubin bi Sharh al-Arba‘in\xa0 p. 109).\nThe claim that there is unanimous scholarly agreement on this issue is not accurate, as we have stated previously that the scholars differed in the conditions that they stipulated for acting in accordance with a da‘if hadith (question no. 44877 ).\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: When it comes to hadiths in which there is some weakness, it is either due to a narrator whose memory was poor, or a narrator who has committed some mischief, or other, similar reasons for which it was said that his hadith is da‘if. A da‘if hadith may be quoted by scholars in the context of encouraging people to do righteous deeds that are established and well-known in Islamic teachings, such as the da‘if hadiths that speak of giving charity, because charity is something that is well-known in Islamic teachings, there are verses of the Quran which highlight the importance of charity, and there are sahih hadiths which speak about it. So if there are some da‘if hadiths which speak about the virtue of charity, the scholars quote them. The same applies if there are da‘if hadiths which speak about the virtue of supererogatory (nafil) prayers, or about the virtue of tasbih (saying Subhan Allah (Glory be to Allah)) and tahlil (saying La ilaha illa Allah (there is no god worthy of worship except Allah)), and of dhikr. All these matters are established and well-known in Islamic teachings, so the scholars may be lenient regarding da‘if hadiths that speak of them, because the original deeds of which the da‘if hadiths speak are rooted in the Quran and Sunnah, and because acts of worship that are mentioned in da‘if hadiths are already well known from the Quran and Sunnah.""(shaykh’s website).\nSecondly:\nWith regard to the issue of repeating the dhikr mentioned in the question – “Subhan alladhi yusabbih ur-ra‘du bi hamdihi ...” –\nIt is clear from the action of Ka‘b and the approval of ‘Umar and Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them all) that he used to say it three times.\nAnd it is proven from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that it is recommended to repeat supplications three times. When he offered supplication, he would say it three times, and when he asked of Allah, he would ask three times.\nBased on that, if this dhikr is repeated three times, that is good.\nIf he repeats it every time he hears thunder, what appears to be the case is that there is nothing wrong with that, as it is proven that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would sometimes repeat a supplication more than three times. It was narrated that Jarir ibn ‘Abdillah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) blessed the horses of (the tribe of) Ahmas and their men five times. Al-Bukhari (4099).\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This indicates that he used to repeat supplications an odd number of times, and he sometimes repeated them more than three times. This is an exception to the general meaning of the words of Anas, “When he offered supplication, he would repeat it three times.” That is to be understood as referring to what he usually did, and when he said it more than three times, there must have been a reason which dictated that he should say it more than three times. This is clear in the case of the tribe of Ahmas, because of their efforts in standing up to disbelief and supporting Islam, especially with regard to their own people to whom they belonged.""(Fath al-Bari by Ibn Hajar\xa0 8/73-74).\nSo if there is a reason for repeating it, such as if the reason for saying the dhikr is repeated, then there is nothing wrong with repeating it.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/477478/should-the-supplication-for-hearing-thunder-be-repeated-if-the-thunder-is-continuous
10843,Can we call people who do Shirk and Bid`ah Muslims?,"['Praise be to Allah.This question involves two issues, Bid`ah (innovation) and Shirk (polytheism, association of others with Allah).\xa0\n\nBid`ah\n\nThis issue may be divided into three topics:\n\nDefinition of Bid`ah\nCategories of Bid`ah\nRulings on one who commits Bid`ah – does that make him a disbeliever or not?\xa0\n\nWhat is Bid`ah?\nShaykh Muhammad ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“According to Shari`ah, the definition of Bid`ah is `Worshipping Allah in ways that Allah has not prescribed.’ If you wish you may say, `Worshipping Allah in ways that are not those of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) or his rightly guided Caliphs.’”\xa0\nThe first definition is taken from the verse (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Or have they partners with Allah (false gods) who have instituted for them a religion which Allah has not ordained?”\xa0 [Ash-Shura 42:21]\xa0\nThe second definition is taken from the Hadith of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), who said:\n“I urge you to adhere to my way (Sunnah) and the way of the rightly-guided Caliphs who come after me. Hold fast to it and bite onto it with your eyeteeth [i.e., cling firmly to it], and beware of newly-invented matters.”\xa0\nSo everyone who worships Allah in a manner that Allah has not prescribed or in a manner that is not in accordance with the way of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) or his rightly-guided Caliphs, is an innovator, whether that innovated worship has to do with the names and attributes of Allah, or to do with His rulings and laws.\xa0\nWith regard to ordinary matters of habit and custom, these are not called Bid`ah (innovation) in Islam, even though they may be described as such in linguistic terms. But they are not innovations in the religious sense, and these are not the things that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was warning us against.\xa0\nAnd there is no such thing in Islam as Bid`ah hasanah (good innovation).”\xa0(Majmu` Fatawa Ibn `Uthaymin, vol. 2, p. 291)\xa0\nCategories of Bid`ah\xa0\nBid`ah may be divided into two categories:\xa0\n\nBid`ah which constitutes disbelief\xa0\xa0\nBid`ah which does not constitute disbelief\xa0\n\nBid`ah which constitutes disbelief\xa0\n\xa0If you ask, what is the definition of Bid`ah which constitutes disbelief and that which does not constitute disbelief?\xa0\nThe answer is:\xa0\nShaykh Hafith Al-Hakami (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“The kind of Bid`ah which constitutes disbelief is when one denies a matter on which there is scholarly consensus, which is widely-known, and which no Muslim can have any excuse for not knowing, such as denying something that is obligatory, making something obligatory that is not obligatory, or making something prohibited permissible, or making something permissible prohibited; or believing some notion about Allah, His Messenger and His Book when they are far above that, whether in terms of denial of affirmation\xa0 – because that means disbelieving in the Quran and in the message with which Allah sent His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).\xa0\nExamples include the Bid`ah of the Jahmiyyah, who denied the attributes of Allah; or the notion that the Quran was created; or the notion that some of the attributes of Allah were created; or the Bid`ah of the Qadariyyah\xa0 who denied the knowledge and actions of Allah; or the Bid`ah of the Mujassimah who likened Allah to His creation… etc.\xa0\nBid`ah which does not constitute disbelief\xa0\nThe second category, Bid`ah which does not constitute disbelief, is defined as that which does not imply rejection of the Quran or of anything with which Allah sent His messengers.\xa0\nExamples include the Marwani Bid`ahs (which were denounced by the greatest Companions (who did not approve of them, although they did not denounce them as disbelievers or refuse to give them Bay`ah because of that), such as delaying some of the prayers until the end of the due times, doing the ‘Eid Khutbah before the ‘Eid prayer, delivering the Khutbah whilst sitting down on Fridays, etc.” (Ma`arij Al-Qubul, 2/503-504)\xa0\nCan you call one who commits Bid`ah\xa0 a disbeliever?\xa0\nThe answer is that it depends.\xa0\nIf the Bid`ah constitutes disbelief, then the person is one of the following two types:\xa0\n\nEither it is known that his intention is to destroy the foundations of Islam and make the Muslims doubt it. Such a person is definitely a disbeliever; indeed, he is a stranger to Islam and is one of the enemies of the faith.\nOr he is deceived and confused; he cannot be denounced as a disbeliever until proof is established against him, fair and square.\xa0\n\nIf the Bid`ah does not constitute disbelief, then he should not be denounced as a disbeliever. Rather, he remains a Muslim, but he has done a gravely evil action.\xa0\nHow should we deal with those who commit Bid`ah?\xa0\nThe answer is:\xa0\nShaykh Muhammad ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“In both cases, we have to call these people – who claim to be Muslim but who commit acts of Bid`ah which may constitute disbelief or may be less than that – to the truth, by explaining the truth without being hostile or condemning what they are doing. But once we know that they are too arrogant to accept the truth – for Allah says (interpretation of the meaning), `And insult not those whom they (disbelievers) worship besides Allah, lest they insult Allah wrongfully without knowledge.’ [Al-An`am 6:108] – if we find out that they are stubborn and arrogant, then we should point out their falsehood, because then pointing out their falsehood becomes an obligation upon us.\xa0\nWith regard to boycotting them, that depends upon the Bid`ah. If it is a Bid`ah which constitutes disbelief, then it is obligatory to boycott the person who does it. If it is of a lesser degree than that, then it is essential to examine the situation further. If something may be achieved by boycotting the person, then we do it; if no purpose will be served by it, or if it will only make him more disobedient and arrogant, then we should avoid doing that, because whatever serves no purpose, it is better not to do it. And also in principle it is impermissible to boycott a believer, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: `It is not permissible for a man to forsake [not speak to] his brother for more than three [days].’”\xa0(Adapted from Majmu` Fatawa Ibn `Uthaymin, vol. 2, p. 293)\xa0\n\nShirk, its types and the definition of each\xa0\n\nTypes of Shirk\nShaykh Muhammad ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Shirk is of two types, major Shirk which puts a person beyond the pale of Islam, and minor Shirk .”\xa0\n\nThe first type, major Shirk , is “Every type of Shirk which the Lawgiver described as such and which puts a person beyond the pale of his religion” – such as devoting any kind of act of worship which should be for Allah to someone other than Allah, such as praying to anyone other than Allah, fasting for anyone other than Allah or offering a sacrifice to anyone other than Allah. It is also a form of major Shirk to offer supplication (Du`a) to anyone other than Allah, such as calling upon the occupant of a grave or calling upon one who is absent to help one in some way in which no one is able to help except Allah.\xa0\nThe second type is minor Shirk , which means every kind of speech or action that Islam describes as Shirk, but it does not put a person beyond the pale of Islam – such as swearing an oath by something other than Allah, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said that whoever swears an oath by something other than Allah is guilty of disbelief or Shirk .\n\nThe one who swears an oath by something other than Allah but does not believe that anyone other than Allah has the same greatness as Allah, is a Mushrik who is guilty of lesser Shirk, regardless of whether the one by whom he swore is venerated by people or not. It is not permissible to swear by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), or by the president, or by the Ka`bah, or by Jibril, because this is Shirk, but it is minor Shirk which does not put a person beyond the pale of Islam.\xa0\nAnother type of minor Shirk is showing off, which means that a person does something so that people will see it, not for the sake of Allah.\xa0\nImpact of showing off on acts of worship\nThe ways in which showing off may cancel out acts of worship are either of the following:\xa0\n\nThe first is when it is applied to an act of worship from the outset, i.e., the person is not doing that action for any reason other than showing off. In this case, the action is invalid and is rejected, because of the Hadith of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) which was attributed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), which says that Allah said, “I am so Self-sufficient that I am in no need of having an associate. Thus he who does an action for someone else’s sake as well as Mine will have that action renounced by Me to him whom he associated with Me.” (Narrated by Muslim, Kitaab Az-Zuhd, 2985)\xa0\nThe second is when the showing off happens later on during the act of worship, i.e., the action is originally for Allah, then showing off creeps into it. This may be one of two cases:\xa0\n\nThe first is when the person resists it – this does not harm him.\nFor example, a man has prayed a Rak`ah, then some people come along during his second Rak`ah and it occurs to him to make the Ruku` or Sujud longer, or makes himself weep, and so on. If he resists that, it does not harm him, because he is striving against this idea. But if he goes along with that, then every action which stemmed from showing off is invalid, such as if he made his standing or prostration long, or he made himself weep – all of those actions will be cancelled out. But does this invalidation extend to the entire act of worship or not?\xa0\nWe say that either of the following must apply:\xa0\n\nEither the end of his act of worship was connected to the beginning (with no pause); so if the end of it is invalidated then all of it is invalidated.\n\nThis is the case with the prayer – the last part of it cannot be invalidated without the first part also being invalidated, so the whole prayer is invalid.\n\nOr if the beginning of the action is separate from the end of it, then the first part is valid but the latter part is not. Whatever came before the showing off is valid, and what came after it is not valid.\xa0\n\nAn example of that is a man who has a hundred Riyals, and gives fifty of them in charity for the sake of Allah with a sound intention, then he gives fifty in charity for the purpose of showing off. The first fifty are accepted, and the second fifty are not accepted, because the latter is separate from the former.” (Majmu` Fatawa wa Rasa’il Ibn `Uthaymin, and Al-Qawl Al-Mufid Sharh Kitab Al-Tawhid, vol. 1, p. 114, 1st\xa0edition)\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10843/categories-of-bidah-and-shirk
378208,"Is it permissible for a woman who is living on her own, with no one else, to keep a dog for protection in her apartment? She has no option but to keep the dog inside the apartment for the purpose of protection. What is the ruling? Will the angels refuse to enter the house or not? What is the rule on praying, if the angels refuse to enter the house? If we allocate a specific room that the dog cannot enter, will the angels enter that room, or will they refuse to enter the house altogether?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nRuling on keeping dogs\nIt is not permissible to keep dogs , except a dog for hunting or guarding livestock or guarding crops.\nThe evidence for that is the report narrated by al-Bukhari (2145) from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever keeps a dog, one or two qirats will be deducted from his good deeds every day, except a dog for guarding the crops or guarding livestock.\nMuslim (2974) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever keeps a dog, except a dog for hunting or guarding livestock or land, two qirats will be deducted from his reward every day.”\nAnd Muslim (2943) narrated from ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: Whoever keeps a dog, except a dog for guarding livestock or a dog for hunting, a qirat will be deducted from his good deeds each day.” ‘Abdullah said: Abu Hurayrah said: Or a dog for guarding crops.\nSecondly:\nDifference of scholarly opinion regarding the permissibility of keeping a dog for purposes other than hunting or guarding livestock and crops\nThe scholars differed regarding keeping dogs for purposes other than these three, such as keeping them to protect houses and their occupants. Most of the scholars say that this is permissible, and that is more likely to be correct.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: There is a difference of scholarly opinion regarding the permissibility of keeping dogs for purposes other than these three, such as protecting houses and roads. The more correct view is that it is permissible, by analogy with these three, because of the reason implied in the hadith, which is if there is a need for that.""(Sharh Muslim\xa0 10/236).\nThat is if there is a need to protect the house, but the fact that a woman is living alone in the house does not on its own justify keeping a dog, unless she fears for herself because she is living in a remote area, or because she has no neighbours around her, and so on, and having a dog with her will serve the purpose of protection, and it will not just be company for her or something that is done for fun.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Based on that, if the house is in the middle of the city, there is no need to have a dog to guard it, so keeping a dog for this purpose in this situation is haram and is not permissible, and it will detract one or two qirats from the reward of its owners every day. So they should get rid of the dog and not keep it. But if the house is in the wilderness, with no one around, then it is permissible to keep a dog to guard the house and the people in it, because it is more important to guard the people of the household than to guard flocks and crops.""(Majmu‘ Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymin\xa04/246).\nThirdly:\nIf there is a need to have a dog and keep it inside the house\nIf there is a need to have a dog and keep it inside the house, it should be in its own room, so as to protect the house from being contaminated with impurity (najasah). That will not prevent the angels from entering the rest of the house, in sha Allah, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The angels do not enter a room in which there are images.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (5961) and Muslim (2104).\xa0\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If the image is haram, then what appears to be the case – and Allah knows best – is that if it is in one room, that does not include the entire house, especially if the people of the household do not approve of having these images in the house, because in some families there may be one person who has been misled by the devils, so he collects images and keeps them with him or hangs them on the walls, and the other family members dislike that but cannot stop him from doing it. In this case, if the other family members dislike that, the angels will not refrain from entering the house.\nAs for a room in which there are images, the angels do not enter a room in which there are images.""(Liqa’ al-Bab al-Maftuh\xa0 75/28).\nIn the case of a dog which it is permissible to keep, that does not prevent the angels from entering the room where it is, according to the correct view.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: al-Khattabi said: The angels only refrain from entering the room in which there is a dog or image when it is haram to keep that dog or image. But if the dog or image is not haram – such as dogs for hunting, and guarding crops and livestock, and images that are not treated with respect, as they are on rugs, pillows and the like – the angels do not refrain from entering because of that. Al-Qadi referred to something similar to what al-Khattabi said.""(Sharh Muslim\xa014/84).\nIt says in Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah (26/163): The fact that the angels do not enter a house in which there is a dog or an image is narrated in as-Sahihayn. My question is: If someone keeps a dog for a necessary reason, such as guarding chickens, what does Islam say about that?\nAnswer: If someone keeps a dog for hunting or guarding, that is permissible for him, so it does not prevent the angels from entering the house.\n‘Abdullah ibn Ghadyan, Abd ar-Razzaq ‘Afifi, ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn ‘Abdillah ibn Baz. End quote.\nConclusion:\nIf there is a need for protection, for fear of thieves and the like, and there is no alternative but to keep the dog in the apartment, there is nothing wrong with that.

134621,"I would like to learn about the Sunnah of doing business. How did the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) do business? How did he describe products, exchange them, return them, and so on?","['Praise be to Allah.Prophet Muhammad’s advice on business\nWe can sum up the teachings of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) with regard to doing business, buying and selling, as follows:\xa0\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) worked in business before his mission began, with his paternal uncle Abu Talib, and he also worked for Khadijah (may Allah be pleased with her), and he travelled for that purpose to greater Syria. He also did business in the markets; Majannah and ‘Ukath were markets during the Jahiliyyah [the pre-Islamic era] to which merchants would come to buy and sell.\xa0\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to engage directly in transactions himself, as we shall see below in the Hadith about the camel of ‘Umar and the camel of Jabir (may Allah be pleased with them both). He also used to appoint one of his companions to do that for him, as in the case of ‘Urwah ibn Abu Al-Ja‘d Al-Bariqi (may Allah be pleased with him), who said that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) gave him a Dinar to buy a sacrificial animal or a sheep for him. He bought two sheep and sold one for a Dinar, and he came back with a sheep and a Dinar. He (the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) prayed for blessing for him in his business dealings, and (after that) if he had bought dust he would have made a profit.\xa0(Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 1258; Abu Dawood, 3384; Ibn Majah, 2402; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Tirmidhi.)\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to enjoin traders to be righteous and honest and to give charity.\xa0\nIt was narrated that Hakim ibn Hizam (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The two parties to a transaction have the option (of cancelling it) until they part. If they are honest and disclose any defects, their transaction will be blessed, but if they lie and conceal defects the blessing of their transaction will be erased.”\xa0(Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 1973 and Muslim, 1532)\xa0\nIt was narrated from Isma`il ibn `Ubayd ibn Rifa`ah from his father from his grandfather that he went out with the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to the prayer place, and he saw the people engaging in trade. He said:\xa0 “O merchants!” and they responded to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), craning their necks and looking up at him. He (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him said, “The merchants will be raised on the Day of Resurrection as evildoers, apart from those who fear Allah and are sincere and honest.”\xa0(Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 1210; Ibn Majah, 2146; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Targhib, 1785).\xa0\nIt was narrated that Qays ibn Abu Gharazah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to say: “O merchants, selling involves idle talk and oaths, so mix it with Sadaqah (charity).”\xa0(Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 1208; Abu Dawood, 3326; An-Nasa’i, 3797; Ibn Majah, 2145; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawood.)\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to enjoin people to be tolerant and easy-going in buying and selling .\xa0\nIt was narrated from Jabir ibn ‘Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “May Allah have mercy upon a man who is easy-going when he sells and when he buys and when he asks for payment.”\xa0(Al-Bukhari, 1970)\xa0\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“In this Hadith it is encouraged to be easy-going in transactions, to have the most sublime of attitudes, and to avoid miserliness, and it is encouraged to avoid putting pressure on people when asking for payment, and to take from them what they can afford.” (Fath Al-Bari, 4/307)\xa0\nExamples of the tolerance and easy-going nature of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) include the following:\xa0\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 It was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: We were with the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on a journey, and I was riding on a recalcitrant young camel belonging to ‘Umar. It kept getting the better of me and kept going ahead of the people, so ‘Umar kept checking and making it go back. Then it went on ahead and ‘Umar checked it and made it go back. Then the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Sell it to me.” He said: It is yours, O Messenger of Allah. He said: “Sell it to me.” So he sold it to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “It is yours, O ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar; do with it whatever you will.”\xa0(Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 2610)\xa0\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 It was narrated from Jabir ibn ‘Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) that he was riding on a camel of his that had become exhausted to the point that he wanted to let it go. He said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) caught up with me and offered supplication for me, and he hit it and the camel started moving (energetically) as I had never seen it move before. He said: “Sell it to me for one Uqiyah.” I said: No. He (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Sell it to me.” So I sold it to him for one Uqiyah and stipulated that I be allowed to ride it home. When I arrived I brought the camel to him, and he gave me its price, then I left. He sent someone after me and said: “Did you think that I bargained with you in order to take away your camel? Take your camel and its price; they are both yours.”\xa0(Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 1991 and Muslim, 715)\xa0\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to give people their rights and urge others to do likewise.\xa0\nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: A man was owed a camel of a certain age by the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), so he came to him to ask him to repay him, and he said: “Give him.” They looked, but they could not find anything but a camel that was older than his, so he said: “Give him.” He said: You have paid me back in full, may Allah reward you. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Verily the best of you are those who are the best in paying off debts.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 2182 and Muslim, 1601)\xa0\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to urge people to let a buyer cancel the transaction if he regrets it.\xa0\nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever lets a Muslim off (a transaction), Allah will relieve him of his distress on the Day of Resurrection.”\xa0(Narrated by Abu Dawud, 3460 and Ibn Majah, 2199; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud)\xa0\nLetting someone off means being easy-going and agreeing to cancel a sale or purchase; it is indicative of generosity of spirit.\xa0\nWhat is meant by letting someone off a sale is: if someone buys something from a man, then regrets his purchase, either because he feels that he did not get a good deal, or because he no longer has any need of it, or because he does not have the wherewithal to pay for it, so he returns the item to the seller and the seller agrees to take it back, Allah will remove his hardship and distress on the Day of Resurrection, because of his kindness towards the buyer, because the transaction has been finalised, so the purchaser could not cancel it."" (`Awn Al-Ma`bud)\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to bargain with people when buying , but he would not go so far as to undermine the real value of the item, as we have seen above in the Hadith about the camel of Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him).\xa0\nIt was narrated that Suwayd ibn Qays (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Makhramah Al-`Abdi and I brought some garments from Hajar to Makkah. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came to us on foot and bargained with us for some trousers, and we sold them to him. (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 1305 – he said: it is authentic. Also narrated by Abu Dawud, 3336, An-Nasa\'i, 4592 and Ibn Majah, 2220)\xa0\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to urge people to give a little more when weighing.\xa0\nIt was narrated that Suwayd ibn Qays (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) saw a man who weighed things for a fee and the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to him: “Weigh and give a little more.”\xa0\nThis is the continuation of the Hadith quoted above.\xa0\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to enjoin people to give more time for a debtor who is in financial difficulty, or to waive the debt.\xa0\nIt was narrated that Abu Al-Yasar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever waits for one who is in (financial) difficulty (to pay a debt) or waives it for him, Allah will shade him in His shade.”\xa0(Narrated by Muslim, 3006)\xa0\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade transactions involving Riba (usury) , transactions involving ambiguity, ‘Einah transaction [which involve selling something for a price to be paid at a later date, then buying it back from the same person who bought it for a lower price to be paid immediately], dealing in prohibited things, and cheating and deception.\xa0\nThe evidence for that is abundant and well-known.\xa0\nHow did Prophet Muhammad run his business?\nWe do not have details on his buying and selling in all of his commercial transactions, because his (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) trading was done during the Jahiliyyah, when he was not yet a Prophet such that his actions would be transmitted from his companions. But what has been narrated of his Sunnah is sufficient, in sha Allah.\nFor more details, please see this category: Business and Financial Transactions\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/134621/what-prophet-muhammad-said-about-business
