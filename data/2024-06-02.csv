258254,"There is a girl in my locality, who holds following beliefes","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThere are some positive aspects to this girl which we must point out. Her pride in Islam is something praiseworthy, as is her keenness to belong to Islam, her admiration of its values, and her commitment to its teachings, such as the hijab for example, whether she calls it modern Islam or some other name. It does not matter what she calls it if she can understand the concept behind that name in a proper manner, far removed from the influence of emotions that young people usually feel, and far away from extreme ideas that result from the crisis that the Muslim ummah is going through in reaction to the domination of modernity.\nSecondly:\nThere is a difference in approach between talking to an older woman who has gone through a lot of life experiences, and has read, heard and researched things, until she formed a certain conviction that what she believes is sound and it is very difficult for her to change her views – rather she strives to defend them –\nand talking to a young girl of sixteen, who does not have enough knowledge, education or life experience to her credit; rather she is still at the stage of growth and development, and has not yet reached the age of maturity and her ideas are not yet fully formed, and she has formed whatever ideas she has on the basis of limited experience, or merely listening to one experience of someone else, or imitating a particular person.\nSuch ideas and thoughts that accumulate and dominate the mind of a person when he is physically and intellectually immature will quickly change, the more intellectually mature the person becomes and the more he goes through life experiences and increases in knowledge.\nBased on that: it is important to differentiate between the ideas of this young woman, some of which are acceptable and some are to be rejected or, more precisely, between general ideas that have nothing to do with religious principles – rather they are personal impressions that are subject to change as the person gains more experience – and religious concepts or beliefs which could have an impact on the fundamentals of religion.\nHer idea that women are superior in terms of energy and hard work, and her dislike of the idea that there is natural attraction between the sexes, and her suggesting that men should participate in cooking and preparation of food, are all matters that do not reach the level of beliefs or doctrines, as you mentioned at the beginning of your question. That is because they are no more than passing thoughts and personal desires that she chooses for herself and her evaluation of some permissible deeds. There is nothing wrong with her thinking about the women around her as being more active, working harder and serving others in a manner that is superior to what she sees from the men, whether they are other female students who outperform the male students – which is something that happens often – or she sees that among some outstanding women around her. That could very well be the case, and there is no doubt about it, but to be fair, we should note that women surpassing men is something rare, because if we look at men and women together as a whole, we will see that men do surpass women with regard to working hard and being active and energetic. The reality of people’s lives attests to that.\nLook at all nations of the world, advanced or otherwise: how many female presidents are there, how many female prime ministers, how many female ministers, how many female CEOs of large corporations or major companies, and so on?\nYou will undoubtedly find some women in such positions, but they are very few when compared with the number of men in such positions.\nThis fact is an affirmation that you will find in all peoples in the world, despite the differences in their religions and cultures. This confirms that men are more capable than women of successfully performing in these high positions, and that is the natural disposition that Allah has instilled in people.\nAlso look at inventors, explorers, scholars and scientists throughout all of human history, which is not limited to the Muslims alone; what is the ratio of women to men?\nUndoubtedly it is very small, and women in such roles are rare.\nWomen who are superior to some men do exist, and that cannot be denied, but their numbers are very few. This idea, in this sense, is not contrary to Islam at all. Some of the scholars have clearly stated that.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf you say: “Men are better than women,” that does not mean that each individual man is superior to each individual woman. Rather what is meant is that this category in general terms is superior to that category, even though there may be individual women who are superior to some men.""(Al-Usul min ‘Ilm al-Usul\xa0 p.36).\nSomething similar was stated in Fawatih al-Rahamut (p. 1/440).\nSomething similar may be said about her idea that men are interested in women’s bodies, and she hates men because of their gender. We do not think that these are “beliefs”, as you called them at the beginning of your question. They are not beliefs or principles of any significance or any religious dimension. Rather they are only feelings or emotions which your friend is expressing without thinking. The cause of that – as appears to be the case – is some painful experiences that she has lived through, or some unpleasant scenes or experiences that she faced or heard about, which led to her forming these impressions and phobias regarding these matters.\nOr perhaps that stems from some inner desire, such as thinking highly of herself or seeking to elevate herself and try to rise above her imagined weaknesses. These are just thoughts and aspirations that many people have, especially at a young age and at the time of adolescence.\nAll of this is something that may change, or at least is something that is changeable with the first successful or beneficial experience she goes through. Her situation may easily improve with more education in the wider world beyond her narrow surroundings, so she will see the wisdom behind human integration between the male and female genders, which goes beyond the short-lived sexual dimension to an intangible spiritual dimension based on values that result from this integration between the sexes, as the Lord of Glory, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And of His signs is that He created for you from yourselves mates that you may find tranquillity in them; and He placed between you affection and mercy. Indeed in that are signs for a people who give thought}\xa0[ar-Rum 30:21].\nThis mistaken view, even though it is held by some women, is something that we hope will change soon, before it affects the personal life of this young woman and she causes some harm to herself which she will regret when regret will not benefit her.\nWhat will help her to change her point of view – in addition to what we have mentioned above – is noting that the majority of women of different cultures and religions do not think in that way – because it is contrary to human nature. The evidence for that is the fact that the number of married women is always greater than the number of unmarried women; moreover, many of these unmarried women – in fact most of them – are not happy with their situation, and each of them wishes that she was a mother or had a family.\nAs for her talking about the situation of women in secular countries, the reason for that, in our view, is twofold:\nFirstly, it stems from lack of knowledge (ignorance) of the status of women in Islamic teachings, the high esteem in which woman is held in Islam, the recognition of her rights, how Islam protects her dignity and instructs men to treat women kindly and not to mistreat them. Rather she is looking at some Muslim societies which may go against the teachings of Islam and mistreat and oppress women. Islam has nothing to do with that; rather these are mistakes and the responsibility for them rests with the one who does that and he is the one who will be brought to account for it. Such things should not be attributed to Islam.\nSecondly: it stems from not looking at the real situation in society in the light of official numbers and precise statistics which describe what women are going through in those secular societies, and from being deceived by some apparent freedoms for women that this girl sees here and there. In this regard, it is sufficient to draw this girl’s attention to the international acknowledgement of incidents of sexual harassment, rape and appalling sexual exploitation, news of which has reached everywhere and people everywhere talk about it, to the extent that there are reports that half of British women have faced sexual harassment of different types, according to the BBC.\nIf you look, fairly and objectively at the following statistics, you will realize that the matter is more subtle and deeper than may appear at first to be case:\n1.. 10.4 million families in America are headed by single mothers who are the sole providers for their families, according to the US Census Bureau.\n2.. More than one million children are killed by abortion every year in the United States of America, according to the American government Centers for Disease Control.\n3.. 683,000 women annually are subjected to rape in America, at a rate of seventy-eight women per hour, as stated by the American Department of Justice.\n4.. 1320 women are killed annually, meaning that approximately four women are killed every day, by their husbands or boyfriends in America.\n5.. Approximately three million women every year in America are subject to physical abuse from a husband or boyfriend. Source: the official government website of the State of New Jersey.\n6.. 22.1% of women in America are subjected to physical abuse by a husband or boyfriend (current or former), according to the US Department of Justice.\n7.. A report issued by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics confirms that most women in the West work in low-wage and low status jobs, and despite the pressure that the government exerts to improve women’s jobs, 97% of higher leadership positions in most companies are occupied by men.\n8.. 78% of women in the armed forces are subjected to sexual harassment from military employees.\n9.. In America, a woman’s body is a commodity that is traded to the extent that women are treated like animals. The aim of that is mere sexual pleasure, to the extent that some widely known restaurants there serve food on the naked bodies of women, and some car washes offer car washing services done by naked women, and waitresses serve coffee in one of the most famous restaurants wearing bikinis, as was published in major American newspapers such as the New York Times (18-4-2007, 24-8-2008, etc).\n10.. Approximately fifty thousand women and girls are trafficked into the United States every year, where they are enslaved and forced into prostitution, according to the New York Times.\n11.. Exploitation of women’s bodies in various permissive ways is an industry that brings in twelve billion dollars annually in America alone, according to a report on www.reuters.com\n12.. Half of American women above the age of seventy-five years live alone, as noted by the American Census Bureau.\n13.. Women were not given the right to vote in America until 1920 CE.\n14.. According to a study carried out in fourteen countries, it was shown that 42% of British people admit having illicit relationships with more than one person at the same time, whilst half of Americans have illicit relationships. The rate in Italy is 38% and in France it is 36%, according to the BBC.\nThere is an almost endless list of dark, hidden pages which speak of the situation of women in materialistic Western civilisation, all of which have been documented on official Western websites which constitute trustworthy and reliable sources for such statistics.\nPlease see the statistics on www.alukah.net\nWith regard to her view on jihad, it is a mistaken view, the source of which is ignorance of the rulings on jihad in Islam and the wisdom behind its prescription.\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Goodness is tied to the forelocks of horses until the Day of Resurrection: reward and booty.”\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The booty that is associated with reward is only acquired by means of fighting on horses in jihad.""(Fath al-Bari\xa0 6/56).\nThis hadith clearly indicates that jihad will continue until the Day of Resurrection. On our website there are many questions about the rulings on jihad; please find them under the heading Jihad and Hijrah (migration).\nThese are some ideas which we believe will help you to advise this girl.\nBut we recommend you to let your advice to her be simply to tell her to refer to this question, or print it out for her.\nAs for talking to her, when you are a young man and she is a girl, we think that this is something that could open the door to temptation, so you must close that door and not open it, because it may lead to something that is bad for you and her.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/258254/she-thinks-that-islam-is-not-suited-to-the-modern-woman
109280,"For how long is it obligatory to stay in Mina after offering the sacrifice? There is a verse concerning that which says (interpretation of the meaning): “But whosoever hastens to leave in two days, there is no sin on him and whosoever stays on, there is no sin on him, if his aim is to do good and obey Allah (fear Him), and know that you will surely be gathered unto Him” [Al-Baqarah 2:203]","['Praise be to Allah.The Standing Committee for Academic Research and Issuing Fatwas states:\xa0\n“The period for which the pilgrim must stay in Mina after the day of Sacrifice is two days, namely the 11th\xa0and 12th\xa0of Dhul-Hijjah .

47289,A woman did Hajj a few years ago. She entered Ihram from the Miqat and did Tawaf and Sa`i whilst she was menstruating (I do not know whether she did that out of ignorance). I hope that you can advise us whatever the case. Then she did `Umrah after that several times. What is the ruling?,"['Praise be to Allah.It is not essential to be free of menses in order to enter Ihram and do Sa`i , but the menstruating woman is not allowed to do Tawaf around the House until she is pure.\xa0\nBased on this, a woman who wants to do Hajj or `Umrah should enter Ihram from the Miqat even if she is menstruating, and she should form the intention of entering Ihram.\xa0\nThe evidence for that is the fact that Asma’ bint `Umays, the wife of Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) gave birth, when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was camped at Dhul-Hulayfah (which is the Miqat for the people of Madinah), on his way to do Hajj. She sent word to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asking him what she should do. He said: “Do Ghusl and tie a piece of cloth around yourself and enter Ihram.”\xa0\nWhat is meant by tying a piece of cloth is placing a piece of cloth over the vagina and tying it in place, then entering Ihram whether for Hajj or `Umrah. The blood of menstruation is like the blood of childbirth, so when the menstruating woman reaches the Miqat, she should do Ghusl and tie a piece of cloth around herself, and enter Ihram, in accordance with this Hadith.\xa0\nSimilarly Sa`i between As-Safa and Al-Marwah done by a menstruating woman is valid, but her Tawaf is not valid .\xa0\nThe evidence for that is that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her), when she menstruated during `Umrah: “Do everything that the pilgrims do, but do not circumambulate the House until you become pure .” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 1650 and Muslim, 1211)\xa0\nBased on this, then this woman did not go through the second stage of exiting Ihram for Hajj , so she has to repeat the Tawaf, and her husband should not have intercourse with her, if she is married, until she has done Tawaf.\xa0\nThis is the ruling on this issue, whether she did that knowingly or unknowingly. But if she did that knowingly then she sinned by doing this prohibited action with no excuse. But if she was unaware, then there is no sin on her. But she has to do this Tawaf and she has not gone through the second stage of exiting Ihram until she does it, as stated above. The fact that she did `Umrah several times after that does not relieve her of the obligation to do this Tawaf.\xa0\nThe Standing Committee was asked about the Hajj of a menstruating woman. They said:\xa0\n“A menstruating woman is not prevented from doing Hajj. The one who enters Ihram when she is menstruating may do all the actions of Hajj, but she should not circumambulate the House until her period ends and she does Ghusl. The same applies to a woman who is bleeding following childbirth. If she does all the essential parts of Hajj then her Hajj is valid.”\xa0(Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 11/172)\xa0\nShaykh Muhammad ibn Salih ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about a woman who entered the Haram and did Tawaf and prayed when she was menstruating.\xa0\nHe said:\xa0\n“It is not permissible for a woman who is menstruating or bleeding following childbirth to pray, whether in Makkah or in her own country or anywhere else, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Is it not the case that when she is menstruating she does not pray or fast?”\xa0\nMoreover the Muslims unanimously agree that it is not permissible for a menstruating woman to fast or to pray. This woman who did that has to repent to Allah and seek forgiveness for what she did.\xa0\nAs for her Tawaf when she was menstruating, it is not valid, but her Sa`i is valid, because the correct view is that it is permissible to do Sa`i before Tawaf during Hajj. Based on this, she has to repeat the Tawaf, because Tawaf Al-Ifadah is one of the essential parts of Hajj, and the second stage of exiting Ihram cannot be completed without it. Based on that, her husband should not have intercourse with her, if she is married, until she does Tawaf. If she is not married then she cannot get married until she has done this Tawaf.” (Majmu`at Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Muhammad Salih ibn `Uthaymin, 22/382)\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/47289/can-she-perform-umrah-during-menses
182716,"I want to commit suicide, not because I hate this world, but because I long to meet Allah! I cannot wait any longer, even if that means going for jihad. I want to see Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, may His name be honoured and may His attributes be sanctified. Will I go to hell if I commit suicide with the intention of seeing Allah?","['Praise be to Allah.Committing suicide is a major sin, and there is no such thing in Islam as committing suicide with the intention of seeing Allah or drawing close to Him. How can a person draw close to his Lord by doing something that He has forbidden him to do, warned him against it and threatened him with a grievous and painful punishment if he does it?\nIf that were prescribed, then the most beloved of all people to Allah and those with the greatest longing to meet Him, namely the prophets and the righteous, would have done it. So ignore the whispers and intrusive thoughts prompted by the Shaytan and beware of falling into this grievous sin which could deprive you of seeing Allah in the hereafter and take you to the fire of hell, to abide therein forever.\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) stated that the one who commits suicide will be punished on the Day of Resurrection with something like that with which he killed himself.\nIt was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever throws himself down from a mountain and kills himself will be throwing himself down in the Fire of Hell for ever and ever. Whoever drinks poison and kills himself will be sipping it in the in the Fire of Hell for ever and ever. Whoever kills himself with a piece of iron will have that iron in his hand, thrusting it into his belly in the Fire of Hell for ever and ever.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (5442) and Muslim (109).\nIt was narrated from Thabit ibn ad-Dahhak (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever kills himself with something in this world will be punished with it on the Day of Resurrection.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (5700) and Muslim (110).\nIt was narrated that Jundub ibn ‘Abdillah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “A man among those who came before you was wounded. He panicked and took a knife and cut his hand, and the bleeding did not stop until he died. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, said: ‘My slave hastened his death; I have forbidden Paradise to him.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (3276) and Muslim (113).\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) refrained from offering the funeral prayer for one who had committed suicide, as a punishment to him and so as to deter others from doing what he had done. It was narrated that Jaabir ibn Samurah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: A man who had killed himself with a broad arrow-head was brought to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and he did not offer the funeral prayer for him. Narrated by Muslim (978).\nThis hadith is evidence for those who say that the funeral prayer should not be offered for one who killed himself, because of his sin. This is the view of ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Aziz and al-Awza‘i. But al-Hasan, al-Nakha‘i, Qatadah, Malik, Abu Hanifah, ash-Shafa‘i and the majority of scholars said that the funeral prayer should be offered for him. They responded to this hadith by pointing out that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not offer the funeral prayer for him himself, so as to deter the people from doing something similar, but the Sahabah offered the funeral prayer for him.""(Sharh Muslim\xa07/47).\nDrawing close to Allah, may He be exalted, is to be done by means of what He has prescribed; the best of that is doing obligatory duties, then doing supererogatory acts, as mentioned in the hadith narrated by al-Bukhari (6502) from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah says: ‘Whoever takes a close friend of Mine as an enemy, I declare war on him. My slave does not draw closer to Me by anything more beloved to Me than that which I have made obligatory upon him, and My slave continues to draw closer to Me by doing nafl (supererogatory) deeds until I love him, and if I love him, I will be his hearing with which he hears, his vision with which he sees, his hand with which he strikes and his foot with which he walks. If he were to ask of Me, I would surely give to him; if he were to seek refuge with Me, I would surely grant him refuge.”\nWe ask Allah to guide and help you, and to protect you from the evil of your own self and the whispers of the Shaytan.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/182716/he-wants-to-commit-suicide-out-of-haste-and-longing-to-meet-allah
222836,"I want to go – if Allah, may He be Exalted, wills – on the seventh day of Dhul-Hijjah to perform Hajj tamattu` [i.e., `Umrah followed by Hajj, exiting Ihram in between]. What should I say when I begin the rituals? Which is better, to shave the head or cut the hair after doing the sa`i of `Umrah? From where should I enter Ihram for Hajj? Do I have to shave my head on the Day of Sacrifice, after stoning Jamrat Al-`Aqabah?","['Praise be to Allah.What is Hajj Tamattu`?\nHajj Tamattu` means entering Ihram for `Umrah only during the months of Hajj – the months of Hajj are Shawwal, Dhul-Qa`dah and Dhul-Hijjah – so when entering Ihram for it, one should say: “Labbayk `umratan (Here I am in response to your call, I perform `Umrah).”\xa0\nStep-by-Step Guide for Hajj Tamattu`\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said, describing `Umrah of Tammatu`:\xa0\n“When the pilgrim reaches the Miqat, he should do Ghusl as in the case of major impurity, and apply the best perfume he can find to his head and beard, then put on the Ihram garments, an Izar (lower garment) and Rida’ (upper garment). It is preferable for them to be white and clean.\nThen he should say: “Labbayk `umratan (Here I am in response to your call, I perform`Umrah).” There is no need for him to say that he is connecting it to Hajj, exiting Ihram in between, because he has already formed the intention in his heart that he is going to perform Hajj. So he should say: “Labbayk `umratan, Labbayka Allahumma labbayk , labbayka la sharika laka labbayk. Inna Al-hamd wan-ni`mata laka wal Mulk, la sharika lak\xa0 (Here I am in response to your call, I perform`Umrah. Here I am, O Allah, here I am. Here I am, You have no partner, here I am. Verily all praise and blessings are Yours, and all sovereignty, You have no partner).”\xa0\nMen should raise their voices when saying this, and it should be understood that no tree, rock or brick hears him but it will testify on the Day of Resurrection that he said this Talbiyah.\xa0\nWhat the Talbiyah means is responding to Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, because the word “labbayk” means: I am responding to You.\xa0\nHe should continue reciting the Talbiyah until he begins the Tawaf of `Umrah. When he reaches Makkah, he should do Tawaf and Sa`i for `Umrah , shave or cut his hair, and exit his Ihram. Then on the day of At-Tarwiyah, which is the eighth day of Dhul-Hijjah, he should enter Ihram for Hajj only and do all the actions of Hajj. So the one who does tamattu` does a complete `Umrah and a complete Hajj.” (Al-Liqa’ Ash-Shahri)\nWhen to Enter Ihram for Hajj Tamattu`\nThe one who is doing Hajj Tamattu` enters Ihram on the eighth day of Dhul-Hijjah from the place where he is staying. When he enters Ihram for Hajj, he does the same as he did when he entered Ihram for `Umrah, doing Ghusl and putting on perfume. So he should form the intention to enter Ihram for Hajj and say “Labbayka Hajjan (here I am in response to your call, I performHajj)”, then recite the well-known Talbiyah.\xa0\nThe scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas said:\xa0\n“With regard to the one who enters Ihram for `Umrah from the Miqat, intending to follow it with Hajj Tamattu`, when he has done `Umrah he should exit Ihram. There is nothing wrong with him going to Jeddah or elsewhere, then entering Ihram for Hajj from the place where he is staying after doing `Umrah.” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, vol. 2, 10/76-77)\xa0\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“What is prescribed for the pilgrim who is not in Ihram is to enter Ihram on the day of at-Tarwiyah from the place where he is, whether he is inside Makkah or outside, or in Mina, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed those who had exited Ihram after `Umrah to enter Ihram for Hajj on the day of At-Tarwiyah from the places where they were staying.” (Majmu` Fatawa Ibn Baz, 16/140)\nInstructions for Hajj Tamattu` Pilgrims\nAs you are going to do `Umrah on the seventh day (of Dhul-Hijjah), you should cut your hair after finishing `Umrah, and not shave your head, so that some of your hair will remain for you to shave it off during Hajj. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed his companions, during the Farewell Pilgrimage, to cut their hair following `Umrah, because their arrival was on the morning of the fourth day of Dhul-Hijjah. This indicates that cutting the hair in this situation is preferable to shaving, and it is better so that the head can be shaved during Hajj.\xa0\nWhat pilgrims do on the Day of Sacrifice\xa0\nThe actions on the Day of Sacrifice, for the pilgrim who is doing Tamattu` are, in order: stoning Jamrat Al-`Aqabah, offering the sacrifice, shaving the head or cutting the hair, Tawaf Al-Ifadah and Sa`i. This is the best way, because this is what the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did. For more information, please see the answer to question no.\xa0106594 \xa0\nIf the pilgrim does some of them earlier and others later, or he does some of them after the Day of Sacrifice, there is nothing wrong with that.\xa0\nThe scholars unanimously agree that it is permissible to delay shaving the head until the last of the days of At-Tashriq , but if the pilgrim delays it any longer than that, then he must offer a compensatory sacrifice, according to some scholars. (See Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah, 10/12-13)\xa0\nTry to do your Hajj with one of the scholars or seekers of knowledge, so that you can ask him whatever you need to know about Hajj and `Umrah.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/222836/when-to-enter-ihram-for-hajj-tamattu

This is stated clearly elsewhere than in Muslim, and this is permissible according to Ash-Shafa‘i (may Allah have mercy on him) and others.” (Sharh Muslim, 4/181)\nChanging intention of prayer after starting it\nThere is nothing wrong with a person starting his prayer alone and then becoming an Imam when someone else joins him.\xa0\nIbn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I stayed overnight with my maternal aunt. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) got up to pray at night and I got up to pray with him. I stood on his left and he took hold of my head and made me stand on his right.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 667 and Muslim, 763)\xa0\nImam Al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) included this report in a chapter entitled: If the imam did not intend to lead others in prayer, then people join him so he leads them in prayer.\xa0\nAnas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was praying in Ramadan, and I came and stood beside him, and another man came and stood too, until there was a group of us. When the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) realized that I was behind him, he made his prayer brief. (Narrated by Muslim, 1104)\xa0\nSome of the scholars said that it is permissible to do this in optional prayers, but not in obligatory prayers. But the correct view is that it is valid in both cases.\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“The correct view is that that is permissible in both obligatory and optional prayers.” (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 22/258)\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“But the correct view is that it is valid in both obligatory and optional prayers . With regard to optional prayers , it is mentioned in the text; with regard to obligatory prayers, what is proven in the case of optional prayers is also proven with regard to obligatory prayers, unless there is evidence to the contrary.” (Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti`, 2/304)\xa0\nIf you are joined by other people in sunnah prayer, should you recite out loud or quietly?\nIf a person starts to pray behind a man who has started to offer an optional prayer , as in the case asked about here, then the imam has the choice as to whether he recites out loud or quietly . But if he intended to lead the prayer from the outset, then he should recite out loud, because of the Hadith of Mu‘adh (may Allah be pleased with him) quoted above.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/153386/can-you-pray-obligatory-prayer-behind-sunnah-prayer
