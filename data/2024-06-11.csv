270696,I am very emotionally disturbed and need your advice to save this marriage. Iv been married for 3 years and over the years my husband has lied to me on numerous times for which I have forgiven him. He even cheated on me by talking to an ex girl he wanted to marry once and asked for forgiveness when I found out and repented. Then last year I developed a sexual condition when I went to the dr she told me it\'s sexually transmitted disease that only gets passed on from sex. I asked my husband after that if he has ever been in illegitimate relationship that might be the cause and he swore on Allah that he hasn\'t been. I didn\'t get myself properly screened and treated thinking he is telling the truth. Just recently I found out from another source that he was in 8 year relationship with another woman before he married me and commited zina during that time. When I confronted him he threw a fit and said he hid it yes because I do not need to know what has happened in his past..to a degree I agree with that but I also discovered he had been in contact with her after we got married so made an excuse to say that\'s because that woman owed him money she needed to contact etc. If a person really repents do they still have the right to contact them and then keep that hidden from the wife? I feel so broken and shattered. I married this man thinking he is religious and been pious. I haven\'t shared this with anyone in family yet I can\'t stomach it. I feel like I cannot trust this man anymore,"['Praise be to Allah.The conditions of repentance are three: regret for past sin, giving up present sin, and resolving not to go back to that sin in the future. One of the signs of this resolve is closing all doors that lead to that sin and barring all means that could lead to it.\nBased on that: it is not permissible for the one who was communicating with a woman in a way that is prohibited according to Islamic teachings to continue communicating with her under any circumstances. Rather what he must do is close every door that could lead to that. For him, this is the first correct step on the way to repentance, if he is serious about repenting and turning to the Lord of the Worlds.\nOur advice to you, if you want to preserve your marriage, is to be patient with your husband and try to help him to close those doors and try to prevent him from communicating with this woman by all possible means. You can give him another chance to repent and mend his ways, and warn him against not being serious about repentance, messing about with it and breaking his promise to the Lord of the Worlds. You should exhort him and warn him about the evil of these filthy things, the impact they have on a person and the negative consequences to which they will lead in his religious and worldly affairs. The person who sincerely cares about himself should be careful, lest he be disgraced in this world and punished in the hereafter, for Allah may grant respite but He does not forget:\n{So whoever does an atom’s weight of good will see it,\nAnd whoever does an atom’s weight of evil will see it}\xa0[az-Zalzalah 99:7-8].\nIf you can sit with him and have a calm discussion, to try to find out the reasons and motives for his communicating with that woman, we hope that that will be good for both of you.\nUndoubtedly whether he is sincere and serious about committing to that will show on him. If he is serious about that, is sincere in his repentance and is keen to protect his marriage, then stay with him and try to protect your marriage too; strive to forget the past and help him against his own nafs and his shaytan with regard to the future.\nBut if it is otherwise, and he goes back to his old ways, starts to mess around, breaks his promises and carries on in that way, then there is nothing good for you in such a man.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/270696/how-can-i-protect-my-marriage-from-collapse
104197,Is it permissible for a man to cut his own hair when exiting Ihram following `Umrah? Does that also apply to women?,"['Praise be to Allah.It is permissible for the pilgrim, man or woman, who is doing Hajj or `Umrah to cut his or her own hair when exiting Ihram following Hajj or `Umrah , and it is also permissible for him or her to cut the hair of another person who wants to exit Ihram .\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“A pilgrim may shave his own head , or he may ask someone else to do it, which is different from the view of some scholars who said that if he shaves his own head he is doing something that he should not do.

26228,"Should Tawaf be concluded with Takbir at the Black Stone, just as it starts?","['Praise be to Allah.The Standing Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta’ said:\n“Tawaf around the Ka`bah is one of the pure rituals of worship, and the basic principle concerning rituals of worship is that they should be done as prescribed in the Quran and Sunnah.\xa0\nIt was narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to say Takbir in Tawaf every time he came in line with the Black Stone. Undoubtedly the worshipper comes in line with the Black Stone at the end of the seventh circuit, so it is Sunnah for him to say Takbir as it is Sunnah for him to do so at the beginning of each circuit, when he comes in line with it – following the example of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).

237593,"How can I differ from the Jews on the days that they venerate? Is that done by fasting, because fasting means that the day is not a festival (eid)? Or is it by not fasting and not aiming to fast on that day? Regarding the first idea, there is the hadith of Umm Salamah: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to fast on Saturdays and Sundays more than on other days, and he would say: “They are two festival days (eids) of the polytheists, and I like to differ from them.” And regarding the second idea, the scholars give as the reason for that the fact that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade fasting on Saturdays.","['Praise be to Allah.What is known from the teachings of Islam, in which the texts of the Quran and Sunnah were narrated via many chains of narration, is that it is not permissible to imitate the disbelieving nations in what is unique to them of actions, beliefs, words and appearance.\nIt is well known that not imitating them may be achieved by not following them and not doing things that are uniquely theirs.\nThat includes their festivals, so differing from them and not imitating them may be achieved simply by not venerating those festivals and not celebrating them. If the Muslim achieves that and ignores celebrating those days, or avoids singling them out for some activities, then in that case he will have managed to differ from them.\nIt was narrated in the hadith of Anas: When the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came to Madinah, they had two days on which they used to play. He said: “What are these two days?” They said: We used to play on these days during the Jahiliyyah. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has replaced them for you with something better than them: the Day of [Eid] al-Adha and the day of [Eid] al-Fitr.” Narrated by Abu Dawud (1134); classed as sahih by al-Albani in as-Silsilah as-Sahihah (2021).\nThus the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed them to give up celebrating those two days as festivals, but he did not instruct them to do anything more than that, such as fasting and the like, in order to differ from the polytheists.\nAsh-Shatibi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe second type is matters in which the Lawgiver did not give a specific ruling, or overlooked some matters where there is a reason now, and there was a reason at the time of revelation and afterwards, but no instruction was given in addition to what was there at that time.\nWhen the Lawgiver overlooks such matters, it is like stating that the shar‘i objective concerning that matter should not be extended beyond the general rulings concerning such matters, nor should it be reduced, because when there was a reason [at the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)] to dictate a practical, specific ruling, yet the Lawgiver did not legislate such a ruling or indicate that it should be worked out, this makes it clear that anything additional to what was narrated in the religious texts is an innovation (bid‘ah) that has been added and is contrary to the objectives of the Lawgiver, as it may be understood that the Lawgiver intended that we should stop at that limit and not add anything to it or take anything away from it.""(Al-I‘tisam\xa02/282).\nWhat we may understand from the above is that deliberately fasting to confirm that we are different from them is something that is not prescribed, and a number of scholars have stated that it is disliked (makruh) to do so, because paying attention to it and waiting for that day to come every year in order to fast is a kind of venerating it.\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf it is said: What do you say about fasting on the days of Nowruz, Mahrajan and other festivals of the polytheists?\nThe answer is: Many of the scholars regarded that as disliked (makruh) and most of the companions of Ahmad also thought that it is disliked.\nAhmad said, according to a report narrated by his son ‘Abdullah: Waki‘ told us, from Sufyan, from a man, from Anas and al-Hasan, that they disliked fasting on the days of Nowruz and Mahrajan. ‘Abdullah said: My father said: The man [mentioned in the isnad] is Aban ibn Abi ‘Ayyash. When Ahmad gave this answer to the one who asked him about fasting on these two days, this indicates that this was his favoured view. This is one of the two views narrated by his companions regarding such matters.\nAnd it was said that this was not his favoured view, and the view that he narrated is not to be attributed to him. Most of his companions were of the view that it is disliked, and they gave as the reason for that the fact that these are two days that are venerated by the disbelievers, so singling them out from among other days for fasting means going along with the disbelievers in their veneration of these days, so it is disliked [to fast on those two days], as is also the case with regard to Saturday. The author of al-Mughni said: By analogy with this, the same ruling applies to all the festivals of the disbelievers or any day that they single out for veneration.""(Hashiyat Ibn al-Qayyim ma‘a ‘Awn al-Ma‘bud\xa0 7/52).\nSecondly:\nWith regard to the hadith of Kurayb the freed slave of Ibn ‘Abbaas, in which he says that he heard Umm Salamah say: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to fast on Saturdays and Sundays more than on other days, and he would say: “They are two festival days (eids) of the polytheists, and I like to differ from them.” Narrated by Ahmad in al-Musnad (44/330-331); al-Hakim in al-Mustadrak (1/436) – he said: Its isnad is sahih, and adh-Dhahabi did not comment on it.\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Zad al-Ma‘ad (2/74-75): There are some reservations about the soundness of this hadith.\nAl-Albani classed it as da‘if (weak) in Silsilat al-Ahadith ad-Da‘ifah (3/219).\nHence we may note the following:\n1.. There is a difference of scholarly opinion as to the soundness of this hadith. It also contradicts another hadith concerning the soundness of which the scholars differed. It is the hadith which says that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not fast on Saturdays except what is obligatory for you.” Narrated by Abu Dawud (2421), at-Tirmidhi (744) and Ibn Majah (1726).\nBecause of this scholarly difference of opinion, this hadith cannot be taken as a basic principle which applies to every festival of the disbelievers.\n2.. Even if we assume that the hadith is sahih, we cannot apply it to all the festivals of the disbelievers, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) lived alongside the Jews in Madinah and alongside Christians and polytheists in the Arabian Peninsula, and undoubtedly they had a number of festivals and days that they venerated throughout the year, but it is not known that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was keen to fast on the days of their festivals (eids) in order to openly differ from them, apart from Saturdays and Sundays.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAny act of worship that was not prescribed, even though there may have been a reason for it to be done and there was no impediment to that, may be understood as being prohibited.""(Iqtida’ as-Sirat al-Mustaqim\xa0 2/721).\n3.. Some of the scholars thought that in order to reconcile between the texts, it may be noted that regarding the festivals of the disbelievers of which the dates are worked out according to the Arabian calendar, it is recommended (mustahabb) to differ from them by fasting on those days, following the hadith of Umm Salamah. As for festivals of which the dates are worked out according to calendars other than the Arabian calendar, it is not recommended to fast on those days.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIt may be said that it is disliked (makruh) to fast on the days of Nowruz and Mahrajan, and similar days of which the dates are not worked out according to the Arabian calendar, in contrast to what is mentioned in the hadith about Saturdays and Sundays, because if a person aims to fast on the days of non-Arab or jahili festivals, that may lead to doing some rituals on those days and reviving them and making them known, in contrast to Saturdays and Sundays, which are known in the Muslim calendar, and there are no negative consequences to fasting on those days. Thus it is recommended (mustahabb) to fast on the days of their festivals that are known according to the Islamic, Arabian calendar, but it is disliked (makruh) to do so with regard to festivals of which the dates are worked out according to non-Arab, jahili calendars, so that we may reconcile between the hadiths. And Allah knows best.""(Iqtida’ as-Sirat al-Mustaqim\xa0 2/580).\nTherefore, according to this view also, it is still disliked (makruh) to fast on the festivals of the disbelievers, apart from Saturdays and Sundays, because the dates of the festivals of the disbelievers that are well known today are not worked out according to the Islamic calendar.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/237593/how-can-i-differ-from-the-jews-on-the-days-that-they-venerate
