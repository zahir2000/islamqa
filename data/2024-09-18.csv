230874,Is there any hadith from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) which indicates that it is not allowed to eat again shortly after eating?,"['Praise be to Allah.We do not know of any hadith from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) which indicates that it is not allowed to eat again shortly after eating. This is more akin to the words of doctors, and in fact is something that is known from their words.\nBut the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) urged us to eat and drink little, and told us that a person should not eat more than he needs. He (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The son of Adam does not fill any vessel worse than his stomach. It is sufficient for the son of Adam to eat a few mouthfuls, to keep him going. If he must do that (fill his stomach), then let him fill one third with food and one third with drink, and leave one third for breathing.” Narrated and classed as sahih by al-Tirmidhi (2380); also classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih at-Tirmidhi.\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) told us that a few mouthfuls are sufficient to keep him going, and that does not undermine his strength or weaken him. If he does eat more than that, then let him eat what is will fill one third of his stomach, and leave the second third for water and the last third for breathing. This is what is most beneficial for the body and the heart. For if the stomach is filled with food, it leaves little room for drink, and if he follows the food with drink, it will leave little room for breathing, and will cause him to become exhausted and tired from carrying it, like one who carries a heavy load. This is in addition to what that causes of corruption to the heart (in a spiritual sense), making one find it physically difficult to do acts of worship, and provoking desires which must be fulfilled. So filling the stomach with food is harmful both spiritually and physically.\nEnd quote from Zad al-Ma‘ad (4/17).\nAs-Safarini (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Ghidha’ al-Albab (2/110):\nThe one who eats must allocate one third [of his stomach] for food, one third for drink and one third for air, in compliance with the instructions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), who was compassionate and sincere to all people, and that guided us to what is beneficial in both religious and worldly terms… al-Harith ibn Kaladah, the physician of the Arabs, said: “Healthy eating is the best medicine and corpulence is the main cause of illness.” Al-Harith also said: “What kills people and dooms predators is eating again shortly after eating before having digested properly.”\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/230874/is-there-anything-in-the-sunnah-to-indicate-that-it-is-not-allowed-to-eat-again-shortly-after-eating

If We pardon some of you, We will punish others amongst you because they were Mujrimun (disbelievers, polytheists, sinners, criminals, etc.)} [At-Tawbah 9:65-66]\nThe obligation to denounce mockery of Islam\nWhat the one who is present in such a gathering must do is denounce that. If he cannot do that, then he must leave the gathering, so that he will not be a partner in the sin. If he expresses any kind of approval of their actions and words, then he is like them. Allah, may He be Exalted, Says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And when you (Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) see those who engage in a false conversation about Our Verses (of the Quran) by mocking at them, stay away from them till they turn to another topic. And if the devil causes you to forget, then after the remembrance sit not you in the company of those people who are the Dhalimun (polytheists and wrongdoers, etc.)} [Al-An`am 6:68]\n{And it has already been revealed to you in the Book (this Quran) that when you hear the Verses of Allah being denied and mocked at, then sit not with them, until they engage in a talk other than that; (but if you stayed with them) certainly in that case you would be like them. Surely, Allah will collect the hypocrites and disbelievers all together in Hell.} [An-Nisa’ 4:140]\xa0\nAllah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, regards the one who sits in a gathering and witnesses evil, if he does not denounce it, as being like the one who does or speaks that evil.\xa0\nHence it is said that the one who listens is the partner of the one who backbites. According to a report, the one who witnesses sin but hates it is like the one who was absent from it, and the one who was absent from it but approves of it is like the one who witnessed it.\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhen some of them made fun of (the believers) and said concerning those with whom Allah is pleased, “We have never seen anyone like our people who are well-versed in the Quran when it comes to eating more or telling more lies or being more cowardly when meeting the enemy,” Allah revealed the words (interpretation of the meaning):\n{The hypocrites fear lest a Surah (chapter of the Quran) should be revealed about them, showing them what is in their hearts. Say: ""(Go ahead and) mock! But certainly Allah will bring to light all that you fear.’\nIf you ask them (about this), they declare: ‘We were only talking idly and joking.’ Say: `Was it at Allah, and His Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) and His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that you were mocking?\nMake no excuse; you have disbelieved after you had believed. If We pardon some of you, We will punish others amongst you because they were Mujrimun (disbelievers, polytheists, sinners, criminals, etc.)} [Al-Tawbah 9:66]\nAllah informed them that they had disbelieved after having believed, even though they said, “We say words of disbelief without believing in them; rather we were just talking idly and joking.” He explained that mocking the revelations of Allah constitutes disbelief, and such words cannot be uttered except by someone who is content with such words, for if he had faith in his heart, it would have prevented him from saying such words. (End quote from Al-Iman, 2/284)\xa0\nThe dangers of making fun of Islamic Teachings\xa0\nUndoubtedly making fun of any aspect of Islam is contrary to respect and veneration for this religion, especially with regard to matters such as the punishment on the Day of Resurrection, or in the grave, or the terrors of the resurrection. Islam has only told us of these things so as to alarm people and set their hearts straight, so that they will not persist in heedlessness. One of the greatest forms of heedlessness, which is indicative of being overwhelmed by ignorance, whims and desires, and lack of insight, is when one regards matters of exhortation and admonition as a joke and something to be laughed at and made fun of.\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said concerning these hypocrites who make fun of Islam:\xa0\nThis indicates that they did not themselves think that they had committed an act of disbelief; rather they thought that that did not constitute disbelief. So Allah explained that ridiculing Allah and His revelations and His Messenger constituted disbelief and meant that the person had disbelieved after having believed. This indicates that they had faith, albeit weak, and they did this prohibited action knowing that it was prohibited, but they did not think that it constituted disbelief. However it was kufr by means of which they became disbelievers, although they did not think that it was permissible. (End quote from Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 7/273)\xa0\nThe one who falls into such error must renew his faith by uttering the Shahadatayn (two declarations of faith) and repent sincerely from what he has done. As for the Shahadatayn, uttering it in the prayer or in the rituals of `Umrah is sufficient.\xa0\nIt says in Kashshaf Al-Qina` (6/181):\xa0\nIf the disbeliever prays or gives the Adhan (call to prayer), he is deemed to be a Muslim, regardless of whether he was originally a disbeliever or had apostatised. End quote.\xa0\nHow to Repent from Making Fun of Islam\xa0\nWith regard to repentance, it is essential to repent sincerely and specifically from that great evil of making fun of Islam.\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Whoever speaks a word of disbelief, even in jest, has disbelieved. He must repent and must believe that he is repenting from apostasy. So he must renew his Islam, for the revelations of Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, and His Messenger, are too great to be mocked or ridiculed. (End quote from Liqa’at Al-Bab Al-Maftuh, 60/12)\xa0\nWhat you have mentioned about your friends is no excuse for you not to alert them to the serious sin that they have committed; rather what you must do is tell them about the ruling on what they have done, so that they may repent to Allah, may He be Exalted, from it, and they may regret it and be careful not to go back to it again.\xa0\nYou can read this message to them, as an answer to your question, and similar answers having to do with the Islamic ruling on that.\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 102871 , 275500 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/221739/how-to-repent-from-making-fun-of-islam
491457,"I have a friend whose mother likes me and she feels that her son is no longer good, and she asks me about him, and I tell her the truth about what he does. But I have another friend who said that I am causing trouble, and that what I am doing is wrong. I would like to ask you to give a ruling on what I am doing: am I causing trouble or not?","['Praise be to Allah.Islam urges the Muslim to look for righteous friends who will help him to carry out his religious duties and remain steadfast in that, because this is one of the means that help a person to follow the path of righteousness and remain steadfast in adhering to the truth. Having righteous friends is one of the greatest means that helps the Muslim to remain steadfast in his faith. It was narrated from Abu Musa that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The believers (in their mutual support) are like a structure, parts of which support other parts” – and he interlaced his fingers. Narrated by al-Bukhari (467).\nMusa (peace be upon him) sought righteous company, even though he was a prophet:\n{And appoint for me a helper from my family,\nHarun, my brother.\nStrengthen me through him,\nand let him share in my task,\nso that we may glorify You much\nand remember You much}\xa0[Ta-Ha 20:29-34].\nAccording to the hadith narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “A man will follow the way of his close friend, so let one of you look at who he takes as a close friend.” Narrated by Abu Dawud (4833); classed as sahih by al-Albani.\nOne of the factors that facilitate sincerity in friendship, love and companionship is when each person is very keen to make sure that his friend is in the best state in terms of religious commitment and manners. This is why it is prescribed to choose righteous and sincere friends and companions. This is a crucial element of true brotherhood and is one of the foundations thereof.\nIt was narrated that Jarir ibn ‘Abdillah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I swore allegiance to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) pledging to establish prayer, give zakah and show sincerity to every Muslim. Narrated by al-Bukhari (57).\nSo if a person sees his brother or friend misbehaving, he must advise him and correct him, and keep him away from the places and means that may make him fall into that bad conduct.\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is important to get together with one’s brothers in order to cooperate in attaining means of salvation, exhort one another to hold fast to the truth and exhort one another to hold fast to patience. That is one of the greatest means of attaining success. Al-Fawa’id (1/71).\nBased on that, it is your duty towards your friend to create a good environment that will enable you both to carry out your religious duties, help you both to avoid sin and protect you both from drifting away.\nSo if you see your friend making a mistake or doing something wrong, then the first step – as we have mentioned above – is to advise him, correct him, help him to do good, divert him from what is wrong and evil, warn him against it, and warn him of the bad consequences of his misbehaviour and the danger of having bad friends.\nSecondly:\nIf he does not respond to advice, then there are two scenarios regarding the way to deal with the situation:\n-1-\nIf his mistakes are rare slips, there is no need to tell his family, so as to maintain the good relationship between you, and because the basic principle is to conceal the mistakes of one’s fellow Muslim. Your important role is to continue to be a friend who tries to help him to do good, and strives to correct his friend’s behaviour and advise him. This is the benefit of being a good brother and a good friend.\n-2-\nIf these mistakes become habitual and you are not able to turn him away from this misbehaviour, then in that case you should tell his family about it, so that it does not become ingrained behaviour or lead to persistent decline and drifting away from the straight path.\nThat is because covering up for him in this case would lead to the problem becoming worse and his persisting in wrongdoing without anyone intervening to stop him and correct him. This comes under the heading of enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong, by means of which social conduct may be corrected.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/491457/should-he-tell-his-friends-family-about-his-misdeeds

I introduce d matter. Manqooz moulid has been widely spread book in kerala which every one read at their home for fulfilling their need.

is there any Shirk in above line..? Reading it should be haram..?
Pls help me to protect our deen..? U will get great reward from allah if u make me clear about this so that i cn tell it to everyone.. There may be so many grammer mistake. So U can change this question to understandable form..","['Praise be to Allah.Review of the book `Manqoos Moulid’\nThe book referred to is a book of myths, fables, Shirk and innovation. The author wrote it to give evidence, falsely, that it is Islamically prescribed to celebrate the Prophet’s birthday and to exaggerate about the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and to seek his help and ask of him – and other Prophets and righteous people – besides Allah. Hence it is full of falsehoods, fabricated Hadiths and strange stories. If we were to examine it and critique it, it would take a very long time. Almost every single line of it requires some comment and refutation.\xa0\nAmong these lies and fabrications is what he (falsely) attributes to Imam Abu Hanifah (may Allah have mercy on him), saying that he used to seek the help of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and ask him besides Allah, saying:\n“O Master of masters, I have come to you, hoping that you will be pleased with me and will offer me your protection.\nBy Allah, O Best of creation, I have a heart that is longing for you and does not want anyone but you.\nBy your virtue, I am in love with you, and Allah knows how much I love you.\nO you who are the best of the two races (mankind and the jinn), bestow on me your generosity; I am happy if you are pleased with me.\nI am hoping for your generosity, as Abu Hanifah has no one else in this world but you.”\xa0\nThen he says that Imam Ash-Shafi`i (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“The family of the Prophet are my means to reach Him and they would lead me to Him.\nI hope by virtue of them that I will be given my record in my right hand on the Day of Resurrection.”\xa0\nThis is undoubtedly a lie about these two great imams who affirmed the Oneness of Allah. Otherwise, let him prove that from them with sound chains of narration going back to them, or even a weak chain of narration via which such a report could be transmitted. But they can never do that!\xa0\nThe polytheistic material narrated in this book includes the following:\xa0\n“It should be noted that seeking help from the beloved ones of Allah, may He be Exalted, such as the Prophets, the Awliya’ (close friends of Allah) and the righteous is permissible during their lifetimes and after their deaths…\xa0\n“… Thus it is known that it is permissible to seek help by saying `O Messenger of Allah, help me’ or `O Ghawth (source of help), O Muhiy Ad-Din `Abd Al-Qadir Al-Jilani and so on.”\xa0\nAnother example of this polytheistic material that is contained in this book is that which is mentioned by the questioner, “artakabtu Al-khataya, laka ashku ya sidi ya khayr an-nabiyyin (I have committed sins, I complain to you, O my master, O best of the Prophets).”\nThis comes under the heading of major polytheism, because repentance from sins can only be to Allah alone, and complaining about the consequences of sins and their impact can only be done to Allah alone.\xa0\nIn the answer to question no. 179363, we explained that the words (interpretation of the meaning): {If they (hypocrites), when they had been unjust to themselves, had come to you (Muhammad blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)…} [An-Nisa’ 4:64] were applicable only during the lifetime of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and not after his death.\xa0\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“This verse encouraged the Ummah to come to him if they had been unjust to themselves (or wronged themselves) by committing sin or falling into that which was more serious than that, namely Shirk. They were to come to him, repentant and regretting what they had done, so that he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) could pray for forgiveness for them. What was meant by that coming was coming to him (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) when he was still alive. Coming to him after his death for this purpose is not permissible. The evidence for that is the fact that the Companions and those who had deep knowledge of Islam did not do that, and because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not have the power to do that after he died.” (End quote from Majmu` Fatawa Ibn Baz, 6/189-190)\xa0\nCan you ask the Prophet for help?\nCalling upon the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and asking of him besides Allah, and seeking his help, is a major Shirk that puts one beyond the pale of Islam, so how about seeking the help of anyone other than him?\xa0\nThe scholars of the Standing Committee said:\xa0\n“Calling upon the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and seeking his help after his death to meet one’s needs or relieve one of distress is major Shirk that puts one beyond the pale of Islam.” (End quote from Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 1/473)\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Calling upon the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) or any lesser person is Shirk and misguidance, because these people cannot respond. What one must do is repent to Allah from this Shirk and not call upon anyone except Allah. We all know that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) himself did not possess any power to bring benefit or cause harm, except by the will of Allah. Allah, may He be Exalted, instructed him to declare that to his Ummah, as Allah said to him (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Say (O Muhammad blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): `I possess no power of benefit or hurt to myself except as Allah wills. If I had the knowledge of the Ghaib (unseen), I should have secured for myself an abundance of wealth, and no evil should have touched me. I am but a warner, and a bringer of glad tidings unto people who believe.} [Al-A`raf 7:188]\n{Say (O Muhammad blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): `I don’t tell you that with me are the treasures of Allah, nor (that) I know the unseen; nor I tell you that I am an angel. I but follow what is revealed to me by inspiration’.} [Al-An`am 6:50]\nThe Messenger himself used to pray to Allah , may He be Glorified, seeking forgiveness and mercy for himself, and for his companions. If he had been able to grant forgiveness to anyone or bestow mercy on him, he would not have needed to pray to Allah, may He be Glorified, for that. But all of creation is in need of Allah, and it is Allah alone Who is Free of all wants and needs, Worthy of all praise, as He, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {O mankind! it is you who stand in need of Allah, but Allah is Rich (Free of all wants and needs), Worthy of all praise} [Fatir 35:15]. Were it not for the devils toying with the minds of these people they would realise that the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and others do not possess any power to benefit or harm anyone, and they would call upon Allah alone, with no partner or associate: {Is not He (better than your gods) Who responds to the distressed one, when he calls Him, and Who removes the evil, and makes you inheritors of the earth, generations after generations. Is there any god with Allah?} [An-Naml 27:62]” (End quote from Majmu` Fatawa wa Rasa’il Al-`Uthaymin, 21/218-219)\xa0\nThe point is that complaining about one’s situation and one’s sin, admitting it and repenting from it to any human being, or seeking help and aid from him, comes under the heading of Shirk or ascribing partners to Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted. Indeed it comes under the heading of pure acts of worship which it is not permissible to devote to any except Allah, may He be Exalted.\xa0\nIn Sahih Muslim (2577) it is narrated that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said, narrating from his Lord, may He be blessed and Exalted: “ `O My slaves, all of you are astray except those whom I guide, so ask Me for guidance, and I will guide you. O My slaves, all of you are hungry except those whom I feed, so ask me for food and I will feed you. O My slaves, all of you are naked except those whom I clothe, so ask Me for clothing and I will clothe you. O My slaves, you err night and day, but I forgive all sins, so ask Me for forgiveness and I will forgive you.’”\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“With regard to that which no one but Allah, may He be Exalted, is able to do, it is not permissible to seek it from anyone except Allah, may He be Glorified; it should not be sought from the angels or from the Prophets or from anyone else. It is not permissible to say to anyone other than Allah: `Forgive me’ or `Grant us rain or `Grant us victory over the disbelieving people’ or `Guide our hearts’ and so on. Hence At-Tabarani narrated in his Majma` that at the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) there was a hypocrite who used to annoy the believers, so they said: Let us go and seek the help of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) against this hypocrite. So they came to him and he said: “Help should not be sought from me; rather it should be sought from Allah.” (End quote from Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 1/329)\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/200862/can-you-ask-the-prophet-for-help
