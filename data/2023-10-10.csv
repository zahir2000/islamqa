308325,"Just want to know if the germ-line gene therapy, which is the introduction of new DNA into gamete cells (sperm or egg) or embryo to prevent or treat genetic disorders permissible or not. Also while this is mostly at research level and a lot of research suggests that it can cause harm as well but it can also work towards treating disease. Considering both these scenarios of harm and cure is it permissible to research into it?","['Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with using gene therapy to prevent or treat genetic disorders if it is free of harm or if any harm is minor and may be overlooked in comparison to the interest that is served and the expected benefits.\nThere is nothing wrong with researching and studying that, and striving to develop it in order to get rid of harmful side effects.\nIn a symposium of the Islamic Organisation for Medical Sciences in Kuwait, on the topic of “Heredity, Genetic Engineering, the Human Genome and Gene Therapy: an Islamic Perspective,” held in partnership with the Islamic Fiqh Council in Jeddah, the regional office of the World Health Organisation in Alexandria, and the Islamic World Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (ISESCO), 23-25 Jumada al-Akhirah 1419 AH/13-15 October 1998 CE, in which a number of senior jurists, doctors, pharmacists, specialists in biological sciences and scholars in other human sciences, the recommendations made by the symposium included the following:\nThirdly: genetic engineering:\nThe symposium studied the topic of genetic engineering and the fears and concerns that have surrounded it since its inception in the 1970s, if it is implemented without guidelines, because it is a two-edged sword that may be used for good or ill.\nThe symposium determined that it is permissible to use it to prevent, treat or alleviate disease, whether it is gene surgery which replaces one gene with another, or inserts the gene into the patient’s cells, or inserts a gene into another living being so as to obtain a large quantity of the secretions of that gene for use as treatment for some diseases.\nAt the same time, the use of genetic engineering on reproductive cells should be prevented, because of the shar‘i reservations concerning that.\nThe symposium affirms the necessity of governments providing such services to those of their citizens who need them but have limited income, because of the high costs involved in producing them.\nThe symposium thinks that it is not permissible to use genetic engineering for evil purposes or to cross the genetic border between different species with the aim of creating hybrid beings for the purpose of entertainment or scientific curiosity.\nThe symposium also thinks that it is not permissible to use genetic engineering as a routine practice for the purpose of changing the genetic structure, in what is known as eugenics (aiming to improve the genetic quality of a human population). Any attempt to tamper with genes in order to change a person’s character or interfere with his fitness to be responsible for his actions is prohibited according to Islamic teachings.\nThe symposium does not see anything wrong, from an Islamic perspective, with using genetic engineering in the fields of agriculture and animal husbandry.\nBut the symposium does not ignore the voices which have recently warned against the possibility of long-term harm that could affect humans, animals, crops or the environment.\nThe symposium thinks that companies and factories which produce food products of animal or plant origin should disclose to the public which of their products are prepared using genetic engineering, so that people will know what they are buying. The symposium also recommends complete awareness in monitoring the results of consuming such products and following the advice and statements of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) regarding this matter.""(Majallat Majma‘ al-Fiqh al-Islami, issue no. 11, Vol. 3, p. 533).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/308325/ruling-on-using-gene-therapy-to-prevent-or-treat-genetic-disorders
2148,"What is the ruling on giving medication in Islam, especially in cases of diseases where there is no hope of a cure? Is it necessary to obtain the patient’s permission before giving treatment, particularly in emergency situations?","['Praise be to Allah.Is it permissible to seek medication?\nThe governing principle is that it is allowed to seek medication because of what has been narrated to this effect in the Quran and Sunnah, i.e., the words and deeds of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and because it involves saving lives, which is one of the overall aims of Shari`ah.\nThe rulings governing the issue of seeking medication differ according to the circumstances and people involved:\n\nSeeking medication is obligatory in cases where not giving medication could cause death, disability or the loss of a limb, or where the sickness is bound to spread if not treated, as in contagious diseases.\nIt is encouraged in cases where not giving medication may weaken a person physically, and it is not as bad as the cases mentioned above.\nIt is allowed in cases which are not covered in the two preceding categories.\nIt is discouraged in cases where the treatment could lead to complications that are worse than the original complaint.\n\nTreatment of cases where recovery is hopeless\xa0\n\nThe Muslim believes that disease and cure are matters that are under the control of Allah, may He be glorified. Treatment and medication are ways of utilizing the laws of cause and effect that Allah has incorporated into the running of the universe.\xa0 It is not permitted to despair of the mercy of Allah – there should always be the hope of healing by the permission of Allah.\xa0 The doctors and families should try to raise the morale of those who are sick and continue their efforts to relieve the mental and physical suffering of the patient regardless of whether a cure is expected or not.\nDeeming a situation to be hopeless is based only on doctors’ opinions, the state of medical science in any given time or place, and the circumstances of the patient himself.\n\nShould we seek the patient’s permission to give him medication?\n\nSeeking the patient’s permission depends on whether he is qualified to give it (i.e., he should be of sound mind, mature, and responsible). If this is not the case, then the permission of his guardian should be sought, within the limits set by Shari`ah which requires the guardian to take care of a person’s interests and protect him from harm. No attention should be paid to the guardian’s refusal to give permission if this is obviously going to harm the person. In this case, guardianship has to be transferred to another guardian, or to the Muslim leader.\nThe Muslim leader has the right to force medication in certain situations, such as a case of contagious disease, or the giving of vaccines or when taking preventive measures to control the spread of diseases.\nIn an emergency where lives are at stake, treatment can be administered without waiting for permission or consent.\nWhen carrying out medical research, there must be total agreement on the part of suitably qualified subjects, with no element of compulsion (such as using prisoners for research) or financial compulsion (such as using the poor), and no harm must result from this research.\xa0 It is not permitted to carry out medical research on people who are unable to give their consent, even if their guardians agree to it.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2148/is-it-permissible-to-seek-medication
112124,"I have got engaged to a young man who I think is good. Do you advise me to buy a wedding dress that is a little expensive, or should I try to save the cost of this dress so that this will not be regarded as extravagant? Please note that he is well off and can afford to buy the dress.","['Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with buying a dress for the woman to wear for her wedding, even if it is expensive, so long as it does not reach the level of being extravagant. This varies from one environment and one person to another, but if this dress is only going to be worn once or a few times, as is the case with many women, then it is better not to buy it and to do without it by renting or borrowing a dress, and saving the money that would be paid for it. That is better and more useful.\nIf the woman wants to buy this dress, then she should choose something that she can wear for her wedding and on other occasions, so as to save money, hers and her husband’s. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade wasting money, and Allah, may He be exalted, condemns spendthrifts and states that they are the brothers of the devils.\nThere are some righteous women who are very well off; one of them may buy a dress for her own wedding, then make it a waqf for the benefit of her sisters, so that they can wear it for their weddings. This is a good idea.\nFor more information, please see the answer to question number 12853 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/112124/buying-an-expensive-wedding-dress
21878,"I know that it is only permissible for a Muslim to be mad at a fellow brother for 3 days at most, and the one who is better is he who talks first. However, if I only see a certain brother once a week or so, is it permissible for me to turn away 3 times that I see him، or do I have to stick with the 3 day limit. If I do,  then he will never know my displeasure with him. I know this isn't a good attitude to have, but sometimes a brother may do something and I would like to let him know that I do not approve of it.","['Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to forsake a Muslim, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “It is not permissible for a man to forsake his Muslim brother for more than three days, each of them turning away from the other when they meet. The better of them is the one who gives the greeting of Salam first.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 5727; Muslim, 2560)\nIf the believer is a relative, such as a brother, nephew, uncle or cousin, then forsaking is an even worse sin.\xa0\nThis applies unless the person is committing a sin and there is an interest to be served by forsaking him, i.e., it will make him give up the sin. In that case, there is nothing wrong with it because this comes under the heading of removing evil. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever among you sees an evil action, let him change it with his hand [by taking action]; if he cannot, then with his tongue [by speaking out]; if he cannot then with his heart [by hating it and feeling that it is wrong], and that is the weakest level of faith.”\xa0(Narrated by Muslim, 49) \xa0\nThe basic principle is that it is prohibited for a Muslim to forsake his fellow-Muslim unless there is a reason to allow it.\xa0(See Fatawa Manar Al-Islam, by Ibn ‘Uthaymin, vol. 3, p. 732)\xa0\nWali Al-Din Al-‘Iraqi said:\xa0\n“This prohibition applies in cases where the forsaking is caused by anger with regard to something permissible and has nothing to do with religion. With regard to forsaking someone for a religious reason, such as his committing sin or Bid`ah; this is not prohibited. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded (his companions) to forsake Ka`b ibn Malik, Hilal ibn Umayyah and Mararah ibn Al-Rabi’ (may Allah be pleased with them). Ibn ‘Abd Al-Barr said: This Hadith of Ka`b indicates that it is permissible for a man to forsake his Muslim brother if he commits some act of Bid’ah or immorality, in the hope that forsaking him may discipline him and serve as a rebuke to him. Abu Al-‘Abbas Al-Qurtubi said: With regard to forsaking a person because of sin or Bid`ah, it should be continued until he repents from that and does not go back to it. Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr also said: The scholars are unanimously agreed that it is impermissible for a Muslim to forsake his fellow-Muslim for more than three days, unless there is the fear that speaking to him and keeping in touch with him will affect one’s religious commitment or have some harmful effect on one\'s spiritual and worldly interests. If that is the case, it is permissible to avoid him, because peaceful avoidance is better than harmful mixing."" (Tarh Al-Tathrib, 8/99)\nWhat you should do, if your brother has done something prohibited, is to advise him and explain that this thing is prohibited, and remind him of Allah. If you see that he is persisting in his sin and you think that forsaking him will serve a purpose, then it is permissible to do so, as stated above. But if he has simply done something that you do not agree with, or it is the matter of different points of view, then you should explain to him that you do not agree with what he has done, or with his mistaken point of view. But if you make forsaking him the sign of your disagreeing with him, this may lead to him rejecting your view completely, let alone the fact that this is not a legitimate Islamic justification for forsaking him for more than three days. We have seen above in the Fatwa of Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin that the basic principle is that it is prohibited for a Muslim to forsake his fellow-Muslim, unless there is a reason to allow it.\xa0\nThe Muslim must be forbearing and sincere towards his brothers, he must be tolerant towards them and overlook their mistakes. He should not hasten to adopt a solution that may cause division and prohibited kinds of forsaking. May Allah help us all to do that which He loves and which pleases Him.\xa0\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 13731 , 11018 , 126918 , 93775 , and 93146 .']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21878/forsaking-your-muslim-brother-because-of-differences-in-opinion
