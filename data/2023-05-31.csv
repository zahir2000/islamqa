194268,"We live in Syria, and the water is cut off constantly, especially in Idlib. We have a public facility in the city, namely the fire station, from which we can bring water, but with great difficulty. My question is: when the water is cut off from the houses and mosques, is it permissible to do tayammum or not? If the answer is yes, what is the evidence of the Shafa‘is on the issue of masafat al-ghawth [the distance within which a call for help will be heard] with regard to looking for water?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe jurists of the four madhhabs are unanimously agreed in stipulating that one should first search for water when it is not available, in order for it to become permissible to do tayammum, unless there is certainty that water is not to be found anywhere. But they differed with regard to the extent of the search and the distance one should go to look for it.\nIt says in al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (14/255-256):\nThe jurists differed regarding the definition of the distance from the water source which makes it permissible to do tayammum:\nThe Hanafis are of the view that it is one mile, which is equivalent to four thousand cubits.\nThe Malikis defined the distance as two miles, and the Shafa‘is defined it as four hundred cubits; this is the hadd al-ghawth [the distance within which a call for help will be heard], which is the distance of an arrow shot. That is the case when the individual thinks that there may be water, or thinks it most likely, or he is not sure whether there is any water. Then if he does not find water, he should do tayammum. The same ruling was stated by the Hanafis, who said that it is obligatory to search for water within a distance of four hundred steps, if the individual thinks that he is close to water and it is safe to search.\nThe Shafa‘is are of the view that if he is certain that there is no water around him, then he may do tayammum without having to look for water. But if he is certain that there is water around him, he must look for it within the limit that is regarded as close (which is a distance of six thousand steps). According to the Shafa‘is, water is not to be sought, whether it is within the distance that is regarded as close or within the distance within which a call for help will be heard, unless he feels that he is safe and there is no risk to his life and property, and there is no risk of his being cut off from his travelling companions.\nThe Malikis said: If he is sure or thinks that there is water, he must look for it within a distance of two miles. According to the Hanbalis, he must seek it within the distance that is customarily regarded as being nearby. End quote.\nTo sum up the view of the Shafa‘is: The traveller [who lacks water] may be in one of four situations:\n1.\xa0He is certain that there is no water available, in which case he may do tayammum without searching for water.\n2.\xa0He thinks that there may be water, or thinks it most likely, or he is not sure whether there is any water. In this case, he should search in the area where he is halting and with his travelling companions, within the distance within which a call for help will be heard, which in their view is four hundred cubits. Then if he does not find any water, he may do tayammum, because water is not available.\nThe distance within which a call for help will be heard means that he should search for water within the distance within which he will be heard if he calls for help, meaning where his cry will be heard by his companions, even if they are distracted by their own work and their talk. This distance varies depending on how flat or otherwise the land is.\n3.\xa0He knows that there is water available in a place that a traveller who is travelling for a purpose, such as collecting firewood or grass, could reach. This distance is greater than the distance within which a call for help will be heard mentioned above, and is described as water being available nearby; according to the Shafa‘is, it is six thousand cubits. He must seek water from there, if there is no risk of his being cut off from his travelling companions or of the time for the prayer ending. If there is any risk of that, then he is not obliged to seek water.\n4.\xa0The water is further away than that nearby place, which is described as water being available far away; in this case, he may do tayammum and he is not obliged to look for water, because it is too far away. But if he is certain that water will become available towards the end of the time for the prayer, then waiting for it is better than hastening to pray with tayammum. If he is certain that there is no water, or there is doubt as to whether water will come, or he is not sure whether it will come at the end of the time for the prayer, then hastening to pray with tayammum is better in that case.\nSee: Rawdat at-Talibin (1/93); Hashiyat al-Bujayrimi (2/453-454); Asna al-Matalib (1/73); al-Muqaddimah al-Hadramiyyah (p. 46).\nThese limits mentioned above are based on ijtihad and vary between jurists. They are based on trying to ascertain that water is not available when one thinks that it may be available, within the distance within which the accountable person is able to search for water within the time available before the time for prayer ends.\nThe basic principle regarding the command enjoining the one who is accountable to start looking for water is the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{… and [if you] find no water, then seek clean earth and wipe over your faces and your hands [with it]}\xa0[an-Nisa’ 4:43].\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nMany jurists understood from this verse that it is not permissible for one who lacks water to do tayammum until after having looked for water. If he looks for it and does not find it, then in that case it becomes permissible for him to do tayammum. They have explained how to look for it in books that discuss minor issues of jurisprudence.""(Tafsir Ibn Kathir\xa0 2/318).\nSecondly:\nIf the water is cut off and not available, and there is too much hardship involved in searching for it:\nThen either this hardship is obvious and is unbearable when one has to do religious obligations that are repeated throughout the day, in which case the accountable person may avail himself of the concession granted in Islamic teachings that is appropriate to his situation,\nor this hardship is mild and bearable in such circumstances, in which case he must put up with it and seek water, and it is not permissible for him to do tayammum.\nAl-Hafiz as-Suyuti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nHardship may be divided into two categories:\n1.\xa0Inevitable hardship that one would normally face when wanting to do some acts of worship, such as the hardship of cold when doing wudu’ and ghusl, or the hardship of fasting in intense heat during long days, the hardship of travelling for Hajj and jihad that cannot be avoided, and the hardship of the pain involved in hadd punishments, stoning adulterers and executing criminals. This has no impact on waiving acts of worship at any time.\n2.\xa0As for the hardship that one would not face under normal circumstances when doing acts of worship, it is of different levels:\nThe first level is extreme and grievous hardship, such as fearing for one’s life, limbs and faculties. This definitely makes it a must to avail oneself of concessions, because preserving life and limb so that one may continue to carry out religious duties is more appropriate than exposing them to harm and damage in the course of doing an act or acts of worship that could lead to such harm and damage.\nThe second level is mild hardship that has no impact, such as mild pain in a finger, a mild headache, or a mild bad mood. This has no impact and no attention is to be paid to it, because doing acts of worship and carrying out religious obligations is more important than warding off such minor hardship.\nThe third level is that which comes in between these two levels. Whatever is closer to being severe, then the concession should be granted; whatever is closer to being mild, no concession is granted, as in the case of a low-grade fever or mild toothache.\nWhen it is not clear which category it is closer to, there are different views.\nThese levels cannot be worked out on the basis of accuracy; what is mentioned is only approximate.\nShaykh ‘Izz ad-Din pointed out that the most appropriate way to categorise levels of hardship in doing acts of worship is to have guidelines on how difficult each act of worship is, by comparing it with the least hardship that is regarded as being hard enough to allow the concession with regard to that act of worship. If it is like that or greater, then the concession may be granted.""(Al-Ashbah wa’n-Naza’ir\xa0p. 80-81).\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf one who tills the earth fears that if he seeks water his property may be stolen or it could undermine the work that he needs to do, he may pray with tayammum. If he is able to put together two prayers with one wudu’, that is better than offering each prayer separately. The same applies to other excuses that make doing tayammum permissible: if it is possible to put prayers together after purifying oneself with water, that is better than offering them separately after purifying oneself by doing tayammum.""(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa\xa0 21/457).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said:\nHe must look for water if it is within a distance that is regarded as close, so he must search to see whether there is a well or stream near him or around him. There is no clear definition for what is regarded as near or close, so he should refer to custom regarding that, and custom varies from one time to another. In our own time, we have cars, so what was previously regarded as far is now near. In the past, what they had was camels, so what is now regarded as near was regarded as far.\nSo he should look within a distance that is near enough that it will not become too hard for him to look for water or cause him to miss the time for the prayer.\nOr he may ask someone where water is, meaning that he can seek water by asking someone to show him where it is.\nIf he has no water with him, and he cannot search for it because he has no knowledge of the area, or because if he goes away from where he is he will become lost, then what he must do is ask someone else to tell him where water is, whether that is in return for money or for free.\nIf he has no water with him, and there is no water nearby and no one to ask to show him where water is, then it is prescribed for him to do tayammum.""(Ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘\xa0 1/386).\nThe scholars of the Permanent Committee were asked:\nWhen I am grazing my flocks, I take water with me to meet my need only. Is it permissible for me to do tayammum even though the village is a kilometre or more away from me?\nThey replied: It is not permissible for you to do tayammum for prayer in this situation, because the distance to the place where there is water is close enough, and there is not usually any difficulty in going there, and the time for the prayer is not going to end if you go and seek water in this case.""(Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah\xa04/179).\nBased on the above:\nIf there is no water in the city, and it is cut off from the houses and mosques, and bringing water from the fire station can only be done with great difficulty and hardship, or the amount of water brought to the fire station is not sufficient for household uses and for purification by doing wudu’ and ghusl, then there is nothing wrong with doing tayammum, because Allah, may He be exalted, says at the end of the verse of tayammum (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Allah does not intend to make difficulty for you, but He intends to purify you}\xa0[al-Ma’idah 5:6],\nand because of the general meaning of the verse\n{Allah intends for you ease and does not intend for you hardship}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:185].\nBut if water becomes unavailable or cut off, and bringing it from the fire station may cause hardship that is normal for people in such circumstances, then you must bring water for purifying yourselves, and it is not permissible to do tayammum.\nFor more information, please see the answers to questions no. 26270 and 149922 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/194268/is-it-permissible-to-do-tayammum-if-the-water-is-cut-off-and-it-is-too-difficult-to-bring-it-from-elsewhere
272976,"I read on Islamic websites a number of fatwas which say that if istinja’ water enters the penis then comes out of it, it is regarded as impure (najis) and invalidates wudu’. This is what is making me very anxious, because when I have a bath or clean myself after relieving myself (istinja’), I noticed that some water enters the opening of the penis and remains inside it, then it comes out of it. There is no doubt about that; rather it is something certain, one million per cent. I asked a doctor and he told me that this water does not enter the urethra. This means that the water only enters the opening of the penis, but it does not enter the urethra itself. I have also noticed that there is always some moisture in the opening of the penis, at times other than cleaning myself after relieving myself or taking a bath. After lengthy research and asking a doctor, I came to know that the opening of the penis on the inside has a mucous membrane lining which produces moisture to protect this area, like the moisture inside the mouth. This moisture does not worry me at all, because it does not come out of the opening of the penis. But the problem is the fact that this moisture is present in the urethra, i.e., in the place of impurity (najasah), and when having a bath or cleaning myself after relieving myself, some of the water enters the opening of the penis, and thus comes into contact with this moisture. My question is twofold: Firstly, what is the ruling on the water that enters the opening of the penis when having a bath or cleaning myself after relieving myself – does it become impure (najis) as a result of coming into contact with the moisture that is present inside the opening of the penis, through which urine has passed? Secondly, can we say that the water that enters the opening of the penis then comes out of it does not invalidate wudu’ so long as it does not go all the way back to the urethra itself, and that its entry is limited only to the opening of the penis? In other words, is what matters in invalidating wudu’ the urethra or the opening of the penis?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIf someone causes water, oil or anything else to enter the urethra, then it comes out, it is impure (najis) and invalidates wudu’.\nIbn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If he drops oil into his urethra, then it comes out again, it invalidates wudu’, because it came out of the passage, which cannot be free of some impure wetness that accompanies it. Therefore wudu’ is invalidated thereby, just as when only impurity (najasah) comes out.""(Al-Mughni\xa0 1/125).\nThis applies if the water reaches the inside, in the sense that when it comes out it is regarded as coming out from the passage. But if it only reaches the opening of the penis, which is regarded as pure (tahir), and it does not go any deeper, then it has no impact.\nWhat you have mentioned is no more than intrusive thoughts (waswasah), because it is difficult for water to enter inside the penis, unless the individual deliberately makes an effort to do that.\nIf we assume that that happened, then what you must do is relieve yourself after doing ghusl, and clean yourself (istinja’) by washing the tip of the penis without opening it or examining it, and you should not do anything other than that, otherwise you will be opening the door to intrusive thoughts.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Majmu‘ al-Fatawa (21/106): Examining the penis and squeezing out the last drop of urine, and the like, is all an innovation (bid‘ah) that is not required or recommended according to the leading scholars of the Muslims. moreover, by the same token, shaking the penis is also an innovation according to the correct view, and it was not prescribed by the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nSimilarly, expressing the urine is an innovation that was not prescribed by the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). The hadith which speaks of that is da‘if (weak) and has no basis. The urine comes out naturally, and when one has finished it stops naturally. As it was said, it is like the udder, if you leave it alone it will dry up, but if you squeeze it, milk will flow.\nEvery time the individual opens the opening of his penis, something may come out, but if he leaves it alone nothing will come out. He may imagine that something has come out, but this is intrusive thoughts.\nThe one who experiences that may feel some coolness at the tip of the penis and think that something has come out of it, when nothing has come out.\nUrine may be retained at the top of the urethra and not drip, but if he squeezes the penis or the opening with a rock, finger or anything else, some moisture will come out. This is also an innovation, and that retained urine that does not need to be forced out, according to scholarly consensus, either with a rock or a finger or anything else. Rather every time he forces it out, more will come, for it is dripping all the time. Cleaning oneself with stones is sufficient and there is no need to wash the penis with water. It is recommended for the one who does use water to sprinkle water on his private part, then if he feels any moisture, he can say: it is from that water. End quote.\nSecondly:\nWater that remains on the penis after purifying it is deemed to be pure, because water that is separate from the impurity after cleaning it is pure (tahir).\nThirdly:\nAfter you clean yourself (istinja’) you should sprinkle some water on your underwear, so that if you notice any moisture after that, you can tell yourself that it is the water that you sprinkled in your underwear.\nIbn Majah (464) narrated that Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did wudu’ then sprinkled water on his private part. Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is recommended to sprinkle water on the private parts and trousers, in order to dispel intrusive thoughts.\nHanbal said: I asked Ahmad: I do wudu’ after I cleanse myself, and I feel that I have invalidated my wudu’. He said: If you want to do wudu’, then in order to put your mind at rest, take a handful of water and sprinkle it over your private part, and do not pay attention to it [the intrusive thought], then it will go away, in sha Allah.""(Al-Mughni\xa01/115).\nIt says in al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (4/125): The Hanafis, Shafa‘is and Hanbalis stated that when a person has finished cleaning himself with water (istinja’) it is recommended for him to sprinkle his private part or his trousers with some water, so as to ward off intrusive thoughts, so that if he develops any doubts he will interpret that wetness as being from the sprinkling of that water, unless he is certain otherwise. End quote.\nWhat appears to us to be the case from your questions is that you are affected by intrusive thoughts (waswas); may Allah Most Generous heal you of it by His grace. So distract yourself from these intrusive thoughts as much as you can, and seek refuge with Allah from them. We advise you to consult a specialist doctor, for these intrusive thoughts are a sickness, like any other sickness. So if you combine medicinal treatment with the spiritual treatment of seeking refuge with Allah and ruqyah, and behavioural therapy with a therapist who understands that, that will be good for you, and I hope that you will recover from it, in sha Allah.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/272976/istinja-water-entering-the-urethra-then-coming-out-again
