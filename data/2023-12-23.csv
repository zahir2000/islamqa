429057,How can it be that the Hour will come upon the worst of people when the Trumpet blast will come when all people will be dead?,"['Praise be to Allah.It is narrated that the Hour will only come upon the worst of people.\nImam Muslim (148) narrated from Anas that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The Hour will not begin until it is no longer said on earth, ‘Allah, Allah.’”\nAnd the souls of the believers will be taken when the Hour is approaching.\nImam Muslim (2940) narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The Dajjal will appear among my ummah and he will stay for forty. I do not know if it is forty days, or forty months, or forty years. Then Allah will send ‘Isa ibn Maryam, who looks like ‘Urwah ibn Mas‘ud, and he will pursue him [the Dajjal] and kill him. Then the people will remain for seven years with no enmity between any two people. Then Allah will send a cool wind from the direction of Syria and there will be no one left on the face of the earth in whose heart there is an atom’s weight of goodness or faith but it will cause him to die. Even if one of you were to enter the heart of a mountain, it would enter and cause him to die.” He said: I heard it from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), who said: “There will be left the most evil of people who will be as swift as birds and be as vicious as wild animals. They will not acknowledge any good or denounce any evil. Then the Shaytan will appear to them and will say: Will you not listen to me? They will say: What do you command us to do? So he will command them to worship idols, but despite that they will have ample provision and a good life. Then the Trumpet will be blown and no one will hear it but he will tilt his head to one side. The first one to hear it will be a man who is fixing the trough for his camels. He will swoon and all the people will swoon. …\xa0\xa0\nWith regard to the Trumpet blast which will signal the resurrection, it will come when all the people are dead, then they will all be resurrected, believers and disbelievers alike. This is what will happen at the second Trumpet blast, at which people will rise from their graves. As for the beginning of the Hour, the end of this world and the beginning of the next world, that will come at the first Trumpet blast, which is the one which will make all people swoon; they will be the most evil of people, the last of humanity who will still be alive at that time.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation and meaning):\n{The Trumpet will be blown and all those who are in the heavens and on earth will swoon, except whomever Allah wills. Then it will be blown again, whereupon they will be standing, looking around}\xa0[Al-Zumar 39:68].\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/429057/how-can-the-hour-come-upon-the-worst-of-people-when-the-trumpet-blast-will-come-when-people-are-dead
93031,"My father bought machines from a non-Muslim, knowing that they were stolen. What is the Islamic point of view concerning that? And what is the ruling on the money that I took from him and used for business?","['Praise be to Allah.Is it permissible to buy stolen goods?\nIt is not permissible to buy stolen goods – even if they were stolen from non-Muslims. This is property that is prohibited in and of itself, because it is not permissible for anyone to take possession of it, even if that is by a legitimate means such as buying it, being given it as a gift or inheriting it.\nThe person who is aware that the item they intend to purchase is stolen should denounce the thief and encourage them to repent from stealing, and to return the goods to their owner. He should try to return the goods to their owner if possible and if he knows who they are, or he should tell them where the stolen goods are, or tell the authorities about that.\xa0\nThe one who buys something knowing that it is stolen is sinning, and part of his repentance is returning it to its owner and returning its price to the one to whom he sold it.\xa0\nBuying from the thief is helping him in sin and transgression, and is encouraging the thief to carry on with what he is doing as well as failing to denounce evil. One of the conditions of a sale being valid is that the seller should be the owner of what he is selling. If he is a thief then he is not the owner, which implies that the transaction is not valid.\nScholars’ Fatwa on the prohibition of buying stolen goods\nThere follow some fatwas of scholars on what we have stated above:\xa0\n\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n\n“With regard to property that has been stolen or seized by illegitimate means and then sold in a proper manner, it does not become permissible for the one who bought it. If the Muslim knows about it then he should avoid it. If I know that a person stole some property, or he betrayed a trust or usurped it and took it from someone by force and unlawfully, then it is not permissible for me to take it from him, whether as a gift or in payment when buying or as payment of wages or as payment of a debt. This wealth is the property of the one who has been wronged ."" (Majmu` Al-Fatawa\xa0 29/323)\xa0\n\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) also said:\xa0 \xa0\n\n“If the one who is with them – the Tatars – or with anyone else has property that he knows they seized unlawfully from one whose wealth is protected in Shari`ah, then it is not permissible to buy it, but if it is bought in order to salvage it from them, then it should be returned to its owners if possible, otherwise it should be spent in the Muslims’ interests, and that is permissible."" (Majmu` Al-Fatawa\xa0 29/276)\n\nThe scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas said:\n\n“If a person is certain that a product offered for sale is stolen or seized by force, or that the one who is offering it for sale is not the legitimate owner, and is not authorized to sell it, then it is prohibited for him to buy it, because buying it is cooperating in sin and transgression. And that is also wronging people and approving of evil, and taking part in the sin. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \xa0\n“Help you one another in virtue, righteousness and piety; but do not help one another in sin and transgression.”\xa0[Al-Ma’idah 5:2]\nBased on that, the one who knows that this product is stolen or seized by force should advise the one who stole it , kindly and gently and with wisdom, to stop stealing. If he does not give it up and he persists in his crimes, then he should inform the authorities about that so that the wrongdoer may be punished and the property restored to its owners. That is cooperating in righteousness and piety, as well as deterring wrongdoers from doing wrong, and being sincere to him by stopping him and being supportive to those who have been wronged.\nHence it is proven in the Hadith which Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Support your brother whether he is a wrongdoer or the one who is wronged.” They said: O Messenger of Allah, we can support him if he is wronged, but how can we support him if he is the wrongdoer? He said: “By stopping him.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari)\nA similar report was narrated by Imam Ahmad in his Musnad. According to another report a man said: O Messenger of Allah, I can support him if he is wronged, but if he is a wrongdoer, how can I support him? He said: “Deter him from doing wrong, for that is supporting him.”\nIn light of that, supporting the wrongdoer means deterring him from his wrong deeds and transgressions, and supporting the one who has been wronged means striving to restore his rights. Preventing the wrongdoer from being able to do harm is a communal obligation. If there is no one who can do that in an official capacity or who is stronger than him and can stop the wrongdoers and sinners and deter them from their wrongdoing and crimes, then it becomes an individual responsibility, depending on one’s strength and ability, to be done with kindness and gentleness, and one will be rewarded for that in Sha Allah.” (Shaykh ‘Abd Al-‘Aziz ibn Baz, Shaykh ‘Abd Al-‘Aziz Al Ash-Shaykh, Shaykh Salih Al-Fawzan, Shaykh Bakr Abu Zayd, Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 13/82, 83)\xa0\n\nShaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\xa0\n\nI was offered something for sale and it was clear to me that it was stolen, but the one who offered it to me was not the thief, rather he had bought it from someone else who had bought it from the thief. If I bought it even though I knew that, would I be sinning, even though I do not know who the owner is from whom it was stolen?\xa0\nHe replied:\xa0\n“It seems from the Shar`i evidence that it is not permissible for you to buy it if it is clear to you or you think that most likely it is stolen, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \xa0\xa0\n“but do not help one another in sin and transgression”\xa0[Al-Ma’idah 5:2] and because you know or think that most likely the seller is not the legitimate owner and does not have permission to sell it. So how can you help him in his wrongdoing and take the property of someone else unlawfully? Yes, if you can buy it in order to save it and return it to its owner , there is nothing wrong with that, if it is not possible to seize it by force and punish the wrongdoer. However, if it is possible to take it by force and punish the wrongdoer in accordance with Shari’ah, this is what must be done, because of the well known evidence in the Hadith: “Support your brother whether he is a wrongdoer or has been wronged…” (Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 19/91-92)\xa0\nRuling on taking wealth from the father who used to buy stolen goods\nAs for you taking wealth from your father , there is nothing wrong with that, because if a person’s wealth is mixed and includes both prohibited and permissible wealth, there is nothing wrong with interacting with him by buying, selling, exchanging gifts, loans and so on. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) dealt with the Jews who consumed Riba and prohibited wealth.\xa0\nBut if the wealth that you take from your father is the actual stolen property , then it is not permissible for your father or for you.\xa0\nFinally, you should advise your father to seek that which is permissible and avoid that which is prohibited, for every body that is nourished with something prohibited, the Fire is more befitting for it.\xa0\nWe ask Allah to make you independent of means by that which He has permitted so that you will have no need of that which He has forbidden, by His bounty.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/93031/is-it-prohibited-in-islam-to-buy-stolen-goods
470736,"Which is better, to slaughter an animal (with the intention of giving the meat in charity) in my country or in a country that is poorer?","['Praise be to Allah.If you have relatives and neighbours in your country who are poor, then giving voluntary charity to them is better, and starting with them is better. The religious texts give precedence to them and encourage us to start with them.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Say: Whatever good you spend should be for parents, kindred, orphans and those in need, and for wayfarers, and whatever good you do, Allah is aware of it}[Al-Baqarah 2:215].\nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “A dinar that you spend for the sake of Allah, a dinar that you spend to free a slave, a dinar that you give in charity to a needy person and a dinar that you spend on your family – the greatest of them in reward is the one that you spend on your family.” Narrated by Muslim (995).\nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed us to give charity, and a man said: O Messenger of Allah, I have a dinar. He said: “Give it in charity to yourself.” He said: I have another. He said: “Give it in charity to your child.” He said: I have another. He said: “Give it in charity to your wife – or he said: your spouse.” He said: I have another. He said: “Give it in charity to your servant.” He said: I have another. He said: “You know best [to whom to give it].” Narrated by Abu Dawud (1691).\nAl-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The ummah is unanimously agreed that charity given to relatives is better than that given to outsiders, the hadiths which speak of this matter are many and well-known. Our companions said: With regard to it being recommended to give voluntary charity to relatives and give them precedence over outsiders, it makes no difference whether the relative is one on whom you are obliged to spend or not. Al-Baghawi said: Giving it to a relative on whom you are obliged to spend is better than giving it to an outsider.""(Al-Majmu‘\xa0 6/238).\nSecondly:\nIf the reasons to give precedence to those mentioned above are not there, then undoubtedly finding another country that is poorer to slaughter an animal there, with the intention of giving its meat in charity, is more appropriate. Hence we see that the verse of zakah gives precedence to those in the greatest need and starts with them. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Zakah [alms] is only for the poor and those in need; those who work to collect it; those whose hearts are to be won over; for the freeing of slaves; for debtors; for the cause of Allah; and for stranded wayfarers. [Thus it is] ordained by Allah, and Allah is All-Knowing, Most Wise}[Al-Tawbah 9:60].\nThus the verse begins with the poor, who are the most in need.\nTherefore a number of scholars allowed sending obligatory zakah to a country that is poorer and in greater need, so it is more appropriate that sending voluntary charity should be permissible.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: There is no shar‘i evidence for defining a limit on the distance beyond which zakah cannot be sent and saying that it is the distance at which shortening the prayers becomes permissible. It is permissible to transfer zakah, and whatever comes under the same ruling, for a shar‘i reason.""(Taqrib Fatawa Ibn Taymiyah\xa0 3/514).\nIt says in a fatwa of the Permanent Committee: “The basic principle regarding zakah is that it should be given to the poor in the city where the wealth is, because of the hadith quoted, but if there is a need to send it elsewhere, such as if the poor people in the country to which it is sent are in greater need, or they are relatives of the one who wants to give it, in addition to being poor, or for some similar reason, it is permissible to transfer it.""(Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Da’imah\xa010/9).\nShaykh al-Sa‘di (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The giver should seek out needy people to give his charity to, and he should not give it to a needy person when there is someone in greater need than him.""(Tafsir al-Sa‘di\xa0 p. 116).\nBased on that, if there are people in the country in which you want to slaughter the animal with the intention of giving its meat in charity who are in greater need than those in your city, because of calamities, war and the like, then it is better to slaughter the animal there, not because the price is cheaper, but in order to meet the need of those who have been stricken by poverty or because some disaster has destroyed the wealth of the Muslims. In the case of voluntary charity, the matter is more flexible.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/470736/can-he-slaughter-an-animal-with-the-intention-of-giving-the-meat-in-charity-in-his-own-country-or-can-he-choose-a-poorer-country
257369,"I have read your articles having to do with Mani and Madhi, but up till now I cannot differentiate properly between them, which is causing me some anxiety, especially since I have read what you say, then I have read other Fatwas, and it is still not clear to me. Is it possible to explain in more detail?","['Praise be to Allah.What is Mani (semen)?\nWhat comes out of a woman may be Mani, Madhi or regular discharge, which is called “moisture”. Each of these has its own characteristics and rulings that apply to it.\xa0\nWith regard to Mani , its characteristics are as follows:\xa0\n\nIt is thin and yellow. This is the description that is narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “The water of the man (semen) is thick and white, and the water of the woman is thin and yellow.” (Narrated by Muslim, 311) However, it may be white for some women.\xa0\nIt smells like pollen when it is still wet, and the smell of date-tree pollen is similar to the smell of dough. Its smell after it has dried is like that of egg whites.\nThere is pleasure and desire when it is emitted, and desire ceases immediately after it is emitted.\n\nIt is not stipulated that all three characteristics appear at once, rather one is sufficient to rule that it is Mani. This was stated by An-Nawawi in Al-Majmu` (2/141).\xa0\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “With regard to the Mani of the woman, it is yellow and thin, or it may be white.\nIt has two characteristics and may be known by one of them:\n\nThe first is that its smell is like the smell of a man’s Mani [which smells like dough].\nThe second is that pleasure is felt when it is emitted, and the pleasure dissipates immediately after its emission [and is followed by languidity]."" (Sharh Muslim\xa0 3/222)\n\nWhat is Madhi?\nWith regard to Madhi, it is white (clear) and sticky, and is emitted when thinking of or wanting intercourse, but no pleasure is felt when it is emitted, and it is not followed by languidity.\xa0\xa0\nThis applies to both men and women. It may be said that it applies more to women than men.\nWhat is moisture?\nWith regard to moisture , this is the discharge that comes from the uterus; it is clear and a woman may not notice it. Women vary in the amount they emit.\xa0\nThus it is clear that the issue of Mani is not confusing, because it has a distinctive smell, and because it is emitted as a result of desire and pleasure is felt when it is emitted. Madhi and moisture do not have that smell.\nHowever, Madhi is emitted after thinking, looking and so on, i.e., after there is desire, although it is not accompanied by desire and pleasure at the time of emission; rather a person may not be aware of it when it is emitted.\nMani is accompanied by desire and pleasure; Madhi is preceded by desire but is not accompanied by that at the time of emission.\nAs for moisture, it is something regular that is not connected to thinking or looking, and is not preceded by desire.\nWhat is most likely with regard to what is mentioned above is that it is Madhi, because it is emitted after thinking about that which provokes desire.\nIf it is not connected to thinking, then it is secretions and moisture.\nAre Mani and Madhi pure?\n\nMani is pure and Ghusl is required after emitting it .\nMadhi is impure and invalidates Wudu , and it must be washed off one’s clothes and body.\nMoisture is pure but it invalidates Wudu.\n\nWhat to do if you are not sure about what has been emitted?\nIf a person is not sure whether what has been emitted is Mani or Madhi, he has the choice to decide what it is, and then should apply the appropriate ruling to it. This is the view of Ash-Shafi‘i (may Allah have mercy on him) and it makes matters easier for the questioner and for anyone who is suffering from Waswasah (whispers from the satan or intrusive thoughts).\nIt says in Mughni Al-Muhtaj (1/215): “If it is possible that what has been emitted may be Mani or may be something else, such as Wadiyy or Madhi, then he may choose and decide which one it is, according to the correct opinion. If he decides that it is Mani then he must do Ghusl; if he decides it is something else then he must do Wudu and wash off whatever has got onto him, because if he decides that it is one of these things, then [by doing what is appropriate in that case] he will definitely have dealt with the matter appropriately. As for the other two things that it could be, in principle they have not happened and he does not have to worry about them.”\nWhat to do if you suffer from occasional emission of Madhi?\xa0\nWhat appears to be the case from your question is that you are affected by Waswasah (whispers from the satan or intrusive thoughts). Our advice to you is that you should ignore it and not pay any attention to it. Do not look at your garment or check to see whether anything came out or not. Rather the one who is affected by Waswasah is advised to sprinkle water on his or her private part and underwear, and if any wetness is seen, then he or she will think that it is the traces of the water that he or she sprinkled on it. Thus the Waswasah will be dispelled in sha Allah.\nShaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“If someone suffers from occasional emission of Madhi, then he may deal with it by making sure to wash it off when cleaning himself [after relieving himself], and sprinkling water around his private part when doing Wudu. Then after that, if intrusive thoughts (Waswaas) come to him, he should say to himself that this is part of the water that he sprinkled so that he may be certain that nothing came out of him.\nSo long as you have the slightest uncertainty, you should ignore this matter and not touch your underwear or check anything.\nHowever, if this moisture is present all the time, then this is more akin to incontinence, so you have to do Wudu when the time for prayer begins, and pray according to your situation, if the Madhi is constant.\nNonetheless, if it only happens sometimes when going out of the house, then it is like urine or wind: if anything comes out, it invalidates Wudu, and if nothing comes out, then praise be to Allah.\nSo long as you feel any uncertainty, even if it is only a little, even if it is only one percent, then do not pay any attention to this matter, and you should regard it as something imaginary that is not true.""(Majmu` Fatawa Ibn Baz\xa0 29/20)\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/257369/the-difference-between-mani-madhi-and-other-secretions
