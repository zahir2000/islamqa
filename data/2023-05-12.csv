223615,"I heard a hadith which says that a man came to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and said: How much I have sinned! And the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) told him: “Say: O Allah, surely Your forgiveness is greater than my sins and I have great hope in Your mercy, so, O Lord, forgive me” – and he told him to repeat it three times. What are the supplications for forgiveness from sins? What are the supplications that will strengthen faith and ward off intrusive thoughts (waswasah)?","[""Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIn the answers to questions no. 3177 and 39775 , we have listed a number of supplications having to do with repentance and seeking forgiveness.\nSecondly:\nFaith increases by doing acts of worship and righteous deeds, and it decreases by committing sins. So whoever wants to increase his faith, let him focus on obeying Allah and let him avoid disobeying Him. What will help him to do that is spending time with righteous people and keeping away from innovators and sinners.\nAmong the most important means that will help the Muslim to do that are the following:\n*Offering supplication and asking Allah to make you steadfast in adhering to His religion:\nAllah, may He be exalted, tells us that the people of knowledge and faith say: (interpretation of the meaning):\n{[Who say], “Our Lord, let not our hearts deviate after You have guided us and grant us from Yourself mercy. Indeed, You are the Bestower”}[Aal ‘Imran 3:8].\nAhmad narrated in al-Musnad (23463) that ‘A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) often used to say in his supplication: “Ya muqallib al-quloob thabbit qalbi 'ala deenik (O Controller of the hearts, make my heart adhere firmly to Your religion).” I said: O Messenger of Allah, how often you offer this supplication. He said: “Man’s heart is between two of the fingers of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted; if He wills, He causes it to deviate, and if He wills, He causes it to be guided.” At-Tirmidhi narrated it from Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) and classed it as hasan. It was also classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih at-Tirmidhi.\n*At-Tirmidhi (3599) narrated – and classed it as hasan – that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sins and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Allahumm anfa‘ni bima ‘allamtani wa ‘allimni ma yanfa‘uni wa zidni ‘ilma (O Allah, benefit me by means of that which You have taught me, and teach me that which will benefit me, and increase me in knowledge).” Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih at-Tirmidhi. Whomever Allah increases in knowledge, his faith will grow stronger.\nAhmad (3797) narrated from Ibn Mas‘ud (may Allah be pleased with him) that he was in the mosque, offering supplication, and that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came in whilst he was offering supplication. He said: “Ask, you will be given,” when he [Ibn Mas‘ud] was saying: O Allah, I ask You for faith that does not waver, blessing that does not end and to accompany the Prophet (sa) in the highest station in Paradise, the Paradise of eternity. Whomever Allah gives faith that does not waver is strong in faith, and it will not be weakened by desires or doubts.\n*Asking Allah, may He be exalted, for guidance\nMuslim (2725) narrated that ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to me: “Say: Allahumm ahdini wa saddidni (O Allah, guide me and make me steadfast).\nMuslim (2721) also narrated from Ibn Mas‘ud (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to say: “Allahumma inni as’aluk al-huda wa’t-tuqa wa’l-‘afafa wa’l-ghina (O Allah, I ask You for guidance, piety, abstinence and independence of means).”\n*Offering concise supplications, asking Allah for all that is good and seeking refuge with Him from all that is bad, as Ibn Majah (3846) narrated from ‘A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) taught her the following supplication: “Allahumma inni as’aluka min al-khayri kullihi, ‘ajilihi wa ajilihi, ma ‘alimtu minhu wa ma lam a’lam. Wa a‘udhu bika min ash-sharri kullihi, ‘ajilihi wa ajilihi, ma ‘alimtu minhu wa ma lam a’lam. Allahumma inni as’aluka min khayri ma sa’alaka ‘abduka wa nabiyyuka, wa a‘udhu bika min sharri ma ‘adha bihi ‘abduka wa nabiyyuka. Allahumma inni as’aluka al-jannata wa ma qarraba ilayha min qawlin aw ‘amal, wa a‘udhu bika min al-naari wa ma qarraba ilayha min qawlin aw ‘amal, wa as’aluka an taj‘al kulla qadaa’in qadaytahu li khayran (O Allah, I ask You for all that is good, now and in the future, what I know of it and what I do not know. And I seek refuge with You from all evil, now and in the future, what I know and what I do not know.\xa0 O Allah, I ask You for the good that Your slave and Prophet asked You for, and I seek refuge with You from the evil from which Your slave and Prophet sought refuge. O Allah, I ask You for Paradise and for that which brings one closer to it, in word and deed, and I seek refuge in You from Hell and from that which brings one closer to it, in word and deed. And I ask You to make every decree that You decree concerning me good).” Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah.\n*Asking Allah, may He be exalted, to renew faith in our hearts. Al-Hakim (5) narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘As (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Faith wears out in the heart of one of you as a garment wears out, so ask Allah to renew faith in your hearts.” Classed as hasan by al-Albani in as-Sahihah (1585).\nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 14041 .\nThirdly:\nThe remedy for intrusive thoughts (waswas) is to ignore them and turn away from them; to recite a great deal of Qur’an; to do great deal of righteous deeds; and to call upon Allah, may He be glorified, and beseech Him to ward off the schemes of the Shaytan from you and to make you steadfast in adhering to the truth.\nSee also the answer to question no. 102851 .\nSupplications that are beneficial in warding off the intrusive whispers of the Shaytan (waswas) include the following:\n*Seeking refuge with Allah from him. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And if an evil suggestion comes to you from Satan, then seek refuge in Allah. Indeed, He is Hearing and Knowing}[al-A‘raf 7:200].\n*Asking Allah for protection from it. Ibn Majah (773) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When any one of you enters the mosque, let him send salaams upon the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), then let him say, Allahumm aftah li abwaba rahmatika (O Allah, open to me the gates of Your mercy). And when he leaves let him send salaams upon the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and say Allahumm i‘simni min ash-shaytan ir-rajeem (O Allah, protect me from the accursed Shaytan).” Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah.\n*Seeking refuge with Allah from the incitements of the devils, lest they be present with one:\n{And say, “My Lord, I seek refuge in You from the incitements of the devils\nAnd I seek refuge in You, my Lord, lest they be present with me”}[al-Mu’minoon 23:97-98].\n*Asking Allah to subdue the Shaytan. Abu Dawud (5054) narrated from Abu’l-Azhar al-Anmari (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Bismillahi wada‘tu janbi. Allahumm ighfir li dhanbi wa akhsi’ shaytani wa fukka rihani waj‘alni fi’n-nadiyy il-a‘la (In the name of Allah I lay down on my side. O Allah, forgive me my sins, drive away my shaytaan, help me to fulfil my obligations and join me with the highest assembly).” Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud.\nFourthly:\nThe hadith mentioned in the question is a da‘if (weak) hadith. It was narrated by al-Hakim in al-Mustadrak (1944) via ‘Ubaydullah ibn Muhammad ibn Hunayn: ‘Ubaydullah ibn Muhammad ibn Jabir ibn ‘Abdillah told me, from his father, from his grandfather, who said: A man came to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and said: How much I have sinned, how much I have sinned! – he said these words two or three times. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to him: “Say: O Allah, surely Your forgiveness is greater than my sins and my hope in Your mercy is great er than my hope in my deeds.” The man said it, then [the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)] said: “Say it again,” so he said it again. Then he said: “Say it again,” so he said it again. Then he said: “Get up, for Allah has forgiven you.” Al-Albani classed this hadith as da‘if in Silsilat al-Ahadith ad-Da‘ifah (9/58).\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/223615/supplications-to-strengthen-faith-and-ward-off-intrusive-thoughts-waswasah
120672,"How can I deal with interference from my husband’s family in my personal affairs? Is it regarded as bad manners if I answer them back, because they are of the type that will persists if I keep quiet? Allah alone knows that I have ignored their interference and attempts to provoke me many times, but it seems that ignoring them is not working, because they persist in asking questions. By Allah, O shaykh, one of my husband’s sisters was talking about polygamy, when my husband was sitting next to me, and she said: What’s wrong with you marrying another one? And I was sitting right there, and she did not care about my feelings. At that time I was newly married, and was visiting them. By Allah, they knew nothing about me then to justify saying such things. If my husband praises me for something that I did – which is something that rarely happens in front of them – she says: That is her duty. All of this happened in front of me, and – by Allah – I never uttered a single word, because we, my sisters and I, were raised not to answer back to the one who mistreats us. I even do not know how to respond politely, except very rarely, and afterwards I feel guilty. I could say a lot about their interference and questions, even with regard to breastfeeding my child, and the place where bathe him, and his personal hygiene. According to my husband’s testimony, I do not neglect him or fall short in taking care of him. Even their children repeat the same questions, to the extent that I hate going and visiting them, and when I visit them I do not show that I am upset. Sometimes she says hurtful or embarrassing things, and I act normally, but I am very angry inside. Moreover, my husband said: If you tell anyone about the way my family treats you, I shall ask you about it before Allah. With regard to her questions, I have already spoken with my sister and my brother’s wife about the things they do and the way they treat me. They – Allah knows – are wise and they told me: Answer back politely regarding the things that you cannot keep quiet about, and whatever you can ignore, ignore it. Will I be sinning if I do that? Does my husband have the right to warn me not to speak about the way they treat me to anyone, even though any person would need to discuss his problems and concerns with someone so that he can get it off his chest. By Allah, I feel so suppressed that I do not like to see them or hear their voices, because I become very angry, even with my husband; I have become hot-tempered and I hate to treat him roughly. I understand that he does not want the image of his family to be tarnished in anyone’s eyes, but I have the right to seek advice from people who are older than me and have more experience in life. Is it permissible for me to consult and express my concerns to someone who is trustworthy, or must I remain suppressed and angry? How can I deal with my husband and his family in a way that is pleasing to Allah and does not trample my rights or overstep the mark in my relationship with them? Because many families break up when one of the two party oversteps the mark in dealing with the other party, and when troubles are not contained. Is it permissible for me to refuse to live near his family, so as to avoid problems?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThere are many problems that may arise between the wife and her husband’s family. In order to solve any problem, we should examine the causes before anything else:\n1. \xa0The causes may be connected to the attitude of the husband’s family. There are some people for whom causing trouble is second nature, and they make mountains out of molehills and exaggerate about trivial, insignificant matters. But when people are like this, problems do not exist only between them and their son’s wife; rather they have troubles with everyone. Solving this problem requires a great deal of effort to teach them right from wrong and good from evil, and to educate them about faith and obedience to Allah. In this case, the husband who is aware of his family’s nature and attitude should not pay any attention to what they say about his wife, and he should not attach any significance to it. Rather he should try to advise his family and call them to what is good, and he should comfort his wife if she suffers mistreatment at the hands of his family.\n2.\xa0The cause of troubles may be the fault of both sides: jealousy that takes root in the hearts of the husband’s family, when they see how fond he is of his wife and how he shows compassion to her. The solution to this problem is compensating them by showing extra compassion and special care towards them and giving them a lot of gifts, whilst not showing affection to his wife in front of them. Moreover, the husband should pay special attention towards them, and offer a great deal of supplication asking Allah to remove the jealousy from their hearts.\n3.The cause of these problems may be what the husband’s family see in the wife of falling short with their son, or with her children, or in taking care of her house, or what she demonstrates of shameful behaviour by not showing respect to their mother, and other things that could be real – not made-up – in many wives. This is the silver lining to these problems, because through it the wife may come to realise her shortcomings and negligence, and thus be able to make up for her shortcomings and rectify the situation, for the wife cannot claim to be perfect in her behaviour and attitude. This is the easiest cause of such problems to fix, because the solution is easy and possible; the wife can rectify herself and mend the relationship between her and her husband’s family by improving her behaviour and giving each person his or her due of respect. Thus she will be able to rectify the situation, resolve the problem and gain her husband’s appreciation.\nSecondly:\nWhat we think is that the wife should obey her husband if he tells her not to tell anyone else of what happens between her and his family. This decision on the husband’s part serves an important interest that surpasses the interest of the wife venting and getting things off her chest. That is because if, in such cases, the problems become widely known, everyone will have an opinion or will use it to come up with some scheme, or will give bad advice for solving these problems, which will only make matters worse and create further problems, and will generate more causes of trouble, with the result that it may become very difficult to find a solution after that.\nIt is permissible for the wife to complain to a wise person, and that does not come under the heading of backbiting, which is prohibited. See the answer to question no. 7660. At the same time, the husband has the right to prevent her from doing this permissible thing, if he thinks that there is a legitimate purpose to be served by that.\nWhat we think is that you made a mistake by not complying with his advice, and speaking to your sister and your brother’s wife about what has been going on between you and your husband’s family. In order to rectify that, you must repent and seek forgiveness, and not carry on talking to them about this matter. You should urge them not to tell anyone else about anything that you told them. There is no need to confess to your husband what you did, because it will serve no purpose; rather it could result in more trouble. For example, he could start resenting you and what you did; or he could prevent you from speaking to your sister and your brother’s wife at all. All of that is possible, because the Shaytan is always present and has a great impact at such times, for he will fan the flames, exacerbate the matter and will do his utmost to create enmity and resentment because of this trouble.\nThirdly:\nDealing with your husband and his family requires great wisdom on your part. But you – in sha Allah – are able to cope with that, as is quite evident to us from your saying “because we, my sisters and I, were raised not to answer back to the one who mistreats us. I even do not know how to respond politely, except very rarely, and afterwards I feel guilty” and from your other comment “and when I visit them I do not show that I am upset. Sometimes she says hurtful or embarrassing things, and I act normally, but I am very angry inside.” This is a thing that no one can do except one who has self-control, and no one can do that except wise people.\nWhat is required of you now is the following:\n\nIgnore what you hear from your husband’s\xa0 family which you can tell is aimed at upsetting and provoking you and is pure fabrication, with no substance.\nPay attention to yourself, your house, your children and whatever you hear from them that is true [in terms of shortcomings]; you have to rectify these things and do them properly.\nTry to be friendly towards his family, showing good manners, speaking gently and behaving kindly. Make sure to give them appropriate gifts from time to time, or some food that you have made for them, or some sweets that you have made specially for them. For it is well known that gifts have a great impact in bringing people together and spreading love and affection between them.\nBe kind to your husband by not telling anyone about how his family treat you, and make him trust you more; do not let him hear or see anything from you that he does not like.\nHowever, that does not mean that you should keep completely quiet about fabricated accusations that may be made against you. But we advise you to refer that to your husband, and let him take responsibility for putting things right and giving each person their due. Show him that your family raised you well.\nFinally, there is nothing wrong with suggesting to your husband that you should move away and not live close to his family. However, he is not obliged to respond. Your right is only to have separate accommodation, and you already have that. But wisdom and your best interests dictate that the husband should move further away from his family, if he realises that there is no harmony between them and his wife. Perhaps moving away may contribute to strengthening the bonds between all parties, and may remove some of these ill feelings and resentment from everyone’s hearts.\n\nSeek the help of Allah your Lord by offering supplication, and doing the duties that are required of you. We ask Allah, may He be exalted, to enable you to do that which pleases Him, and to reconcile between you all.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/120672/causes-of-problems-between-the-wife-and-her-husbands-family-and-ways-to-solve-them
