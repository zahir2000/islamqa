334348,"How authentic is the following hadith? The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There will come a time for my ummah when humility will disappear. There will come a time when sudden death becomes widespread. There will come a time when there will be many earthquakes. There will come a time when the Muslim will only greet those whom he knows. There will come a time when there will be a great deal of killing. And there will come a time when everyone will boast of his sins.” It was said: When will that be, O Messenger of Allah? He said: “That will happen at the end of time, so when it happens, expect the onset of the Hour.”","['Praise be to Allah.We could not find any hadith which referred to all of that with this exact wording.\nBut with regard to what is mentioned in it, there are numerous narrations of various hadiths.\nFirstly:\nWith regard to the disappearance of humility\nThis is what was narrated by Jubayr ibn Nufayr, from `Awf ibn Malik, that he said: Whilst we were sitting with the Messenger of Allah one day, he looked at the sky, then he said: “This is the time when knowledge will be taken up and will disappear.”\nAn Ansari man who was called Ziyad ibn Labid said: Will knowledge be taken up, O Messenger of Allah, when the Book of Allah is among us and we have taught it to our children and womenfolk?\nThe Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “I always thought that you were one of the most knowledgeable of the people of Madinah.” Then he mentioned how the People of the Book had gone astray despite what they had of the Book of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted.\nJubayr ibn Nufayr met Shaddad ibn Aws in the prayer place and told him about this hadith from `Awf ibn Malik, and he said: `Awf spoke the truth. Then he said: Do you know what it means for knowledge to be taken up?\nHe said: I said: I do not know. He said: It means the loss of its vessels [that is, the scholars]. He said: Do you know what type of knowledge will be taken up first? He said: I said: I do not know. He said: Humility, to the extent that you will hardly ever see anyone who is humble.\n(Narrated by Imam Ahmad in al-Musnad, 39/417-418, and al-Hakim in al-Mustadrak, 1/98-99. Al-Hakim classed it as authentic and adh-Dhahabi agreed with him)\nSecondly: With regard to the appearance of sudden death\nThis was narrated by at-Tabarani in al-Mu`jam as-Saghir, 1132 and al-Mu`jam al-Awsat, 9/147. He said: al-Haytham ibn Khalid al-Missisi told us, ‘Abd al-Kabir ibn al-Mu`afa ibn `Imran told us, Sharik told us, on the authority of al-`Abbas ibn Dhurayh, on the authority of ash-Sha`bi, from Anas ibn Malik, who attributed it to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), who said: “When the Hour is nigh, the new moon will be seen easily as soon as it appears, so it will be said that it is two nights old. Mosques will be treated as thoroughfares and sudden death will become widespread.”\nAl-Haytham ibn Khalid al-Missisi is unreliable.\nAdh-Dhahabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nal-Haytham ibn Khalid al-Missisi, on the authority of ‘Abd al-Karim ibn al-Mu`afa. Ad-Daraqutni said: He is unreliable. (End quote from al-Mughni fi’d-Du`afa’, 2/716).\nYusuf ibn Sa`id ibn Muslim followed him in that, as ad-Diya’ al-Maqdisi stated in al-Mukhtarah, 2325, when he said:\nShihab ibn Mahmud al-Hatimi told us in Herat that `Abd as-Salam ibn Ahmad ibn Isma`il informed them: Muhammad ibn Abi Mas`ud al-Farisi informed us: `Abd ar-Rahman ibn Abi Shurayh stated that it was said to him: Yahya ibn Muhammad ibn Sa`id told us, Yusuf ibn Sa`id ibn Muslim told us, ‘Abd al-Kabir ibn al-Mu`afa told us, Sharik told us, on the authority of al-`Abbas ibn Dhurayh, on the authority of ash-Sha`bi, on the authority of Anas, that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When the Hour is nigh, the new moon will be seen when it is one night old, but it will be said that it is two nights old. Sudden death will become widespread, and mosques will be taken as thoroughfares.”\nBut this isnad centres around Sharik, and Sharik is not a reliable narrator when he is the only narrator and there are no corroborating reports. Ibn al-Ja`d narrated this report from him with a mursal isnad. al-Baghawi narrated in Musnad Ibn al-Ja`d, 2489: `Ali told us, Sharik told us, on the authority of al-`Abbas ibn Dhurayh, on the authority of `Amir – ash-Sha`bi – attributing it to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that he said: “When the Hour is nigh, the new moon will be seen easily as soon as it appears, so it will be said that it is two nights old. A man will pass through the mosque without praying two rak`ahs in it, and sudden death [will become widespread].”\nHammad ibn Salamah narrated a mursal report which was similar to that of Sharik on the authority of `Asim ibn Bahdalah, as ad-Dani narrated in as-Sunan al-Waridah fi’l-Fitan, 4/789.\nAd-Dani said: `Ali ibn Muhammad ibn `Abdillah told us, `Abdullah ibn Masrur told us, `Abdullah ibn Sahl al-Andalusi told us, on the authority of Muhammad ibn Yahya, on the authority of his father, on the authority of Hammad ibn Salamah, on the authority of `Asim ibn Bahdalah, on the authority of ash-Sha`bi, that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “One of the portents of the Hour will be sudden death.”\nHe also narrated it via another isnad.\nShaykh al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThis isnad is mursal (meaning that the name of the Sahabi is omitted) and sound. Muhammad ibn Yahya is Ibn Sa`id ibn Farrukh al-Qattan, who is trustworthy.\nRegarding his father, he was a trustworthy, leading scholar of hadith, and the narrators after them are well known. (End quote from as-Silsilah as-Sahihah, 5/370).\nIt says in `Ilal ad-Daraqutni, 12/163:\nHe was asked about the hadith of `Amir ash-Sha`bi, on the authority of Anas, according to which the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When the Hour is nigh, the new moon will be seen easily as soon as it appears, so it will be said that it is two nights old. Mosques will be taken as thoroughfares, and sudden death will become widespread.”\nHe said: It was narrated by `Abd al-Kabir ibn al-Mu`afa, on the authority of Sharik, on the authority of al-`Abbas ibn Dhurayh, on the authority of ash-Sha`bi, on the authority of Anas, on the authority of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nOthers narrated it on the authority of ash-Sha`bi, as a mursal report (meaning that the name of the Sahabi is omitted from the isnad). End quote.\nIt was narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah in al-Musannaf, 7/199, from ash-Sha`bi, but without attributing it to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nIbn Abi Shaybah said: `Abd ar-Rahim ibn Sulayman told us, on the authority of Mujalid, on the authority of ash-Sha`bi, who said: It was said that when the Hour draws nigh, sudden death [will become widespread].\nBut its isnad includes Mujalid, who is somewhat unreliable.\nAdh-Dhahabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nMujalid ibn Sa`id al-Hamdani al-Akhbari, on the authority of ash-Sha`bi and Qays ibn Abi Hazim, and his son Isma`il, narrated on the authority of him, Shu`bah and al-Qattan. Ibn Ma`in classed him as unreliable. An-Nasa’i said: He is not reliable, and on one occasion he said: He is trustworthy. (End quote from al-Kashif, 2/239)\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nMujalid ibn Sa`id ibn `Umayr al-Hamdani, Abu `Amr al-Kufi, is not reliable. He changed at the end of his life. (End quote from Taqrib al-Tahdhib, p. 520).\nIt was narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah in al-Musannaf, 7/200, from Mujahid.\nHe said: Muhammad ibn Bishr told us: I heard Mujahid ibn Abi Rashid say: Mujahid said: One of the portents of the Hour will be sudden death.\nIts isnad includes Mujahid ibn Abi Rashid.\nYahya ibn Ma`in classed him as trustworthy in Riwayat Ibn Tahman, p. 82.\nIn Tarikh Ibn Ma`in – Riwayat ad-Duri, 3/494, it says:\nAl-`Abbas told us, `Uthman ibn Abi Shaybah told me, Muhammad ibn Bishr al-`Abdi told me, on the authority of Mujahid ibn Rumi, on the authority of Mujahid, who said: The Hour will not begin until there is a great deal of tiraz. It was said: What is tiraz? He said: Sudden death.\nI narrated it to Yahya ibn Ma`in and told him that `Uthman had narrated it to me, and Yahya said: No, by Allah! Muhammad ibn Bishr did not hear anything at all from Mujahid ibn Rumi. This is a man from whom Sufyan and others like him narrated, but perhaps Ibn Bishr narrated it to them as a mursal report (meaning that the name of the Sahabi is omitted from the isnad). (End quote).\nTo sum up, this report does not have a unbroken chain of narration going all the way back to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), but its meaning is applicable to the situation at the end of time, when there will be many sins and punishments. Perhaps what we see happening nowadays, when there is a great deal of sudden death due to traffic accidents and the like comes under this heading.\nThirdly:\nWith regard to there being many earthquakes and a great deal of killing, it is soundly narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The Hour will not begin until knowledge is taken away, earthquakes increase, time passes quickly, tribulations appear, and there is a lot of haraj – which is killing, killing – and until there will be a lot of wealth among you and it will become abundant.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1036, and Muslim, 157)\nFourthly:\nWith regard to the Muslim only greeting those whom he knows\nIt was narrated from `Abdullah ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) that he narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that ahead of the Hour, people will only greet those whom they know and trade will become widespread, to the extent that a woman will help her husband in trade. There will be severing of ties of kinship, false testimony and concealment of true testimony, and literacy will become prevalent. (Narrated by Imam Ahmad in al-Musnad, 6/415-416. The commentators on al-Musnad classed it as sound)\nFifthly:\nWith regard to boasting of sins, we have not come across any hadith which mentions that. But it was narrated that `Abd ar-Rahman ibn Ghanm al-Ash`ari said: Abu `Amir or Abu Malik al-Ash`ari told me, and by Allah he did not lie to me, that he heard the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “There will surely be people among my ummah who will regard as permissible fornication, silk, alcohol and musical instruments. Some of them will surely stay near the side of a mountain, with their sheep grazing nearby, and a poor man will come and ask them for help, but they will say: Come back to us tomorrow. Then during the night Allah will destroy them and cause the mountain to fall on them, and he will transform others into monkeys and pigs [and they will remain like that] until the Day of Resurrection.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5590).\nWhat appears to be the case is that such boasting usually does not happen except when people regard the action as permissible and think that it is something good.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/334348/a-query-about-a-hadith-which-mentions-several-signs-of-the-approach-of-the-hour
67624,"I was wondering if it is possible to have warning dreams. I recently had a few dreams where someone is trying to harm one of my family members, physically and by slandering. Well, that’s what I get from the dream. I didn’t tell my family member the dream, but just to ask Allah for protection, because though others might plan against my family, I know Allah is the best of planners. Was I wrong for telling my family member that I fear others are trying to harm u, please make dua to Allah for protection? Insha Allah, I hope that I didn’t do anything wrong.","['Praise be to Allah.We ask Allah to protect us and you from all bad and evil things and to divert from us and from you the plots of the devils among mankind and the jinn, for He is the best of protectors and the Most merciful of those who show mercy.\nTypes of dreams in Islam\nWith regard to what the sleeper sees in his sleep, it falls into three categories:\n\ngood dreams which come from Allah;\nbad dreams which come from the devil;\nand what a person is thinking about.\n\nGood dreams in Islam\nGood dreams are those in which the sleeper sees good things; they come from Allah. They may be meant as good news, or warning against evil, or helping and guiding. It is Sunnah to praise Allah for them and to tell one’s loved ones, but not others, about them.\nBad dreams in Islam\nBad dreams are those in which the sleeper sees bad things; they come from the devil. It is Sunnah to seek refuge with Allah from them and to spit to the left three times, and not to talk about them, but if a person does that it will not harm him. It is also recommended to turn onto one`s other side, and to pray two Rak`ahs.\nConfused dreams in Islam\nIt may be that what one sees is not a dream of either of these two types, rather it stems from what one is thinking about. This is called confused dreams and it stems from events and fears stored in the memory and subconscious, which are replayed during sleep. For example, a man who works in a certain profession and spends all day working in that field, and before he goes to sleep he thinks about it, so he may see things having to do with it in his dream; or one who thinks about someone whom he loves and sees things that have to do with that person. There is no interpretation for these things.\nIt was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Towards the end of time, hardly any dream of a Muslim will be false. The ones who have the truest dreams will be those who are truest in speech. The dream of a Muslim is one of the forty-six parts of Prophethood. Dreams are of three types: a good dream which is glad tidings from Allah, a dream from the devil which causes distress, and a dream that comes from what a man is thinking of to himself…”\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“The meaning of the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), ‘The dreams of the believer are one of the forty-six parts of Prophethood’ is that the dreams of the believer come true, because they are like parables that the angel gives to the one who sees them. They may tell of something that is happening or that is going to happen, so it happens in accordance with the dream, so these dreams are like the way of Prophethood in that they come true, yet they are different from it. Hence they are one of the forty-six parts of Prophethood.” (End quote from Majmu` Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin, 1/327)\nThe dreams of the believer are described in the Hadiths as “true” and “good” and “from Allah”. What is meant by “true” is explained in the words of Ibn `Uthaymin quoted above as meaning that they come true. What is meant by “good” is that they bring good news or draw attention to some mistakes that one is not aware of. What is meant by their being “from Allah” is that they happen by His grace and mercy, or as a warning or glad tidings from Him, or as guidance from Him.\nBad dreams are described as “causing grief” or being “from the devil.” What is meant by “causing grief” is that they make one sad and cause distress. What is meant by them being “from the devil” is that they are instilled by him in an effort to cause fear or because of his toying with the sleeper.\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Alarm comes from the devil. The devil depicts to a person in his sleep things that alarm him with regard to himself, his wealth or his family, or in his community, because the devil loves to make the believers sad, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Secret counsels (conspiracies) are only from the devil, in order that he may cause grief to the believers. But he cannot harm them in the least, except as Allah permits.} [Al-Mujadilah 58:10]\nEverything that causes distress to people and upsets them, the devil is eager for it, whether it is when they are awake or asleep, because the devil is an enemy as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Surely, the devil is an enemy to you, so take (treat) him as an enemy.” [Fatir 35:6]” (End quote from Majmu` Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin, 1/329)\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught us what we should do if a person sees something in his dream that he dislikes and wakes up as a result. It is: spitting dryly to the left, seeking refuge with Allah from the devil, turning over, praying if one wants, and not telling people about it.\nWe should point out an important matter, which is that if a person is righteous and strives to obey Allah always, he will not be harmed if he sees or is seen (in a dream) in a situation that causes distress, but if he is an evildoer and sinner in his real life, then he will not benefit from seeing himself or being seen in the best state.\nIbn Muflih (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Hisham ibn Hassan said: Ibn Sirin was asked about one hundred dreams and he did not give any answer except to say: Fear Allah and do good whilst you are awake, and whatever you see in your sleep will not harm you.”\xa0 (End quote from Al-Adab Ash-Shar`iyyah, 3/451)\nAnd he (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Al-Marwadhi said: I brought Ibrahim Al-Humaydi with me to meet Abu `Abdullah, and he was a righteous man. He said: My mother saw [in a dream] that such and such happened to you, and she mentioned Paradise. He said: O my brother, the people used to say such things to Sahl ibn Salamah, and Sahl rebelled and shed blood, and he said: Dreams may bring joy to the believer but they cannot deceive him.” (End quote from Al-Adab Ash-Shar`iyyah, 3/453)\nAre there warning dreams from Allah?\nThere may be warnings in a dream to the person or to others, of some mistake that they are negligent about, or some sin that they are committing, or of a bad end if they continue as they are, following deviation or misguidance. These cannot be the bad dreams which come from the devil`s plots and efforts to cause grief, rather they come from Allah by His grace and mercy. So if a person sees something in his dream which indicates that he should alert and warn others, he should do so. The same applies if he sees something that warns and alerts him (i.e., he should pay heed).\nYou can warn your relative about a possible plot or evil that is expected, without mentioning who may be behind this plot. If you are worried that something bad may happen, then you should take precautions, and nothing will harm you in sha Allah, even if what you fear happens. But if what you feared did not happen, and the dream did not come true, no harm will befall you because you did not speak badly of anyone and did not transgress against anyone.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/67624/types-of-dreams-in-islam
