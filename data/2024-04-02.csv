294681,"This year, I led the worshippers in the Tarawih prayers, and as the last days of the blessed month approached, one of the brothers came to me and placed 200 dinars in my hand. I thought to myself: If it comes without coveting it, then take it. What is the ruling on taking this money and spending it? I know that you say there is no harm in taking a fee for leading the prayers, but what I want to know is: Does taking this money decrease the reward for leading the Tarawih prayers? The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said, ""Nothing of this world that a servant receives will decrease his rank with Allah, even if it is something valuable."" Does this Hadith apply to this case or not? And do you advise me to take this money and spend it, or should I give it in charity?","['Praise be to Allah.The ruling on an Imam receiving money for leading Tarawih prayers\nThere is no harm in the Imam accepting what is given to him, provided he does not fear obligation from the giver, and it does not decrease his reward.\nIbn Qudamah said in ""Al-Mughni"" (2/9): ""It has been narrated from him [i.e., Ahmad] that he said: \'Do not pray behind someone who does not pay Zakat, and he said: Do not pray behind someone who stipulates conditions, but there is no harm if they give to him without stipulation."" End quote.\nAl-Buhuti said in ""Kashshaf Al-Qina`"" (1/475): ""(If something is given to him) i.e., the Imam (without stipulation, then there is no harm, explicitly [i.e., Imam Ahmad stated this]). And likewise, if he is given from the public treasury or from a Waqf (endowment)."" End quote.\nThis is despite the fact that the Hanbalis prohibit taking a fee for leading prayers, but they do not consider a gift without stipulation as a fee.\nSheikh `Abdul `Aziz Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: ""What is the ruling on an Imam setting a fee for his prayers with the people, especially if he goes to distant areas to lead them in Tarawih?""\nHe replied: ""Setting a specific amount should not be done, and a group of the Salaf disliked it, so if they help (gift) him with something unspecified, there is no harm in that.\nAs for the prayer, it is valid, and there is no problem with it - In sha Allah - even if they set a specific amount to help him; because the need may call for that.\nHowever, it is preferable not to do that, and that the assistance be without stipulation, this is better and safer as stated by a group of the Salaf (may Allah have mercy on them)."" End quote.\nClarification of the Hadith: A servant does not acquire anything from this world except that it decreases his degrees with Allah...\nAs for the Hadith: ""A servant does not acquire anything from this world except that it decreases his degrees with Allah; even if it was given to him generously,"" the correct view is that it is from the saying of Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him). It is established from him, and it is not authentic from the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) as his saying. Al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) said in ""Sahih At-Targhib wat-Tarhib"": ""It was narrated by Ibn Abi Ad-Dunya, and its chain is good, and it was narrated from \'Aishah marfu`an (attributed to the Prophet), and the Mawquf (stopped at the Companion) is more authentic."" End quote.\nMoreover, this does not only apply to fees or gifts, but to all enjoyment of this world, and it is interpreted as referring to those who acquire from the world without right, or those who do not give thanks for what they have taken from it.\nIbn Al-Jawzi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n""The more a person ascends in this world, the more his rank decreases in the Hereafter. Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) explicitly stated this, saying: By Allah, no one acquires anything from this world except that it decreases his degrees with Allah, even if it was given to him generously.\nThe fortunate one is he who is content with sufficiency, for time is too noble to be wasted in pursuit of worldly gains, except for one who is pious in his earning, self-sufficient from greed, aiming to help the people of goodness, and giving charity to the needy, for the earning of such a person is better than his idleness.\nAs for the ascent that is caused by associating with rulers, it is unlikely that one\'s religion will remain safe with it, and even if it appears safe outwardly, the outcome is dangerous."" End quote from ""Sayd Al-Khatir"" (298).\nTaking a fee for acts of obedience that benefit others, such as teaching knowledge and the Quran, does not prevent the attainment of reward, and perhaps it does not decrease his reward, if his intention is good, his purpose is sincere, and he only takes it to be able to devote himself to benefiting and teaching. And his aim from this work is not merely worldly gain and accumulating wealth.\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: ""The essence of this matter is that it is recommended to take in order to perform Hajj, not to perform Hajj in order to take.\nThis applies to all provisions taken for a righteous deed; so whoever seeks provision to learn, to teach, or to strive in Jihad, then it is good. As it was reported from the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) that he said: The example of those who go out to fight from my Ummah and take their wages is like Umm Musa: she breastfeeds her son and takes her wage; he likened them to those who perform the act out of desire for it, like Umm Musa\'s desire to breastfeed; unlike a wet nurse who is hired for breastfeeding if she is a stranger.\nAs for those who engage in the appearance of a righteous deed in order to be provided for, this is from the actions of the world.\nThere is a difference between one whose goal is the religion, and the world is a means, and one whose goal is the world, and the religion is a means. And it is likely that such a person will have no share in the Hereafter, as indicated by texts that are not the subject here.""

And if you permit it, does the teacher still receive a reward from Allah after taking the monthly fee?\nThey replied: ""Learning and teaching the Quran is one of the best ways to draw closer to Allah, Exalted be He, if the intention is correct, and the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) encouraged learning and teaching the Quran by saying: \'The best among you are those who learn the Quran and teach it.\'\nTaking a fee by Quran teachers for teaching does not contradict the attainment of reward and merit from Allah, Exalted be He, if the intention is pure.\n`Abdul `Aziz ibn `Abdullah Ibn Baz... `Abdul `Aziz Al Al-Sheikh... `Abdullah ibn Ghudayan...

Different prophetic narrations state the great reward of walking to the mosque on foot. in addition to getting rewarded for attending congregational prayers, one could also get rewarded when he drives to the mosque.

It was said to him, or I said to him: If you bought a donkey to ride on in the dark and in the heat, he said: It would not please me that my house is next to the mosque, for I want my walk to the mosque and my return when I return to my family to be recorded for me. So the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: \'Allah has gathered all of that for you.\'\nAnd riding cannot be equated with walking; because walking involves more effort and work, and riding involves more comfort and ease, and the step of the servant is from his work, and the turning of the car\'s wheel is not from his effort, so they cannot be equated.\nPease see the answer to question number (70216 ).\nSecondly:\nThe mention of the house in the Hadith is used in the sense of what is most common, because most people usually head to the mosques for most of the prayers coming from their homes.\nSo it includes those who intend Salah from their place of work or their temporary residence and the like, because these are similar actions.\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n""It has been established in His, the Exalted, Shari`ah that the ruling of a thing is the ruling of its like, so His Shari`ah does not differentiate between two similar things ever, nor does it combine two opposites...

336566,Is salah invalid if we do not keep our back straight?,"['Praise be to Allah.Maintaining a straight back in Salah (formal prayer) is required in three positions:\nThe first position: (During standing) i.e., after the opening Takbir (Takbirat Al-Ihram).\nJurists have differed regarding the manner of standing. The Hanafis and Hanbalis say that one should stand in such a way that if they were to extend their hands, they would not reach their knees.\nIt is stated in ""Al-Jawharah An-Nayyirah"" (1/50): ""The limit of standing is such that if one extends their hands, they would not reach their knees.""

It is not permissible for one who is able to stand (straight) to lean\xa0to one side, deviating from the norms of standing, nor to stand bent as if in the position of those bowing; if the bending does not reach the extent of bowing but is closer to it, there are two views: the most correct of which is that their Salah is not valid because they are not standing straight. The second view is that it is valid because it is close to the required posture. If one lowers their head without bending, their Salah is valid without dispute because they are standing straight."" End quote. Also see: ""At-Taj wal-Iklil"" (1/419).\nTherefore, if the person praying bends and their bending is closer to bowing without an excuse, their Salah is invalidated according to the Malikis and Shafi`is.\nAccording to the Hanafis and Hanbalis, it is not invalidated unless it reaches the extent of bowing.\nThe second and third positions: (During straightening up) i.e., from bowing and prostration.\nThere is a Hadith from Abu Mas`ud Al-Badri, who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: ""A man\'s Salah is not valid until he straightens his back in bowing and prostration."" Reported by Abu Dawud (855), At-Tirmidhi (265) who said it is sound and authentic, An-Nasa’i (1027), and Ibn Majah (870).\nImam At-Tirmidhi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe practice of the scholars from among\xa0the Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) and those after them is upon this,\xa0as they believe that a man should straighten his spine in bowing and prostration.\nAsh-Shafi`i, Ahmad, and Ishaq said: Whoever does not straighten their spine in bowing and prostration, their Salah is invalid due to the Hadith of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him): ""A Salah is not valid if a man does not straighten his spine in bowing and prostration."" ""Sunan At-Tirmidhi"" (2/51).\nIt is also reported in ""Musnad Ahmad"" (10799) from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: ""Allah does not look at the Salah of a man who does not straighten his spine between his bowing and prostration.""\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in ""Majmu` Al-Fatawa"" (22/534):\n""This is explicit in that Salah is not valid until a man straightens up from bowing and stands straight from prostration; this indicates the obligation of straightening up in bowing and prostration...\nThat is because his statement (to straighten his back in bowing and prostration) means: when raising his head from them; for straightening the back is part of the completion of bowing and prostration; because when he bows, the bowing is from the moment he bends until he returns and straightens up, and prostration is from the moment of falling from standing or sitting until he returns and straightens up.\nThe lowering and raising are the ends and completion of bowing and prostration; therefore, he said: (to straighten his spine in bowing and prostration).""\nAnd this shows that the obligation of this straightening is like the obligation of completing bowing and prostration.""
