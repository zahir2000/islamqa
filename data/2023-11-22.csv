119722,"How sound is the nasheed that is attributed to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), “Tala‘a al-Badru ‘alayna”, and is it permissible to sing it?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe singing of this nasheed, of which the meanings are sound, is mentioned in the books of Sirah (the Prophet’s biography) and in some books of hadith. As for the report that refers to that, it is what was narrated by ‘Ubaydullah ibn Muhammad ibn ‘A’ishah (d. 228 AH – may Allah have mercy on him), who said:\nWhen the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came to Madinah, the women, boys and young girls started to sing:\n“Tala‘a al-badru ‘alayna, min thaniyyat al-wada‘\nWajaba ash-shukru ‘alayna, ma da‘a Lillahi da‘.\n(The full moon has risen upon us, from Thaniyyat al-Wada‘ (lit. the mountain pass of farewell).\nWe must give thanks, every time the caller calls to Allah).”\nThis was narrated by Abu’l-Hasan al-Khala‘i in al-Fawa’id (2/59), and al-Bayhaqi in Dala’il al-Nubuwwah (no. 752, 2019). In Fath al-Bari (7/261), al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar attributed it to Abu Sa‘id in Sharaf al-Mustafa. All of them narrated it via the great and trustworthy scholar of hadith Abu Khalifah al-Fadl ibn al-Habbab (d. 305). See his biography in Siyar A‘lam an-Nubala’ (14/7), narrated from Ibn ‘A’ishah.\nThis is a da‘if (weak) isnad, in which there is a large interruption. Ibn ‘A’ishah died late, and he was one of the shaykhs of Imam Ahmad and Abu Dawud, so how could he narrate an incident from the life of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) without an isnad?\nHence al-Hafiz al-‘Iraqi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is a problematic report.""(Takhrij al-Ihya’\xa0 1/571).\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is a problematic isnad.""(Fath al-Bari\xa0 2/262).\nShaykh al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This is a da‘if (weak) isnad. Its narrators are trustworthy, but it is problematic because three or more narrators are missing from its isnad. That is because this Ibn ‘A’ishah is one of the shaykhs of Ahmad, and he narrated it as a mursal report… So the whole story is not proven.""(As-Silsilah ad-Da‘ifah\xa0 2/63).\nThe great scholar Ibn al-Qayyim has explained the problem with the story which says that that happened when the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came from Makkah to Madinah, as he said: There is something clearly wrong with the story, because Thaniyyat al-Wada‘ is in the direction of Syria [that is, on the northern side of Madinah] and one who is coming from Makkah to Madinah will not see it or pass through it, unless he carries on towards Syria.""(Zad al-Ma‘ad\xa0 3/551).\nHence al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Perhaps that incident happened when he came back from the campaign to Tabook.(Fath al-Bari\xa0 7/262).\nBut this rejection of the story on this basis is not to be accepted, because it is well known to the narrators of this story that it happened when the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came from Makkah to Madinah, as Imam al-Bayhaqi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Our scholars mentioned this in the context of his arrival in Madinah from Makkah, and did not say that it happened when he came to Madinah through Thaniyyat al-Wada‘ on his return from Tabuk.""(Dala’il an-Nubuwwah).\nHowever, many historians have stated that Thaniyyat al-Wada‘ is in the direction of Makkah, and that there may have been a different thaniyyah, with the same name, in the direction of Syria.\nOthers stated that when the Prophet (blessings and place of Allah be upon him) entered Madinah, he passed by the houses of the Ansar, and even passed by Banu Sa‘idah, whose land was in the northern part of Madinah, near Thaniyyat al-Wada‘, so he did not enter the centre of Madinah except from that direction, until he reached the place where he halted.\nSee: Mu‘jam al-Buldan by Yaqut al-Hamawi (2/86); Tarh at-Tathrib by al-‘Iraqi (7/239-240); Subul al-Huda wa’r-Rashad by as-Salihi ash-Shami (3/277); and al-Athar al-Muqtafa li Qissat Hijrat al-Mustafa by Abu Turab az-Zahiri (p. 155-162).\nSecondly:\nThe weakness of the isnad of these lines of verse does not mean that it is not permissible to quote them, narrate the story, or sing them as a nasheed, because the meaning is sound and beautiful, and it is very famous among the Muslims. Nothing in the story is attributed to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), such that we should be strict about its isnad; rather these are the words of the Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them).\nMost of the scholars are of the view that we may be lenient and easy-going with regard to the reports of the Sirah, and stories and words of the Sahabah and Tabi‘in on which no issue of creed (‘aqidah) or rulings on halal and haram are based. It says in Sharh ‘Ilal at-Tirmidhi (1/327) by al-Hafiz Ibn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him): Sufyan ath-Thawri (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nKnowledge of what is halal and haram should only be taken from prominent figures who are well-known for their knowledge, for they know which reports are sound and which are less so. With regard to other matters, there is nothing wrong with learning them from other shaykhs.\nIbn Abi Hatim said: My father told us: ‘Abdah said:\nIt was said to Ibn al-Mubarak – when he narrated the report from a man – it was said that this man is not reliable. He said: It is fine to narrate such matters – or such things – from him.\nI said to ‘Abdah: Such as what things? He said: Matters such as manners and attitude, exhortation, or asceticism.\nIbn Ma‘in said, regarding Musa ibn ‘Uyaynah: You may accept of his reports that which could soften the heart.\nIbn ‘Uyaynah said: Do not accept reports from Baqiyah – the name of one of the reporters – that speak of Sunnah matters, but you may accept from him reports that speak of reward and so on.\nAhmad said regarding Ibn Ishaq: You may accept from him reports about military campaigns (maghazi) and the like.\nIbn Ma‘in said regarding Ziyad al-Baka’i: There is nothing wrong with accepting his reports about military campaigns, but not about anything else. End quote.\nUndoubtedly these lines of verse are among the matters in which it is most appropriate to be easy-going and lenient about narrating them.\nDr. Akram Diya’ al-‘Umari said:\nAs for stipulating conditions like those of hadith in order to verify historical reports that do not speak about matters of creed or halal and haram, that is too extreme and could lead to some serious problems, because the historical reports that were compiled by the historians among our earlier generations were not dealt with as hadiths were dealt with; rather they were lenient regarding them. If we reject their approach, then the gaps in our history would form a huge vacuum, which would lead to confusion, loss, troubles and alienation. But that does not mean that we should abandon the methods of the hadith scholars when critiquing the isnads of historical reports, for those methods are a means of finding out which of two contradictory reports is more likely to be sound. They are also the best help in deciding to accept or reject some reports that are very problematic, or odd reports that do not fit the general framework of our ummah’s history. But we should be flexible when referring to the standards, taking into consideration the fact that reports from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) are different from historical reports, and that the former were given a great deal of care and attention that enabled the scholars to prove them to be good when measured against very strict standards.(Dirasat Tarikhiyyah\xa0 p. 27).\nIn conclusion, there is nothing wrong with singing these lines of verse, enjoying them, memorising them and teaching them to children, even if they are not proven via sound (sahih) isnads. That is because, when it comes to events such as this, it is sufficient that reports of them are circulated and are very well known among knowledgeable people. Moreover there is nothing in the story to attribute these lines of verse to any particular individual among the Sahabah; rather they are attributed to the women, boys and young girls, which makes the matter more flexible.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/119722/the-nasheed-talaa-al-badru-alayna
131590,There is a man upon whom Allah has bestowed the blessing of wealth. How should he handle it? How should he put this wealth to work? How can he protect it and increase it without incurring the wrath of Allah?,"['Praise be to Allah.What Islam teaches about wealth\nWealth may be a blessing if it is used for purposes that are pleasing to Allah, and to help one obey Allah. It may be a calamity if it is used for evil purposes, or if it makes one proud and arrogant, or it distracts him from obeying and remembering Allah.\nHence there are warnings about the temptation of wealth, because it usually causes one to transgress and forget (the Bestower), and there are few who fulfill the rights due to Allah, may He be Exalted, concerning wealth.\xa0\nAllah, may He be Exalted, says, explaining that tests may come in the form of good things and blessings, just as they may come in the form of bad things and calamities (interpretation of the meaning):\n“and We shall make a trial of you with evil and with good, and to Us you will be returned”\xa0[Al-Anbiya’ 21:35]\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “By Allah, it is not poverty that I fear for you, rather what I fear for you is that worldly riches may be given to you as it was given to those who came before you, and you will compete to attain (more of) it with one another as those before competed with one another, and you will be destroyed as they were destroyed.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 4015, and Muslim, 2961)\nMuslim (2742) narrated from Abu Sa‘id Al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “This world is sweet and green, and Allah will make you successive generations therein, so beware how you act. Be at your guard regarding this world and be at your guard regarding women, for the first trial among the Children of Israel had to do with women.”\nWhoever, Allah, may He be Exalted, enables to earn wealth from permissible sources, and spends it in appropriate ways, and strives to use it in doing acts of obedience and acts that bring one closer to Allah, then in his case wealth is a blessing, and he deserves to be envied for it (in a good way), as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “How good lawful wealth is for a righteous man.” (Narrated by Ahmad (17096); classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Saheeh Al-Adab Al-Mufrad (299)\nHe (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) also said: “There is no cause for envy except in two cases: a man to whom Allah gives wealth and enables him to spend it in support of the truth, and a man to whom Allah gives knowledge and he rules based on it and teaches it.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhaari, 73, and Muslim, 816)\nHow should money be spent in Islam?\nThe ways of spending wealth in a good manner are many and include: building mosques , giving charity , sponsoring orphans , and helping the sick and needy.\xa0\nThey also include bringing happiness to one’s family, children and relatives; using it to perform Hajj and `Umrah repeatedly; establishing schools for teaching Quran memorisation and teaching knowledge; giving loans to the needy; allowing more time for debtors who are in difficulty to pay off their debts; contributing to charitable projects that will benefit the Muslims, such as constructive satellite channels, beneficial websites, and other ways of doing good, the number of which no one knows except Allah.\nWhat matters is that the donor should understand that his real wealth is that which he gives for the sake of Allah, because he will find its good consequences after he dies.\xa0\nAs for the wealth that he keeps, it is not his wealth in the true sense of the word; rather it is the wealth of his heirs. This meaning is what was narrated by Al-Bukhari (6442) from ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ood (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “For which of you is the wealth of his heir dearer to him than his own wealth?” They said: O Messenger of Allah, there is no one among us but his wealth is dearer to him. He said: “Verily his (real) wealth is that which he sends on ahead, and the wealth of his heir is that which he keeps back.”\nHow to increase your wealth in Islam\nWith regard to ways of making one’s wealth work and grow , this is a matter concerning which one should consult specialists, but we can give you some general guidelines concerning that, which include the following:\xa0\n\nAsking and enquiring about the permissibility of the transaction or investment method before starting it.\nAvoiding putting one’s wealth in Riba-based banks and not being deceived by those who issue Fatwas stating that doing so is permissible, because Riba is one of the causes of divine wrath and loss of blessings , and the one who engages in it is in a state of war with Allah and His Messenger.\nAvoiding dubious matters.\nUnderstanding the danger that ill-gotten wealth poses to oneself, one’s family and one’s offspring.\nBeing prudent and careful, and not being deceived by schemes that claim to bring quick profits, without studying and examining them.\nBeing careful to avoid wasting this blessing by entrusting it to those who should not be trusted with it.\nLooking for honesty, trustworthiness and transparency, and avoiding deceit and secrecy.\xa0\n\nThese are among the means of attaining blessing , making a profit and earning reward, as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If they [the two parties to a transaction] are honest and disclose any defects, their transaction will be blessed, but if they lie and conceal defects, the blessing of their transaction will be erased.” \xa0(Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 2097, and Muslim, 1532)\nWe ask Allah to bless your wealth, and to enable you to make it grow and use it in ways that please Him.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/131590/wealth-in-islam

My question is: do I share the burden of sin if these neighbours use the Internet for things that incur the wrath of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted? What is the solution?","['Praise be to Allah.The Internet is a means that may be used for good or evil, what is permissible and what is prohibited. If those who use it are not religiously committed people who adhere to the limits set by their Lord, then their usage may not be free from haram activities such as downloading images, music and movies, and participating in immoral chats, and the like. Therefore it is not permissible to give an Internet connection to anyone who you think most likely will use it for haram purposes. You should choose those of your neighbours who you think will never use it for haram purposes. Otherwise, you should keep your connection to yourself, even if it costs you more, so as to avoid helping anyone in sin.\nYou can also get a connection from an existing group that is already sharing the Internet connection, then you will be free of the issue of helping others in what is haram and telling them about it.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/112708/he-shared-his-internet-connection-with-his-neighbours-despite-the-possibility-that-they-may-use-it-for-sinful-purposes
161629,"Please could you tell me the basic guideline on marriage in Islam with regard to relatives? I know that it is permissible for a person to marry paternal cousins, but what is the ruling on marrying one’s father’s paternal cousin? And what is the ruling on my daughter marrying the nephew of my mother-in-law? Please advise me, may Allah reward you with good.","['Praise be to Allah.Allah, may He be Exalted, has mentioned women who are forbidden in marriage because of kinship. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Forbidden to you (for marriage) are: your mothers, your daughters, your sisters, your father\'s sisters, your mother\'s sisters, your brother\'s daughters, your sister\'s daughters…”\xa0[An-Nisa’ 4:23]\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\nThese are seven who are forbidden in marriage, according to the text and scholarly consensus; none of the scholars differed concerning this."" (Al-Sharh Al-Mumti`, 12/53)\nThey are:\xa0\n\nThe mother, which includes grandmothers on both the father’s and mother’s side\nThe daughter, which includes granddaughters\nSisters , whether full sisters or half-sisters through the father or mother\nThe paternal aunt, which also includes the paternal aunt of the father or mother\nThe maternal aunt , which also includes the maternal aunt of the father or mother\nThe brother’s daughter, which includes his granddaughters\nThe sister’s daughter, which includes her granddaughters\n\nAny other women who are relatives, apart from these, are permissible for marriage. Hence Allah, may He be Exalted, says in the following verse (interpretation of the meaning): “All others are lawful…”\xa0 [An-Nisa’ 4:24]\xa0\nBased on that, the daughter of one’s paternal uncle or aunt, or of one’s maternal uncle or aunt, are permissible in marriage. The Quran states that in the verse (interpretation of the meaning):\n“O Prophet (Muhammad )! Verily, We have made lawful to you your wives, to whom you have paid their Mahr (bridal money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage), and those (slaves) whom your right hand possesses - whom Allah has given to you, and the daughters of your paternal uncles and the daughters of your paternal aunts and the daughters of your maternal uncles and the daughters of your maternal aunts…”\xa0[Al-Ahzab 33:50]\xa0\nBased on this, it is permissible for a girl to marry her father’s paternal cousin , because a person’s paternal uncle is an uncle to him and to all his offspring. So her father’s paternal uncle is also an uncle to her, and his son is her cousin, and it is permissible for a girl to marry her paternal cousin.\xa0\nit is also permissible for your daughter to marry the son of your mother-in-law’s brother, because the brother of your mother-in-law is her maternal uncle, because he is the maternal uncle of her father, and the maternal uncle of one’s father is also an uncle to his children. And it is permissible for a girl to marry her maternal cousin.\xa0\nFor more details, please see this category: Women Who are Forbidden for Marriage\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/161629/women-forbidden-for-marriage-in-islam-due-to-kinship
