133585,"If the imam gets up after completing the prayer and before saying the salaam to do an extra rak‘ah, and those who are praying behind him realise that and alert him by saying “Subhan Allah,” yet despite that he insists on getting up for the extra rak‘ah, what is the ruling on that? What should those who are praying behind him do after he gets up?","['Praise be to Allah.What is required of the congregation is to alert the imam. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever notices something amiss during the prayer, let the men say ‘Subhan Allah’ and let the women clap.” And what is required of the imam, if they alert him, is to go back, unless he believes that he is right and they are wrong. In that case, he should do what he himself believes is right and continue until he completes the prayer, according to what he believes is the case. If those who alerted him are certain that he is wrong and is making a mistake, they should not get up with him; rather they should remain seated, reciting at-tahiyyat, sending blessings on the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and offering supplication, waiting for him until they say the salaam with him. That is because he is excused and they are excused; they are excused because they believed that he was making a mistake, and he is excused because he believed that he was right and they were mistaken. Hence each of them is excused because of his ijtihad and being certain, as each of them thinks he was right. Then when the imam says the salaam, they should say the salaam with him.\nBut if the imam is not certain, then what he must do is go back, if two or more people alerted him. In that case, if he is not certain and only thought that he was right, he should go back. He should go back as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did on the day when Dhu’l-Yadayn alerted him [to a mistake in the prayer]. He asked the people, and they said that Dhu’l-Yadayn was right, so the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) went back and completed the prayer. He did not act immediately on what Dhu’l-Yadayn said, because he was one person, and it is not obligatory to accept the view of one person in this regard, unless the imam believes that he is right, in which case he should go back. But if two people alert him, then he should accept what they say and act on it, and ignore what he thinks is the case; that is obligatory. As for the people praying behind the imam, they should not follow him if he makes a mistake by adding or omitting something. If he is adding a rak‘ah, they should sit and wait until he says the salaam, then say the salaam with him. If he has omitted a rak‘ah and did not pay attention to them, and he sits in the third rak‘ah of Zuhr, for example, or of ‘Isha’ or ‘Asr, or he sits in the first rak‘ah of Fajr or Jumu‘ah, and does not pay any heed to them, then they should stand up and complete their prayer, and differ from him, because they believe that he is making a mistake.

326674,"We are a family of nine children; all of us are married and have families. Our father is deceased, and we have an elderly mother. We take turns in looking after her, and one of her children serves or helps her every day. One of our sisters has excused herself from taking care of our mother on the grounds that this is the responsibility of the sons, not of the daughters, because the woman’s duties towards her husband and children take precedence over her duties towards her parents, as stated in Islamic teachings, and a scholar has given her a Fatwa to that effect, as she claims.","[""Praise be to Allah.If the parents need to be looked after, it is obligatory for all their children, whether male or female, to help them, either by doing this themselves or by hiring someone to do it.\nAs-Safarini (may Allah have mercy on him) said in\xa0Ghidha’ Al-Albab\xa0(1/390): “Parents’ rights also include: serving or helping them if both of them, or one of them, needs that.”\nIn\xa0Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah\xa0(19/39) it says:\xa0\n“With regard to the child serving or helping his or her parent, or the parent asking his or her child to help him or her, that is permissible and there is no difference of scholarly opinion concerning that. In fact, this comes under the heading of honouring one's parents that is enjoined in Islamic teachings, and it is obligatory for the child to take care of his or her parent, or to hire someone to do that, when needed. Hence it is not permissible for the child to charge a fee for doing that, because it is duty that is required of him or her, and in the case of one who does a duty that is required of him or her towards someone else, it is not permissible to charge a fee for this.”\xa0\nTherefore, this service and help is obligatory for all of you, but if a woman's husband prevents her from serving and helping her mother , then the husband's right takes precedence , and she can make up for that by hiring a servant or by contributing to wages for a servant, if she has money. But if her husband does not prevent her from doing that, then serving and helping her mother is obligatory for her as it is for her siblings.\nIt is not appropriate for the husband, if he is a man of decency and dignity, to prevent his wife from doing that , especially if she is only going to help her mother one or two days a week.\nMoreover, if the mother needs a woman to take care of her, then the most appropriate people to do that are her daughters, because it is more appropriate for them to undertake that than anyone else, especially if it is not possible to hire a woman to do that, or if the mother does not like strangers (nonfamily members) to see any of her private affairs.\nSo you should advise your sister and explain to her the importance of honouring her mother, and the seriousness of defiant disobedience to her mother, and tell her that it is more appropriate for the daughter to take care of her mother than the son, because taking care of an elderly person may require seeing the `Awrah, and for a woman's daughter to see her `Awrah is less serious than her son seeing it.\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/326674/whose-responsibility-is-it-to-look-after-parents-in-islam
426969,"I got a job a month ago, and I used to use sunblock because of my work situation, and when the time for prayer came, I would do wudu and pray. Then I read that sunblock may prevent water from reaching the skin when doing wudu, and most of the time I was using sunblock. My question is: what must I do now? Do I have to repeat my prayers? Please note that it is very difficult for me to work out the number of prayers I must make up, except the prayers of today only, because I am certain that I put on sunblock today when I did wudu?","['Praise be to Allah.It is obligatory to remove anything that may prevent water from reaching the skin, so that you will be able to wash the parts of the body in wudu as enjoined in the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{O you who have believed, when you rise to [perform] prayer, wash your faces and your forearms to the elbows and wipe over your heads and wash your feet to the ankles}\xa0[al-Ma’idah 5:6].\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him): “If you find water and make it touch your skin, that is good.” Narrated by Abu Dawud (332); classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud.\nWhat prevents water from reaching the skin is that which has a substance and thickness, and does not dissolve in water.\nAs for that which has no substance, and only leaves its colour or a greasy trace, like olive oil and the like, there is no need to remove it.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Majmu‘ (1/456): If there is some wax, dough, henna or the like on one of his limbs, and it prevents water from reaching any part of that limb, then his wudu is not valid, whether it is on most of the limb or only on a small area. If what remains on his hand or other limb is a trace and the colour of henna, not its substance, or a trace of liquid grease, such that water still touches the skin of that limb and runs over it, but does not remain there, then his wudu is valid. End quote.\nIbn Shata al-Bakri (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nTraces of ink and henna do not matter. What is meant by traces is mere colour, such that if you scratch it, for example, nothing comes off.""(I‘anat at-Talibin\xa01/35).\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: If there is a layer of a greasy substance, specifically Vaseline, does it prevent the water from reaching the skin? What must a person do if he did wudu and prayed many prayers with this, when it was still on his hand, without him realising that the grease prevents water from reaching the skin? How can he get rid of this greasy substance?\nHe replied: Lotions that have no substance do not prevent water from reaching the skin, whether they come in the form of oil or grease or some other type of lotion that has no substance. They do not prevent water from reaching the skin.\nBut if it is something that has substance and leaves a trace that prevents water from reaching the skin, then you should remove it; whether it is on your hand, your face or your foot, you should remove it. If you rub your hand or face or foot with something that has no substance and nothing is left of it – rather it only leaves a trace of which you feel some sensation and the like – this does not prevent the water from reaching the skin and there is nothing wrong with that. That which prevents water from reaching the skin is that which has substance that forms a barrier between the water and the skin.""(Fatawa Ibn Baz\xa0 5/245).\nBased on that, if the sunblock has substance and does not dissolve in water, then wudu and ghusl done with it on the skin are not valid, and you must repeat the prayers that you offered after you did wudu having put sunblock on your skin.\nYou should try to work out the number of these prayers, and try to err on the side of caution so as to absolve yourself.\nBut if the sunblock did not have any substance, or it had substance but it dissolved when water touched the skin, then it does not matter if you were wearing it.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/426969/he-used-to-put-sunblock-on-his-face-and-do-wudu
11035,"The Quran says (what means) ""Angels and Gabriel ascend to Allah in a day equivalent to 5000 terrestrial years.” Does this imply that Allah is controlling the earthly matters sitting on the Throne? Then how can it be that Allah is nearer to us than the veins?","['Praise be to Allah.Is Allah above the Throne?\nIt is proven in the Quran and Sunnah (prophetic teachings) and by the consensus of the Salaf (early generations) of this Ummah (global Islamic nation) that Allah is above His heavens over His Throne (as befits His Majesty), and that He is the Exalted, Most High. He is above all things, and there is nothing that is above Him. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \xa0\n{Allah, it is He Who has created the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them in six days. Then He\xa0rose over (istawa) the Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty). You (mankind) have none, besides Him, as a Wali (protector or helper) or an intercessor. Will you not then remember (or receive admonition)?} [As-Sajdah 32:4] \xa0\n{Surely, your Lord is Allah Who created the heavens and the earth in six days and then rose over (istawa) the Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty), disposing the affair of all things.} [Yunus 10:3]\n\xa0{To Him ascend (all) the goodly words, and the righteous deeds exalt it (i.e. the goodly words are not accepted by Allah unless and until they are followed by good deeds).} [Fatir 35:10]\n\xa0“He is the First (nothing is before Him) and the Last (nothing is after Him), the Most High (nothing is above Him) and the Most Near (nothing is nearer than Him).} [Al-Hadid 57:3]\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “You are the Most High and there is nothing above You…”\nThere are many similar verses and prophetic narrations. But at the same time, Allah tells us that He is with His slaves wherever they are:\n{Have you not seen that Allah knows whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on the earth? There is no najwa (secret counsel) of three but He is their fourth (with His Knowledge, while He Himself is over the Throne, over the seventh heaven), — nor of five but He is their sixth (with His Knowledge), — nor of less than that or more but He is with them (with His Knowledge) wheresoever they may be.} [Al-Mujadalah 58:7]\nAllah has combined mention of His being above His Throne with mention of His being with His slaves in one ayah (verse), where He says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n{He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six days and then rose over (istawa) the Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty) . He knows what goes into the earth and what comes forth from it, and what descends from the heaven and what ascends thereto. And He is with you (by His Knowledge) wheresoever you may be.} [Al-Hadid 57:4] \xa0\nHow is Allah close to us?\nSaying that Allah is with us does not mean that He is mixed with (or dwells in) His creation; rather He is with His slaves by His knowledge. He is above His Throne and nothing is hidden from Him of what they do. With regard to the verse (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n{And We are nearer to him than his jugular vein (by Our Knowledge).} [Qaf 50:16]\xa0\nMost of the exegetists said that what is meant is that He is near by means of His angels whose task it is to record people’s deeds. And those who said that it means that He is near explained it as meaning that He is near by His knowledge, as is said concerning how He is with us.\nThis is the view of Ahl As-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah (followers of prophetic guidance), who affirm that Allah is above His creation and that He is also with His slaves, and they state that He is far above dwelling in His created beings.\xa0\nWith regard to the denial of all Divine attributes as voiced by the Jahmiyyah (a deviant sect) and their followers, they deny that His Essence is above His creatures and that He rose above His Throne, and they say that He is present in His Essence everywhere. We ask Allah to guide the Muslims.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11035/is-allah-above-the-throne
