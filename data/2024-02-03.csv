470760,What is the opinion on holding a second congregation in all the madhabs?,"['Praise be to Allah.Holding a second congregational prayer in the mosque may happen in various ways; in some cases the ruling is agreed upon, and in others there is a difference of opinion on the ruling.\n-1-\nWhen a number of congregational prayers are held because the people are divided into different groups, sects and madhhabs, so the mosque management organises more than one congregational prayer on a permanent basis, with each group having its own imam and its own time for prayer.\nThis is not allowed, according to scholarly consensus.\nIt says in Mawahib al-Jalil by al-Hattab (may Allah have mercy on him):\nAs for establishing one prayer with two regular imams, where they both attend, and the one whose turn it is to pray first goes ahead and leads the prayer, whilst the other group sits and waits with their imam until the first group has finished, then they give the iqaamah for their prayer. No one has suggested that this is allowed, and it is not possible that there could be a report from any of the jurists to suggest that he did it or approved of it.\nIt is even worse if two imams are leading prayers at the same time, each of them saying “Hayya ‘ala as-salah (come to prayer)” and saying takbir, when those praying behind them are mixed, each of them hearing the recitation of the other? These people will cause more friction, that was not known to the early generations or those who came after them. Moreover, it is going against the words of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “Do not disturb one another with your recitation of Quran…”""(Mawahib al-Jalil\xa0 2/380).\n-2-\nWhen there is a second congregational prayer in a mosque in which there is no regular imam, as happens in some mosques that are on travel routes. In this case, it is permissible for there to be a number of congregational prayers, according to scholarly consensus.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: With regard to the views of the scholars regarding congregational prayer in a mosque where a congregational prayer has already been offered:\nIf there is no regular imam, then it is not disliked (makruh) for there to be a second, third or more congregational prayer, according to scholarly consensus.""(Al-Majmu‘\xa0 4/222).\n-3-\nHolding a second congregational prayer for some reason, in a mosque where there is a regular imam.\nThe majority of Hanafi, Maliki and Shafa‘i scholars are of the view that it is disliked (makruh) to hold a second congregational prayer in this case.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If there is a regular imam, and the mosque is not frequented, then in our view it is disliked (makruh) to hold a second congregational prayer without the permission of the imam. This is the view of ‘Uthman al-Batti, al-Awza‘i, Malik, al-Layth, ath-Thawri and Abu Hanifah.\nAhmad, Ishaq, Dawud and Ibn al-Mundhir said that it is not disliked (makruh).""(Al-Majmu‘\xa0 4/222).\nImam Abu Bakr ibn al-Mundhir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nChapter: The concession allowing prayer in congregation in a mosque in which the imam has already led the people in prayer.\nAbu Bakr said:\nWe have narrated that a man entered the mosque when the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) had already prayed, and he said: “Will anyone be charitable towards this man and pray with him?”\nThere was a difference of scholarly opinion regarding that.\nIt is proven from Anas that he led a congregational prayer after the imam had already prayed. It was also narrated from Ibn Mas‘ud that he did the same thing. This was the view of ‘Ata’, an-Nakha‘i, al-Hasan al-Basri, Qatadah, Ahmad and Ishaq. Ahmad quoted as evidence the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “Prayer in congregation is twenty-seven times better than prayer offered individually.”\nSome said: A congregational prayer should not be offered in the mosque twice. This is the view of Salim ibn ‘Abdillah, and also of Abu Qilabah, Ibn ‘Awn, Ayyub, ‘Uthman al-Batti, Malik, al-Layth ibn Sa‘d, Sufyan ath-Thawri, al-Awza‘i, ash-Shafa‘i, and ashab ar-ra’y.\nAbu Bakr ibn al-Mundhir said: I favour the first view.""(Al-Ishraf ‘ala Madhahib al-‘Ulama’\xa0 2/146-147).\nThis view which was favoured by Ibn al-Mundhir is the correct view, because of the evidence from the Sunnah to that effect.\nIbn al-Mundhir (may Allah have mercy on him) said elsewhere:\nIt is proven that the Prophet of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Prayer in congregation is twenty-seven times better than prayer offered individually.” And it is proven that he said: “For a man to pray with another man is more appropriate than his praying on his own, and for a man to pray with three others is more appropriate; the more people there are, the more beloved it is to Allah.”\nAnd the hadith of Abu Sa‘id [according to which a man came when the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) had already prayed, so he said: “Will anyone be charitable towards this man and pray with him?”] is proven.\nSo if some people miss the prayer with the imam, they may pray together in congregation, following the hadith of Abu Sa‘id, and seeking the virtue of praying in congregation. We do not know of any evidence for those who dislike and disallow that.""(Al-Awsat\xa0 4/248).\nSee also the answer to question no. 87847, in which there is a fatwa from Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin regarding this matter.\nBut to give a complete picture of this matter, we should mention the views of all the madhhabs.\nBadr ad-Deen al-‘Ayni al-Hanafi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIn our view, it is disliked (makruh) for the prayer in congregation to be repeated in the same mosque.""(Al-Binayah\xa0 2/580).\nYahya ibn Yahya al-Laythi said:\nMalik was asked about a mu’adhdhin who gives the call to prayer, then he waits to see whether anyone else will come, then no one comes, so he gives the iqamah (call immediately preceding the prayer) and prays by himself, then some people come after he has finished. Should he repeat the prayer with them? He said: He should not repeat the prayer. Whoever comes after he has finished praying, let him pray by himself.""(Muwatta’ Malik, narrated by Yahya\xa0 1/72).\nAsh-Shafa‘i (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf the mosque has a regular imam, and one or more men missed the prayer in the mosque, they should pray individually. I do not like them to pray in congregation, but if they do that, it is valid. However, I dislike them to do that, because that is not what the earlier generations did before us, and in fact some of them criticised that action.""(Al-Umm\xa02/292).\nPlease see also the answers to questions no. 87847 , 127293 and 146916 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/470760/what-is-the-ruling-on-doing-a-second-congregational-prayer-in-the-mosque-according-to-the-four-madhhabs
145520,"I hope that you can clarify this topic for me in some detail: Are “Hadith” and “Sunnah” synonymous, or is there a difference between them?","[""Praise be to Allah.The difference in terminology among scholars is one of the issues that is usually a difference in wording. That is because terminology results from a scholar choosing a particular word to refer to something; hence when differences occur, the difference is in wording but not in meaning.\xa0\nDifference between Hadith and Sunnah\nWith regard to the issue of differentiating between the words “Sunnah ” and “Hadith”, we may say that these two words may mean the same thing in some contexts, and may mean different things in other contexts.\xa0\nPlaces where Hadith and Sunnah mean the same thing\xa0\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Whatever is narrated from or about the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) of words, actions or approval may be called “Hadith” or it may be called “Sunnah .”\xa0\nShaykh `Abdullah al-Judayyi` said:\xa0\n“The basic meaning of the word “Sunnah” is fundamentally the same as the definition given by Hadith scholars, as mentioned above for the word “Hadith”, when mentioned in general terms without anything to describe what is being spoken of. That excludes the reports that speak of the physical description of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him); but this exclusion is only when talking about the Sunnah in the context of it being one of the sources of Shari`ah. In that context, the reports that speak of his description are not part of the Sunnah; rather the Sunnah is only based on his words, deeds and approval.” (Tahrir `Ulum Al-Hadith)\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 One of the names of the saved group, the group that will continue to adhere to the commands of Allah, is “Ahl Al-Hadith .” They are also called “Ahl As-Sunnah .”\xa0\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The books that deal with the transmission of reports from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and the Companions, and the words of the righteous early generations, are called “Kutub Al-Hadith ”; they are also called “Kutub As-Sunnah.”\xa0\nPlaces where Hadith and Sunnah mean different things\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The term Sunnah is applied to the Prophet's (may the peace and blessings of Allah be on him) guidance which is well-established in a general sense in all of his affairs, meaning his path, his methodology and his way. In this context, scholars do not usually use the term “Hadith .” \xa0\nAl-`Allamah As-Sayyid Sulayman An-Nadwi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n““Hadith” refers to every incident that is attributed to the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him), even if he only did it once in his life, and even if it was narrated from him by only one person. With regard to the word “Sunnah,” in reality it is used for his actions – I mean how the Messenger (peace and blessings be upon him) did things – that has been transmitted to us via mutawatir actions, in the sense that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) did it, then the Companions did it after him, then the Successors did it after them, and so on. It does not necessarily mean that there is a narration describing that action; rather this refers to the way in which a particular act was performed and was passed down through the generations by means of tawatur (i.e., passed down by so many to so many that it is inconceivable that they could have all agreed upon a lie).\xa0 This is what is called “Sunnah,” and this is mentioned alongside the Book (the Quran) in the Hadith in which the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: “I am leaving among you two things and you will never go astray so long as you adhere to them: The Book of Allah, may He be exalted, and the Sunnah of His Messenger.” This is what it is not permissible for any Muslim, no matter who he is, to forsake or go against, otherwise he has no share in Islam.” (Majallat Al-Manar, 30/673)\xa0\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The scholars use the word “Sunnah” to describe adhering to Islam in the manner prescribed, without adding to it or introducing innovations into the religion; they do not call that “Hadith.” For example, `Abd Ar-Rahman ibn Mahdi Al-Mashhur said: Sufyan Ath-Thawri is an imam (leading scholar) in Hadith, but he is not an imam in Sunnah; al-Awza`i is an imam in Sunnah but he is not an imam in Hadith. Maik ibn Anas is an imam in both. (Tarikh Dimashq by Ibn `Asakir, 35/183)\xa0\nAl-Hafiz Abu `Amr ibn As-Salah (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\xa0\nSome of them said of Imam Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) that he combined knowledge of the Sunnah and of Hadith; what is the difference between the Sunnah and Hadith?\xa0\nHe (may Allah be pleased with him) said:\xa0\n“In this context, Sunnah is the opposite of bid`ah (innovation). A person may be a scholar of Hadith yet also be an innovator. Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) combined both Sunnahs; he was a scholar of the Sunnah, i.e., Hadith, and also believed in the Sunnah, i.e., his way was that of Ahl al-haqq (the people of truth), with no bid `ah (innovation). And Allah knows best.” (Fatawa ibn As-Salah, 1/139-140)\xa0\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The jurists use the word “Sunnah” when explaining the ruling on doing a specific action as being mustahabb (liked or encouraged); they do not use the word “Hadith” in this context.\xa0\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 When the scholars speak of reports and whether they are authentic or weak , they only use the word “Hadith”; they do not use the word “Sunnah.” So they say “This is a weak Hadith”; they do not say “This is a weak Sunnah”, because of them the Sunnah is that which is proven in the Hadiths; therefore they sometimes say “This Hadith is contrary to analogy, the Sunnah and scholarly consensus.”\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/145520/difference-between-hadith-and-sunnah
467899,"My friend asked me for a favour to carry her luggage abroad, and I agreed. At the airport, I realized the weight limit has exceeded (due to misreading my ticket) and had to leave some items behind. In rush and illness, I forgot 3 items at the airport while sending back excess baggage. Unaware of this loss, I travelled and delivered the rest of her belongings, approximately 11-12 kgs of goods, to her.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIf someone is asked to transport some luggage and the like, this luggage is regarded as a trust under his care, and he is not liable for loss or damage unless he transgressed or was negligent, whether he is transporting it voluntarily or in return for payment. That is because in the case of one who is hired or appointed as a proxy, whatever is given to him to take care of is a trust (amanah).\nIt says in Sharh Muntaha al-Iradat (2/202): The proxy is in a position of trust. He is not liable if something is lost or damaged whilst in his care if he has not been negligent, because he is the proxy of the owner in possessing and disposing of it. So if it is destroyed when it is under his care, it is as if it was destroyed when under the care of its owner. This is like one who is given something for safekeeping, or the guardian of an orphan, and so on. It makes no difference whether he does that voluntarily or for payment; if he is negligent or transgresses, then he is liable. End quote.\nLeaving the excess baggage in the airport is regarded as negligence, and you should have contacted the owner of the items and worked out an arrangement to transfer those goods and pay excess baggage fees, or left them with someone honest, or told her to come and get them, and the like.\nBased on that, you are liable for these goods. If you can find a replacement for them, you must replace them, otherwise you are liable for their value on the day on which they were lost.\nSecondly:\nIf there was no agreement between you regarding payment for transporting the luggage, this means that you were doing it voluntarily, and you have no right now to demand payment.\nAnyone who carries luggage for someone else, or does work for him without a prior agreement on payment is doing it voluntarily, so he has no right to demand payment, unless that is his work which he does for a living, such as porters in the airport and the like. They are to be paid, even if there was no prior agreement.\nIt says in Kashshaf al-Qina‘ (4/206):\nWhoever does work for someone else without prior agreement on fees is not entitled to anything. That is because he offered his help without stipulating anything, so he is not entitled to any payment. That is so that no one will be obliged to pay anything that he did not commit to pay. This applies if the one who offered his help was not offering to do something that he does for a living. If he does do that for a living – such as sailors, porters, cuppers, fullers, tailors, real estate agents and so on, and such as those who measure and weigh things, and the like, who earn their living by doing these things – and the owner gives him permission to do that work, then he is entitled to the same wage as his peers, because that is what is customary.\nEnd quote.\nBased on that, you are not entitled to payment, because there was no prior agreement to that effect.\nYou should seek reward with Allah for what happened to you, for the reward with Allah for righteous deeds will not be lost.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/467899/is-the-person-who-was-entrusted-with-something-liable-if-he-leaves-it-in-the-airport-because-of-excess-weight
130499,"There was a discussion about the issue of putting one’s trust in Allah (tawakkul) and taking measures; the trust of some of the righteous is like that of Maryam, to whom summer fruits used to come in the winter and vice versa without her taking any measures; rather she focused completely on worship. Please advise us about that, may Allah bless you.","['Praise be to Allah.Shaykh `Abd Al-Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\nWhat is Tawakkul?\n“Putting one’s trust (Tawakkul) in Allah involves two things:\xa0\n\nDepending on Allah and believing that He is the One Who causes measures to be effective; His decree comes to pass; He has decreed all things, counted them out and ordained them, may He be glorified and exalted.\nTaking appropriate measures ; putting one’s trust in Allah does not mean refraining from taking measures ; rather part of putting one’s trust in Allah is taking appropriate measures and striving to do so. The one who refrains from doing so has gone against the laws and decree of Allah. Allah has commanded us to take appropriate measures and He encourages us to do so; He commanded His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to do that.\n\nIs it permissible to refrain from taking appropriate measures in Islam?\nSo it is not permissible for the believer to refrain from taking appropriate measures; in fact he is not truly putting his trust in Allah unless he takes appropriate measures. Hence it is prescribed to get married in order to have a child, and it is enjoined to have intercourse.\xa0\nIf someone were to say: I shall not get married and I shall wait to have a child without getting married, he would be regarded as insane; this is not the way of those who are wise and rational.\xa0\nSimilarly, he should not sit in his house or in the mosque seeking charity and waiting for provision to come to him; rather he should strive hard and work to seek to earn lawful provision.\xa0\nWhy did Allah tell Mary to shake a palm tree?\nMaryam (may Allah have mercy on her) did not forgo taking measures. Allah said to her (interpretation of the meaning): “And shake the trunk of the date-palm towards you, it will let fall fresh ripe-dates upon you.” [Maryam 19:25]\xa0\nSo she shook the palm tree and took appropriate measures until the dates fell. Her action is not contrary to taking measures and the fact that she found provision with her and that Allah honoured her and gave her some provision does not indicate that she refrained from taking appropriate measures; rather she devoted herself to worship and also took appropriate measures.\xa0\nIf Allah bestows upon some of His close friends some miracles (karamat), this is by His grace and bounty, but that does not indicate that we should forgo taking appropriate measures . It is proven that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Strive to do that which will benefit you and seek the help of Allah, and do not feel helpless.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2664)\nAnd Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help (for each and every thing).” [Al-Fatihah 1:5]\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/130499/what-is-tawakkul
