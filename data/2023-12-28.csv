Some people say that the wife`s relatives are not kindred.\xa0\nHe replied:\xa0\n“The kindred are the blood relatives on your mother`s and father`s sides.

Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And verily, We have sent among every Ummah (community, nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): ‘Worship Allah (Alone), and avoid (or keep away from) Taghut (all false deities besides Allah).’ Then of them were some whom Allah guided and of them were some upon whom the straying was justified.” [An-Nahl 16:36]\xa0\nThere are four heavenly books which Allah sent down. They are the Tawrat (Torah),\xa0Injil (Gospel ), Zabur (Psalms) and the Quran. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“It is He Who has sent down the Book (the Quran) to you (Muhammad) with truth, confirming what came before it. And He sent down the Tawrat (Torah) and the Injil (Gospel).”\xa0[Al `Imran 3:3] \xa0\nAllah also says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“and to Dawud (David) We gave the Zabur (Psalms)”\xa0[Al-Isra’ 17:55]\xa0\nNumber of the Messengers of Allah\nThe Prophets and Messengers were many, and no one knows their number except Allah. Among them are those of whom Allah has told us, and some of whom He has not told us. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And Messengers We have mentioned to you before, and Messengers We have not mentioned to you.” [An-Nisa’ 4:164]\xa0\nThe obligation to believe in the Books and Messengers of Allah\nIt is obligatory to believe in all the Books which Allah has revealed and in all the Prophets and Messengers whom Allah has sent, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“O you who believe! Believe in Allah, and His Messenger (Muhammad), and the Book (the Quran) which He has sent down to His Messenger, and the Scripture which He sent down to those before (him); and whosoever disbelieves in Allah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, and the Last Day, then indeed he has strayed far away.” [An-Nisa’ 4:136]\xa0\nDifference between Nabi and Rasool\nRasool (Messenger) and Nabi (Prophet) are two names with the same meaning. It refers to someone whom Allah sent to call the people to worship Allah alone, one of the Prophets and Messengers whom Allah chose and sent to His slaves to convey His religion. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\xa0\n“Messengers as bearers of good news as well as of warning in order that mankind should have no plea against Allah after the (coming of) Messengers.” [An-Nisa’ 4:165]\xa0\nNames of Messengers and Prophets mentioned in the Quran\nThe Prophets and Messengers are many , of whom Allah has mentioned twenty five in the Quran, and we are obliged to believe in all of them.

So judge among them by what Allah has revealed.” [Al-Ma’idah 5:48]\xa0\nWhat did the Messengers of Allah teach?\nAllah chose Messengers and Prophets from among the sons of Adam, and sent them to each nation, and commanded them to call them to worship Allah alone and to explain the ways which would bring happiness in this world and in the Hereafter, and to bring glad tidings of Paradise to those who believed and the warning of Hell to those who disbelieved. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\xa0\xa0\n“And verily, We have sent among every Ummah (community, nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): ‘Worship Allah (Alone), and avoid (or keep away from) Taghut (all false deities besides Allah).’ Then of them were some whom Allah guided and of them were some upon whom the straying was justified”[An-Nahl 16:36]\xa0\nAllah favoured some of the Prophets and Messengers over others. The best of them are the “Messengers of strong will” who are Nuh, Ibrahim, Musa, ‘Isa and Muhammad; and the best of the Messengers of strong will is Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). For each Prophet was sent only to his own people, until Allah sent Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to all of mankind. He is the last and the best of the Prophets and Messengers, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And We have not sent you (O Muhammad) except as a giver of glad tidings and a warner to all mankind, but most of men know not.” [Saba’ 34:28 – interpretation of the meaning]\xa0\nThe obligation to follow the example of the Messengers of Allah\nThe Prophets and Messengers were chosen by Allah to be an example to their nations. He taught them, guided them and honoured them with the Message; He protected them from falling into sin and supported them with miracles. So they are the most perfect of humanity both physically and in their attitude, the best of them in knowledge, the most truthful in speech, the most exemplary in the life they lived. Allah says of them (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And We made them leaders, guiding (mankind) by Our Command, and We revealed to them the doing of good deeds, performing Prayer, and the giving of Zakah and of Us (Alone) they were the worshippers.” [Al-Anbiya’ 21:73]\xa0\nBecause the Prophets and Messengers reached such a high status of obedience and good character , Allah has commanded us to take them as an example. Allah says ((interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“They are those whom Allah had guided. So follow their guidance.” [Al-An`am 6:90]\xa0\nAll of the characteristics of the Prophets and Messengers were combined in our Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and Allah honoured him by instilling in him the noblest characteristics.

178136,"If the Muslims celebrate the birthday of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), why do they not celebrate the birthday of the Prophet of Allah, Jesus (peace be upon him)? Is he not a Prophet who was sent from Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted?","['Praise be to Allah.Do Muslims believe in Jesus?\nBelieving in Jesus (peace be upon him) as a Prophet and Messenger who was sent by Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, to the Children of Israel is part of believing in Allah and His Messengers.

Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“The Messenger (Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) believes in what has been sent down to him from his Lord, and (so do) the believers. Each one believes in Allah, His Angels, His Books, and His Messengers. They say, `We make no distinction between one another of His Messengers’” [Al-Baqarah 2:285]\xa0\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“The believers believe that Allah is One, unique and Self-Sufficient; there is no god but He and no Lord other than Him. And they believe in all of the Prophets and Messengers, and the Books that were sent down from heaven to the slaves of Allah, the Messengers and Prophets. They do not differentiate between any of them, believing in some and disbelieving in others; rather in their view they are all truthful, righteous, rightly guided, and they guided people to the ways of goodness.” (Tafsir Ibn Kathir (1/736)\nAs-Sa`di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Disbelieving in some of them is disbelieving in all of them; in fact it is disbelieving in Allah.” (Tafsir As-Sa`di, p. 120)\nIs it permissible to celebrate Prophet Muhammad’s birthday?\nCelebrating the Mawlid or birthday of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is an innovation (Bid`ah). This was not done by the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) or by any of his Companions after him, and it is not known from any of the Imams (leading scholars) of the Muslims that he regarded it as permissible or recommended, let alone participated in it. All of that comes under the heading of prohibited things and reprehensible innovations.\xa0\nThe scholars of the Standing Committee said:\xa0\n“Celebrating the occasion of the Prophet’s birthday is a prohibited innovation, because there is no evidence for that in the Book of Allah or in the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). It was not done by any of his rightly-guided successors (the Rightly-Guided Caliphs) or the best generations.” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah (2/244)\xa0\nPlease see also the answers to questions no.\xa070317 \xa0and\xa013810 \xa0\nWhy do the Muslims not celebrate the birthday of Jesus as they celebrate the birthday of Prophet Muhammad?\xa0\nWhat the common folk and ignorant among the Muslims do of celebrating the Prophet’s birthday is one of the innovated matters that should be opposed and prohibited. Referring to the celebration of the Prophet’s birthday as proof that it is permissible to celebrate Christmas is a notion that is based on false premises, because celebrating the Prophet’s birthday is not permissible, as it is an innovation that has been introduced into the religion, and whatever is compared to an innovation (for the purpose of justifying it) is also an innovation.\xa0\nIs it permissible to celebrate Christmas?\nThe Christian celebration of what they call Christmas is an innovated and polytheistic celebration. It is not permissible for the Muslims to imitate them in that, and Jesus (peace be upon him) has nothing to do with it or them.\xa0\nRather for the Muslims – in addition to it being an innovation – it comes under the heading of imitating the disbelievers in matters that are unique to them and their religion. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever imitates a people is one of them.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud (3512); classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Sunan Abu Dawud. Its Isnad [chain of narration] was classed as good by Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him), who said:\xa0\n“The least that can be said about this Hadith is that it implies that it is prohibited to imitate them. However the apparent meaning indicates that the one who imitates them is a disbeliever, as Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And if any amongst you takes them as Awliya’\xa0[friends, protectors, helpers, etc.,] then surely he is one of them” [Al-Ma’idah 5:51].”\xa0 (Iqtida’ As-Sirat Al-Mustaqim, p. 82-83)\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam (may Allah have mercy on him) also said:\xa0\n“It has become clear to you that one of the causes of the diminishing of the religion of Allah and its teachings, and the prevalence of disbelief and sin, is imitation of the disbelievers, just as one of the foundations of all good is adhering to the ways and teachings of the Prophets. Hence the introduction of innovations into the religion is regarded as a serious matter, even if it does not involve imitating the disbelievers, so how about if the two matters are combined?!” (Iqtida’ As-Sirat Al-Mustaqim, p. 116)\xa0\nIbn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Congratulating the disbelievers on the occasion of Christmas or any of their other religious festivals is prohibited according to scholarly consensus, because it implies approval of what they follow of disbelief and approving of it for them. Even if he does not approve of this disbelief for himself, it is prohibited for the Muslim to approve of rituals of disbelief or to congratulate someone else for them. Similarly, it is prohibited for the Muslims to imitate the disbelievers by having parties on these occasions, or exchanging gifts, distributing sweets or plates of food, taking time off work, and so on, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever imitates a people is one of them.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud)” (Majmu` Fatawa wa Rasa’il Ibn `Uthaymin, 3/45-46)\xa0\nFor more information on the ruling on joining the disbelievers in their festivals, please see the answers to questions no.\xa01130 \xa0and\xa0145950\nThe harm that results from Muslims celebrating Christmas\nTo sum up: the harm that results from Muslims celebrating Christmas may be summarised in the following points:\xa0\nIt involves imitating the disbelievers whose motivation in holding these parties is their Shirk and disbelief in Allah the Almighty. It is not in accordance with the true teachings of the Prophet of Allah Jesus (peace be upon him), because according to our consensus and theirs he did not prescribe such celebrations for them. So they are a combination of Shirk and innovation, in addition to what they mix with that of immoral and evil actions in these parties, as is well known. So how could we imitate them in that regard?\nCelebration of the Prophet’s birthday is not permissible, because it is an innovation that has been introduced, as stated above. So it is not permissible to use it as an analogy, because if the basis of the analogy is corrupt, the entire analogy is corrupt.\nCelebrating Christmas is an evil act in all circumstances, and we cannot say that it is permissible, because its very foundation is corrupt, because of what happens during it of disbelief, evildoing and sin. Such a thing is not fit to be used as an analogy for anything, and it cannot be said that it is permissible under any circumstances.\nIf we say that this corrupt analogy is sound, then we should be consistent and say: why do we not celebrate the birthday of every Prophet? Are they not all Prophets who were sent from Allah? And no one says this.\nKnowing the exact date of the birth of any of the Prophets is not possible, even our Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). The exact date of his birth is not known, as the historians differed concerning this matter, to the extent that there are nine or more different opinions. So the celebration of the Mawlid is invalid both in terms of the date and of Shari`ah. Hence the matter in its entirety, whether it has to do with the birthday of our Prophet or the birthday of the Prophet of Allah Jesus (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), has no basis at all.\nIbn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Celebrating the eve of the birth of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him and his family) is not valid, whether from the point of view of the date or the point of view of Islamic teachings.” (Fatawa Nur `Ala Ad-Darb, 19/45)\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/178136/why-dont-muslims-celebrate-christmas-if-they-believe-in-jesus
115129,How can a Muslim who is really lacking self-confidence become a more confident person? He has tried so many things but has yet to overcome his nervousness when talking to people. May Allah reward you with good for your effort.,"['Praise be to Allah.Meaning of self-confidence in Islam\nSelf-confidence is an acquired characteristic that the Muslim needs to know how to acquire so that he will be one of those who have self-confidence. But first of all he has to differentiate between self-confidence and arrogance.\xa0\nSelf-confidence means being aware of what Allah has given you of good characteristics and striving accordingly to attain that which will benefit you. If you misuse it, you will be filled with arrogance and self -admiration , which are two destructive problems. If you deny those blessings that have been given to you and the good characteristics that Allah has blessed you with, you will become lazy and apathetic; you will let yourself down and lose the blessings that Allah has given you. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Indeed he succeeds who purifies his ownself (i.e. obeys and performs all that Allah ordered, by following the true Faith of Islamic Monotheism and by doing righteous good deeds).\nAnd indeed he fails who corrupts his ownself (i.e. disobeys what Allah has ordered by rejecting the true Faith of Islamic Monotheism or by following polytheism, or by doing every kind of evil wicked deeds).” [Ash-Shams 91:9-10]\xa0\nIt is worth pointing out something important here, which is that for the Muslim, having self-confidence does not mean that he does not need the help of his Lord, and it does not mean that he does not need his brothers and people in general to advise him and help him. This is what the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) asked his Lord for, which was: not to be left to himself (or to his own devices), not even for the blink of an eye!\xa0\nAbu Bakrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The supplication of the one who is in distress: O Allah, for Your mercy I hope, so do not abandon me to myself even for the blink of an eye. Set all my affairs straight, there is none worthy of worship but You.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud (5090); classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud)\nAl-Nasa’i (10405) narrated from Anas, in a Hadith that was classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih An-Nasa’i, that these words are to be said morning and evening.\xa0\nShaykh Al-`Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\xa0\nWhat is the ruling on saying “So and so has self-confidence” and the like? Is this contrary to the Dua narrated in the Hadith, “do not abandon me to myself even for the blink of an eye”?\nHe replied:\n“There is nothing wrong with that, because what is meant by saying that somebody is self-confident is that he is certain about something and is sure of it. There is no doubt that things may sometimes be attributed to a person on the basis of certainty, and sometimes on the basis of probability, and sometimes on the basis of doubt, and sometimes on the basis of what is most likely to be the case. If he says, for example, “I am certain about that” or “I am certain of myself” or “So and so is certain of himself” or “he is certain about what he is saying”, what is meant is that he is confident about it. There is nothing wrong with that and it is not contrary to the well-known Dua, “do not abandon me to myself even for the blink of an eye,” because the person may be certain of himself by the help of Allah, based on what Allah has given him of knowledge, ability and so on.” (Fatawa Islamiyyah, 4/480)\nHow should a Muslim attain self-confidence?\nSome of the things which we think will increase the Muslim’s self-confidence are:\n\nPutting his trust in his Lord, depending upon Him and seeking support and help from Him. The Muslim cannot do without his Lord, may He be Exalted. As we mentioned above, self-confidence is an acquired characteristic, and the Muslim needs help and support from his Lord. The more he puts his trust in his Lord, the greater his self-confidence will grow and reach the highest level.\n\nWhen Musa (peace be upon him) and his people fled from Pharaoh and his troops, and the two sides saw one another, we see the trust that Musa had in his Lord. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And when the two hosts saw each other, the companions of Musa said: ‘We are sure to be overtaken.’ [Musa] said: ‘Nay, verily, with me is my Lord. He will guide me.’” [Ash-Shu`ara’ 26:61-62]\xa0\n\nFinding out what his strong points are and increasing them; what he does well and developing it; and what his weak points are and trying to deal with them.\xa0\n\nIn order to develop self-confidence it is essential to look with gratitude at what Allah has given you of skills and characteristics, so that this will motivate you to strengthen your self-confidence. With regard to your weak points, you have to try to deal with them and develop them so that they reach the same level as your other, good skills and characteristics.\xa0\n\nIt is very important for the Muslim who is seeking ways of increasing his self-confidence not to repeat negative words, such as saying that he has no self-confidence or that he will never succeed at work.\xa0\nThe Muslim has to set specific goals for his life and check on the outcome time after time, because the person who is self-confident will make sure that his goal is achieved on the basis of good planning and with the help of his Lord.\nThe Muslim should seek righteous companions, because that will give him a motive to succeed and encourage him to make greater efforts. The righteous companions will not overlook their friend’s weak points; rather they will guide him to follow the better path. Thus good companions are one of the factors of success for the confident Muslim.\nHe should not be distracted by previous difficult experiences and past failures, because that will spoil his efforts and make him look down on the success he has achieved. This is not something that the Muslim wants for himself.\n\nHow to control anger in Islam\nControlling one’s behaviour and actions is something that the Muslim can do and it is within his capabilities. Part of that is anger; the Muslim should be confident that he is able, with the help of his Lord, to rid himself of the evils and bad effects of anger and strive to mend his ways and discipline himself to adhere to the laws of Allah. This is something that is very easy indeed for the one who wants to achieve it, so long as he has a great deal of resolve to complete what he wants to achieve of disciplining himself and purifying his soul.\nThe one who wants to rid himself of anger has only to hasten to take action. This, in fact, is what we are lacking. The words are many but the actions are few. So let the Muslim who wants to purify his soul train himself to take action, do what his Lord has commanded him and refrain from what his Lord has forbidden him to do. Thus he will be one of the successful, In Sha Allah.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/115129/what-does-self-confidence-mean-in-islam
