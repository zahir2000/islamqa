512578,"There is an umbrella that has an elastic band that goes around the head, but the head itself is bare. Is it permissible for the pilgrim in ihram to wear it?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThere is a clear prohibition on covering the head with something that sits directly on the head, and on wearing a turban.\nIt was narrated from ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that a man said: O Messenger of Allah, what clothes may the pilgrim in ihram wear? The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “He should not wear a chemise, a turban, trousers, a burnouse or khuffs.”\xa0 Narrated by al-Bukhari (1542) and Muslim (1177). The burnouse is a garment worn by the people of Morocco; it has an attached hood with which the head may be covered.\nIt was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that a man was thrown by his camel, broken his neck and died when we were with the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him ihram) and he was in ihram. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Wash him with water and lotus leaves, and shroud him in two pieces of cloth, but do not put any perfume on him or cover his head, for Allah will raise him on the Day of Resurrection reciting the Talbiyah.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (1267).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Do not cover his head” … This is general in meaning and applies to any kind of headcover.""(Ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘\xa0 7/122).\nWith regard to the pilgrim in ihram covering his head, there are several categories:\n-1-\xa0Covering it with something that sits directly on the head, such as a hat or turban and the like. This is prohibited. The evidence for it being prohibited is the hadith quoted above.\xa0\n-2-\xa0Covering his head with something that does not sit directly on it, such as an umbrella, tent, car roof etc. There is nothing wrong with this, because Umm Husayn (may Allah be pleased with her) said: I did Hajj with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) during the Farewell Pilgrimage, and I saw him when he stoned Jamrat al-‘Aqabah and left on his mount, accompanied by Bilal and Usamah. One of them was leading his mount and the other was holding his garment over the head of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), shading him from the sun. Narrated by Muslim (1298).\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\nThis indicates that it is permissible for the pilgrim in ihram to shade his head with a cloth and the like. This is our view and the view of the majority of scholars, whether he is riding or walking.""(Sharh an-Nawawi ‘ala Muslim\xa0 9/46).\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: There is nothing wrong with the pilgrim in ihram using an umbrella to protect himself from the sun, or seeking shade in a tent or under the roof of a car. ""(Majmu‘ Fatawa Ibn Baz\xa0 17/115).\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This is exactly like an umbrella.""(Ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘\xa0 7/125).\nHe also said:\nShading oneself from the sun using an umbrella is not covering, because the one who is walking beside you can see all of your head. End quote.\n-3-\nCarrying something on one’s head. There is nothing wrong with this because it is usually not done with the intention of covering the head. If it is done with that intention, then it is prohibited.\xa0\nShaykh Ibn Baz said: As for carrying something on one’s head, it does not come under the heading of covering the head that is prohibited, such as carrying food and the like, so long as he is not doing that as a trick (to get around the ruling), because Allah has forbidden His slaves to use trickery in order to do things that He has forbidden.""(Majmu‘ Fatawa Ibn Baz\xa0 17/115).\nSecondly:\nWhat appears to be the case is that the umbrella that has elastic that goes all around the head comes under the ruling on turbans and is subject to the prohibition mentioned in the texts, because the elastic goes all around the head, as a turban does, and covers part of the head.\nIt says in al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah al-Kuwaitiyyah (2/154):\nIt is also haram to cover part of the head with something that is regarded as covering or is intended for the purpose of covering… So it is not permissible for him to tie a bandana or band around his head, or to put on his head anything that sits directly on it and stays there. End quote.\nThe elastic which holds the umbrella hat in place is like a band and more so, as is well known and is widely seen.\nThe Permanent Committee for Ifta’ was asked:\nThis is a sample for you to see of a small umbrella that offers protection from the sun, and is tied to the head. The manufacturers of this small umbrella want to know whether it is allowed to use it during Hajj so that they can distribute it, either as gifts or as an item that is sold. Therefore I hope that you can tell me your opinion regarding that, so that we may proceed.\nThey replied: This band with which the umbrella that protects against the sun is tied to the head comes under the same ruling as turbans. It is not permissible for the pilgrim in ihram to wear it, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The pilgrim in ihraam should not wear a chemise, or a turban, or trousers, or a burnouse.” The authenticity of the hadith is agreed upon.""(Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah\xa0vol. 2, 10/141).\nBased on that:\nIt is not permissible for men in ihram to wear the umbrella hat that is tied to the head. They can do without that by using the type of umbrella that is carried in the hand.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/512578/is-it-permissible-for-the-pilgrim-in-ihram-to-wear-an-umbrella-hat-that-sits-directly-on-the-head
330743,"In some places, some say that Allah is 'INFINITELY' merciful. Now, as we know, Rasul (S) said that, Allah created Rahmah and kept 99 protions for him, doesn't it make the mercy of Allah ""Finite""? It seems that It's something created, which is in a Finite amount, 100 portions in total. Also, disbelievers won't get it in the judgement day. So then, it seems it is also reserved for a Finite audience.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly: the mercy of ALlah is of two types\nThe mercy of Allah is of two types:\nThe first type is an attribute of the Essence of Allah, may He be exalted. This is not created and it is infinite, for He is the Most Gracious (ar-Rahman), the Most Merciful (ar-Rahim). {And your Lord is the Forgiving, full of mercy} [al-Kahf 18:58].\nThe second type is created mercy, which is composed of one hundred parts of which Allah sent down one in this world, and He has kept the other ninety-nine parts by which He will show mercy to His slaves on the Day of Resurrection.\nAl-Bukhari (6469) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “Indeed Allah created mercy, on the day He created it, in one hundred parts. Then He kept ninety-nine parts of it with Him and sent one part for all of His creation. If the disbeliever knew of all that there is with Allah of mercy, he would never despair of Paradise, and if the believer knew of all that there is with Allah of punishment, he would never feel safe from the Fire.”\nMuslim (2725) narrated it as follows: “Indeed, Allah has one hundred parts of mercy, of which He sent one part to be shared between the jinn, humankind, the animals and the vermin. By virtue of it they show compassion to one another and show mercy to one another, and by virtue of it the wild animal shows compassion to its offspring. And Allah has kept behind ninety-nine parts of mercy, by which He will show mercy to His slaves on the Day of Resurrection.”\nIn Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah (2/400) it says: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Indeed Allah created, on the day He created the heavens and the earth, one hundred parts of mercy…” What is meant by the mercy that Allah created? Is it the divine attribute – exalted be Allah above that – or is it mercy that was created and is only for this ummah, and the divine attribute is something else?\nAnswer: The mercy that is mentioned in the hadith is created mercy. Allah created one hundred parts of mercy, of which He sent down one part, by virtue of which people show mercy towards one another. And He has kept with him ninety-nine parts of mercy for the Day of Resurrection.\nThis mercy is something other than the divine attribute of mercy, for the attributes of Allah are not created; they are attributes of His essence, and Allah, with His attributes, is the Creator and is not created. End quote.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Send down one part of Your mercy”– mercy is of two types:\n\nThat mercy which is an attribute of Allah. This is not created and is not separate from the Essence of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, as He says (interpretation of the meaning: {And your Lord is the Forgiving, full of mercy} [al-Kahf 18:58]. Therefore He cannot be asked to send down this type of mercy.\nMercy that is created, and is one of the impacts of Allah’s mercy, so it is called mercy, as Allah, may He be exalted, says of Paradise in the hadith qudsi: “You are My mercy; by means of you I will bestow My mercy on whomever I will.”(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa\xa08/430).\n\nSecondly: The disbelievers receive mercy in this world\nThe disbelievers receive mercy in this world, hence Allah gives them good health, wealth and children, and He sent the Messengers to them and sent down the Books to them. But in the hereafter, He will deal with them according to His justice, so He will cause them to abide forever in the fire of Hell.\nBecause the disbeliever has shown stubbornness and rejected his Lord and Creator, he is not deserving of mercy.\nIbn al-Jawzi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: One of the signs of Allah’s mercy is His sending of the Messengers and giving the sinners respite. If the disbeliever denies Him, then he is regarded as stubborn, so he is not deserving of mercy. End quote from Kashf al-Mushkil (1/94).\nIf the disbeliever, despite his disbelief and stubbornness, were admitted to Paradise like the believer, that would be contrary to justice. Hence Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Or do those who commit evils think We will make them like those who have believed and done righteous deeds - [make them] equal in their life and their death? Evil is that which they judge}\xa0[al-Jathiyah 45:21]\n{Or should we treat those who believe and do righteous deeds like corrupters in the land? Or should We treat those who fear Allah like the wicked?}\xa0[Sad 38:28]\n{Then will We treat the Muslims like the criminals?\nWhat is [the matter] with you? How do you judge?}\xa0[al-Qalam 68:35-36].\nAllah, may He be glorified, is merciful and just; His mercy does not mean that He will not punish those who deserve to be punished, because that is what is dictated by His justice and also His wisdom.\nSee also the answer to question no. 211871 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/330743/the-difference-between-mercy-that-is-created-and-mercy-that-is-a-divine-attribute
480116,"I live and work in Germany, praise be to Allah. I have saved up some money, and I want to buy a gold ingot through the bank. I have an account with this bank, and the way to do it is either to buy online and they will keep a piece of gold in my name, and deduct the money from my account, or I can order it directly from the bank, and they will do the same thing [that is, keep it for me]. Is this permissible? Is it regarded technically as receiving the item, meaning that it could be considered the same as receiving it in my hand?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nWhen buying gold for cash, it is stipulated that the exchange must be done as soon as the transaction is concluded.\nThat is because of the report narrated by Muslim (1587) from ‘Ubadah ibn as-Samit (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Gold for gold, silver for silver, wheat for wheat, barley for barley, dates for dates, salt for salt, like for like, same for same, hand to hand. But if these commodities differ, then sell as you like, as long as it is hand to hand.”\nCurrencies come under the same rulings as gold and silver.\nIn a statement of the Islamic Fiqh Council belonging to the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC) it says:\nWith regard to the rulings on currencies, they are regarded as money because items are valued and priced on the basis of these currencies. They are subject to the same rulings as gold and silver with regard to riba (usury), zakah, sallam transactions (payment in advance) and all other rulings.\nEnd quote from Majallat al-Majma‘, issue no. 3, vol. 3, p. 1650; issue no. 5, vol. 3, p. 1609.\nWhat is meant by receiving money is receiving it in one’s hand in a real sense or in a technical sense, when it is deposited in the seller’s account.\nReceiving gold in a real sense means that you receive it yourself or through a proxy who is acting on your behalf.\nReceiving it in a technical sense means that the gold is deposited in an account that belongs to you in such a way that you are able to take the gold itself – not its value – from the account at any time after the deal is concluded.\nSo it is essential that the exchange of the two items (the money and the gold) takes place in the sitting in which the deal is concluded, meaning that the money goes into the seller’s account and you receive the gold in a real sense in your hand, or in the hand of the proxy acting on your behalf, or the gold is deposited in an account that belongs to you.\nIt says in al-Ma‘ayir ash-Shar‘iyyah (p.1330, no. 57) regarding gold: When selling gold for gold or for silver or for any other currency, the two items must be exchanged in the sitting in which the deal is concluded, either in a real sense or in a technical sense. End quote.\nIf the gold will not come into your account until after a while, or you cannot dispose of it until after a while, then the required exchange has not taken place, and the transaction comes under the heading of riba an-nasi’ah, which is haram.\nSecondly:\nIf the bank can buy the gold for you, and the bank is able to receive the gold in the same sitting in which the deal is concluded, then there is nothing wrong with that, as the bank will be acting as a proxy on your behalf.\nSimilarly, if the bank owns gold which you can buy from it, the exchange can be done on the spot, and the gold will go into an account that belongs to you in the same sitting, there is nothing wrong with that, because that is technically taking possession of it.\nBut if these exchange cannot be done on the spot, it is haram to buy the gold.\nThirdly:\nIslamic standards permit a type of technically receiving the gold when buying gold ingots. This is as follows:\nTechnically taking possession [of the gold] may be done by identifying a specific ingot and enabling the purchaser to take possession of it and dispose of it; or by issuing a certificate of ownership which proves ownership of a particular ingot which is distinguished from others (“allocated”) by means of numbers stamped on the ingot and similar markings that distinguish it from others, on condition that the certificate is issued on the day on which the transaction is done (Trade Date T+0) by an entity that is recognised by law and by custom, which allows the purchaser to take physical possession of the purchased ingot whenever he wishes.\nBased on that, it is not permissible to sell a non-specified ingot without the purchaser taking possession of it in a real sense. That includes what is known in the market as “unallocated” ingots. End quote.\nIf these guidelines are adhered to and implemented, it is permissible to buy the ingot from the website or from the bank, and the gold will be a trust that is held by the bank, but the bank will not be liable for it except in the case of wilful damage or negligence.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/480116/what-is-the-ruling-on-buying-gold-ingots-from-the-internet-or-the-bank-and-keeping-them-for-the-client
