14321,"If I change my dress, do I break my wudu? Is there any difference in this rule between a woman and a man?","['Praise be to Allah.Does changing clothes break wudu?\nChanging clothes does not break one’s wudu if the person is in a state of purity and does not do any of the things that break wudu. Men and women are the same in this regard.\xa0\nWhat breaks wudu\nThe things that break wudu are:\xa0\n\nAny discharge from the front or back passage (urine, stools, wind, etc.), except for wind emitted from a woman’s front passage – that does not break wudu.\xa0\nEmission of urine or stools from anywhere other than the urethra or anus.\xa0\nLosing one’s mind, which may mean losing it altogether by losing one’s mental faculties, which is insanity, or by losing it temporarily for a certain length of time for some reason such as sleep, unconsciousness, intoxication, etc.\xa0\nTouching one’s penis , because of the hadith of Basrah bint Safwan, who heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “Whoever touches his penis, let him do wudu.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, al-Taharah, 154. al-Albani said in Sahih Sunan Abi Dawud, no. 166, it is sahih)\xa0\nEating camel meat , because of the hadith of Jabir ibn Samurah, who said that a man asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “Should we do wudu after eating camel meat?” He said, “Yes.” (Narrated by Muslim, al-Hayd, 539).\xa0\n\nIt should be noted that touching a woman’s body does not break one’s wudu , whether that is done with feelings of desire or otherwise, unless anything is emitted as a result of that touching.” (See al-Sharh al-Mumti’ by Ibn ‘Uthaymin, vol. 1, p. 219-250) (Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, vol. 5, p. 264)\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/14321/does-changing-clothes-break-wudu
409541,"I took a loan from university for over 2 years. The amount was more than 10,000 euros (about 15,000). I have to pay only 10,000 euros back once I'm done with university, and if I don't do it by a certain time, I have to pay interest for it. But I can keep the rest of the money (5,000 euros). So is this money haram? Is all of it haram, or only the 10,000€ that I have to pay back? Can I continue to take the loan?","['Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible for the lender and borrower to make an agreement that if the borrower is late in paying off the loan, he will pay an extra amount in return for that delay, because this extra amount is riba (usury), and it is not permissible for the Muslim to agree to deal in riba, even if he is determined to pay off within the specified time.\nPlease see the answer to question no. 136378 .\nBased on that, you must repent from entering into this unlawful contract, by regretting what you have done and resolving not to take out such a loan again.\nAs for the money, it is permissible for you, because the one who takes out a riba-based loan takes possession of the money he borrows, even if he incurs the sin of riba. This is the view of Abu Hanifah and Ahmad, and it is one of view of the Shafa‘is.\nSee: al-Manfa‘ah fi’l-Qard by Dr. ‘Abdullah al-‘Umrani (p. 245-254).\nWhat you must do is strive to pay off the loan within the stipulated time, so that you will not actually pay any riba, and so that you will not be subject to the warning issued to the one who pays riba. If you pay the loan on time, and you do not pay the interest (riba), then we hope that Allah will pardon you for getting involved in this contract and what it involved of stipulating riba, which is haram.\nAs for the extra money, which you can keep and not have to pay it off, this is a gift from the university to you, so there is nothing wrong with you making use of it.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/409541/he-took-out-a-university-loan-on-condition-that-if-he-is-late-in-paying-it-off-he-will-pay-interest
