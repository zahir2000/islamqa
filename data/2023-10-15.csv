109200,"If a man is junub and he cut his nails or hair, is there any blame on him for that? Because if one who is junub cuts his hair or nails, all parts of his body will come back to him in the hereafter, and he will be resurrected on the Day of Resurrection with some janabah on him, commensurate with what he cut of that. Is this the case or not?","['Praise be to Allah.It is soundly narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), in the hadith of Hudhayfah (may Allah be pleased with him) and in the hadith of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that when mention was made to him of one who is junub, he said: “The believer does not become impure (najis).” In Sahih al-Hakim it adds: “whether he is alive or dead.”\nI do not know of any shar‘i evidence to suggest that it is disliked (makrooh) to remove the hair or nails of one who is junub. Rather the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to one who became Muslim: “Cast off the hair of kufr (disbelief) and get circumcised.” Thus he instructed the one who had become Muslim to do ghusl, and he did not instruct him to delay getting circumcised or removing his hair until after doing ghusl. The fact that he said this in general terms indicates that both things are permissible. Similarly, the menstruating woman is instructed to comb her hair when doing ghusl, even though some hairs may be lost as a result of combing the hair.

38079,What is the minimum distance of travelling at which fasting is excused?,"['Praise be to Allah.The majority of scholars are of the view that the distance at which a traveller may join prayers and not fast is forty-eight miles.\xa0\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Mughni:\xa0\nThe view of Abu `Abd-Allah [i.e., Imam Ahmad] is that it is not permissible to shorten the prayers for a distance of less than sixteen Farsakhs, and a Farsakh is three miles, so the distance is forty-eight miles . This was the estimation of Ibn `Abbas. He said: From `Usfan to Makkah, or from Al-Taif to Makkah, or from Jeddah to Makkah.”\xa0\nBased on this, the distance at which it is permissible to shorten prayers is the distance of two days’ travel aiming directly for that destination. This is the view of Ibn `Abbas and Ibn `Umar, and the view of Malik, Al-Layth and al-Shafi`i.\xa0\nThe equivalent in kilometres is approximately 80 km.\xa0\nShaykh Ibn Baz said in Majmu` Al-Fatawa (12/267), explaining what is meant by travelling:\xa0\n“The view of the majority of scholars is that this is equivalent to approximately eighty kilometres for one who travels by car, plane or ship. This distance is what is called travelling according to the custom of the Muslims. So if a person travels by camel, car, plane or ship, for this distance or more, he is regarded as a traveller.”\xa0\nThe Standing Committee was asked (8/90) about the distance at which a traveller may shorten his prayers, and can a taxi-driver who covers more than three hundred kilometres shorten his prayer?\xa0\nThey replied:\xa0\n“The distance at which a traveller may shorten his prayers is approximately 80 km according to the view of the majority of scholars. It is permissible for a taxi driver or anyone else to shorten his prayers, if he is going to cover the distance mentioned at the beginning of the question, or more.”\xa0\nSome scholars are of the view that travelling is not to be defined by a specific distance, rather it should be defined according to custom: whatever people customarily regard as travelling is the travelling to which the Shar`i rulings apply, such as joining and shortening prayers, and not fasting .\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam said in Al-Fatawa (24/106):\xa0\n“The evidence supports those who regard shortening prayers and not fasting as being applicable to all types of travel and do not single out one kind of travelling to the exclusion of another. This view is the correct one.”\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin was asked in Fatawa Arkan Al-Islam (p. 381) about the distance at which a traveller may shorten his prayers and whether it is permissible to join prayers without shortening them.\xa0\nHe replied:\xa0\n“The distance at which a traveller may shorten his prayers was defined by some of the scholars as being approximately eighty-three kilometres, and some defined it as being what is customarily regarded as travelling, even if the distance is not 80 km, and that what the people say is not travelling should not be regarded as such, even if it is as far as one hundred kilometres.\xa0\nThe latter view is the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him), because Allah did not state a specific distance that makes shortening prayers permissible, and neither did the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).\xa0\nAnas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) said: If the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) set out for a journey of three miles or three farsakhs, he would pray two Rak`ahs. (Narrated by Muslim, 691)\xa0\nThe view of Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah is closer to what is correct.\xa0\nThere is nothing wrong, if there is a conflict between customary views, in going by the opinion which suggests that travel should be defined in terms of distance, because this was the view of some of the Imams and scholars and Mujtahids. So there is nothing wrong with that in sha Allah. But so long as custom gives a clear definition, then referring to what is customary is the right thing to do.”\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/38079/minimum-distance-for-breaking-fast-and-shortening-prayers
112111,"Some of the jurists say that reciting the basmalah in the middle of a surah is mustahabb, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Every important matter that does not start with ‘Bismillah ir-Rahman ir-Rahim (in the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful),’ is devoid of blessings.” Is it recommended, or is it not prescribed?","['Praise be to Allah.The correct view is that if a person recites the basmalah when beginning his reading of Quran in the middle of a surah, that is not recommended, because Allah says in His Book (interpretation of the meaning):\n{When you recite the Quran, seek refuge with Allah from the accursed Shaytan}\xa0[An-Nahl 16:98].\nHe did not instruct us to say anything else.

89677,"I am short-tempered and quick to swear oaths, and I often break the oaths that I swear. I do not know how many expiations I owe for broken oaths. I want to fulfill what I owe of expiations. What should I do? Is it permissible, in expiation of the oath, to invite family and relatives to lunch? If I swore an oath to divorce my wife (if the oath is broken) and broke it, does that require expiation? Please note that I do not know what my intention was when I swore the oath to divorce my wife, but I think it was most likely that I did not intend to actually divorce her.","[""Praise be to Allah.Is it OK to swear oaths frequently?\nIt is disliked to swear oaths frequently, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And do not obey every worthless habitual swearer.” [Al-Qalam 68:10]. This criticism of one who does that implies that what he does is disliked, as Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) stated. (Al-Mughni, 13/439)\nExpiation for multiple broken oaths\nIf a person swore many oaths, and broke them but did not offer an expiation for any of them, then there are two scenarios:\n\nIf the many oaths had to do with a single matter, such as if he said: “By Allah, I will not smoke”, then he broke that oath and did not offer an expiation, then he swore the same oath again, then this requires one expiation .\nIf the oaths had to do with different matters, such as if he said, “By Allah, I will not smoke” , or “By Allah I will not wear (such and such)”, or “By Allah, I will not go to a certain place”, then he broke all of the oaths and he has not offered an expiation for any of them, then does he have to offer one expiation or several? There is a difference of opinion among the Muslim jurists concerning this matter. The majority of scholars are of the view that he must offer several expiations, and this is the correct view, because they were oaths in which he swore to do different things, so each oath is to be considered on its own merits. (See: Al-Mughni, 9/406)\n\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: I am a young man who swore by Allah more than three times that I would repent from a prohibited deed. My question is: do I have to offer an expiation once or three times, and what is my expiation?\nHe replied:\xa0\n“You have to offer one expiation, which is to feed ten poor persons, or to clothe them, or to free a slave. Whoever cannot afford to do that should fast for three days, because Allah, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning): “Allah will not impose blame upon you for what is meaningless in your oaths, but He will impose blame upon you for [breaking] what you intended of oaths. So its expiation is the feeding of ten needy people from the average of that which you feed your [own] families or clothing them or the freeing of a slave. But whoever cannot find [or afford it] - then a fast of three days [is required]. That is the expiation for oaths when you have sworn. But guard your oaths.” [Al-Ma’idah 5:89]\nThis applies to any oath that is sworn to do something or refrain from something, even if the oath is sworn (and broken) repeatedly; only one expiation is required, if the individual has not already expiated for the first instance. But if he has already offered an expiation for the first instance, then he swore the oath again, then he must offer a second expiation if he breaks the oath. Similarly, if he swears the oath a third time, and has already offered expiation for the second instance, then he must offer a third expiation (if he breaks the oath again).\nHowever, if he repeatedly swore oaths to do several different things, or to stop doing several different things, then he must offer an expiation for each oath, such as if he said: “By Allah, I will not speak to So and so”, and “By Allah, I will not eat such and such,” and “By Allah, I shall not travel to such and such a place”, or he said: “By Allah, I will surely speak to So and so”, and “By Allah, I shall surely hit him”, and the like.\nWhat is required when feeding the poor (as an expiation) is to give each poor person half a Sa‘ of the local staple food; this is equivalent to approximately one and a half kilograms.\nWith regard to clothing, it refers to what is sufficient to cover a person when praying, such as a chemise (Thobe) or upper and lower garment (Rida’ and Izar). If he offers them dinner or lunch, that is sufficient, because of the general meaning of the verse quoted above. And Allah is the source of help.” (Majmu` Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 23/145)\nWhat happens if you don't know the number of broken oaths\nIf you are not certain of the number of oaths, then try to work out the approximate number, then offer expiations for that approximate number – if the oaths had to do with different matters – until you think that you most likely have done what is required of you.\nFeeding relative as an expiation for broken oaths\nIf your relatives are poor and needy, and you invite ten of them to lunch or dinner , that will be sufficient as an expiation for your oath, whether you invite them all together or at different times.\nWhoever is not able to free a slave, feed poor persons or clothe them, must fast for three days, as mentioned in the verse quoted above.\nDoes swearing an oath to divorce one’s wife count as divorce?\nSwearing an oath to divorce one’s wife is a grave matter , which results in the divorce counting as such if the oath is broken , according to the majority of jurists. Therefore, it is essential to beware of doing that.\nSome of these scholars are of the view that it depends on the intention behind the oath. If the intention was to threaten someone, urge her to do something, prevent her from doing something, or prove something to be true or false, then the oath was broken, then he must offer an expiation for breaking the oath .\xa0\nHowever, if he intended to divorce her, then the divorce counts as such. Each person knows his own intention; if he thinks that one of the two matters is most likely to be the case, then he must act according to what he thinks was likely to be the case.\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/89677/expiation-for-multiple-broken-oaths
