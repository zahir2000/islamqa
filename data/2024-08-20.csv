505019,"The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There are three whose supplication is not rejected… the fasting person when he breaks his fast.” Does the time specified by the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) end as soon as the time for Maghrib begins, or does it end when the fasting person breaks his fast, even if he delays breaking his fast until sometime after the adhan?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There are three whose supplication is not rejected: the just ruler, the fasting person until he breaks his fast, and the supplication of one who is wronged, which rises above the clouds and the gates of the heavens are opened for it, and the Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, says: ‘By My glory, I shall help you (against the wrongdoer), even if it is after a while.” Narrated by Ahmad in al-Musnad (13/410); at-Tirmidhi (3598) and Ibn Majah (1752).\nAt-Tirmidhi said: This is a hasan hadith. It was classed as hasan by al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar, as stated in al-Futuhat ar-Rabbaniyyah by Ibn ‘Allan (4/338). It was classed as sahih on the basis of corroborating reports by the commentators on al-Musnad.\nIbn Hibban narrated it in al-Ihsan (8 /214) under the chapter heading: The hope that the supplication of the fasting person at the time of breaking his fast will be answered. End quote.\nIbn Majah (1753) narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘As said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There is a supplication that will not be rejected for the fasting person when he breaks his fast.”\nThe commentators on as-Sunan said:\nIts isnad is hasan. End quote.\nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 26879 .\nSecondly:\nThese hadiths may be understood as referring to the breaking of the fast as mentioned in the religious texts, which is when the time for breaking the fast begins with the setting of the sun.\nOr it may be that what is referred to is the actual breaking of the fast, by eating or drinking, even if that is some time after sunset.\nThe second view is the one that is more likely to be correct.\nAl-Kamal ad-Dumayri (may Allah have mercy on him) said: In Ibn Majah (1753), it is narrated from Ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘As (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When the fasting person breaks his fast, he has a supplication that is answered.” And Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) used to say when breaking his fast: “O Allah, thirst is gone, the veins are moistened and the reward is certain if Allah wills. O Allah, O Oft-Forgiving, forgive me.”\nFrom the supplication mentioned, it may be understood that it is to be recited after breaking the fast. This is clear.\nEnd quote from an-Najm al-Wahhaj fi Sharh al-Minhaj (3/325).\nIbn ‘Allan (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Chapter: What is to be said when breaking the fast.\nIt says in al-Khadim: ash-Shafa‘i also stated that it is recommended to recite the dhikr mentioned when breaking the fast, but he did not explain whether it is to be recited before breaking the fast. His wording is more likely to mean that, and the word “aftartu (I have broken my fast)” could refer to when the fast is to be broken, which is when that time begins. All of that is possible. But what appears to be the case is that it may be after breaking the fast, or before, or whilst breaking the fast; it is all the same, [so whenever he recites this supplication], he will have done what is recommended. I say: What is proven is offering the supplication after breaking the fast.\nEnd quote from al-Futuhat ar-Rabbaniyyah ‘ala al-Adhkar an-Nawawiyyah (4/339).\nConclusion:\nIt is recommended for the fasting person to offer supplication, whether he hastens to break his fast or delays it, and whether he offers supplication after the time for breaking the fast begins and before he actually breaks his fast, or whilst he is breaking his fast, or after that. The matter is broad in scope, in sha Allah.\nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 293455 .\nBut it should be noted that the Sunnah is to hasten to break the fast, as has been explained previously in the answer to question no. 50019 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/505019/should-the-supplication-of-one-who-is-fasting-be-offered-when-the-time-for-breaking-the-fast-begins-or-when-he-actually-breaks-the-fast-even-if-that-is-delayed
11014,"We have heard that the `Awrah of a woman in front of other women is from the navel to the knees. Is this correct? Especially since in banquet halls we see women who come – may Allah keep us safe and sound – wearing short or see-through clothes, or garments with cut-away designs which show her calves, or they wear light and filmy garments, or things that leave a part of the chest or back uncovered… So Muslim women come out and they look like dancers in the non-Muslim countries or improperly-dressed actresses on the screen. If we tell them not to do that, they say, There is nothing wrong with that; women’s `Awrah is from the navel to the knee. Modesty has disappeared and women are becoming argumentative and imitating the non-Muslims, and the problem has reached overwhelming proportions. Please advise us, may Allah reward you.","['Praise be to Allah.`Awrah of women in front of men\nAll of a woman is `Awrah in front of non-Mahram men , and it is not permissible for her to appear before men even if she is covered, if there is the fear of fitnah (temptation) because of looking at her and seeing how tall she is and how she walks.\xa0\nA Woman’s `Awrah in Front of Women\nConcerning what was said about a woman’s `Awrah in front of other women being from the navel to the knee, this applies only when she is in her house among her sisters and the women of her household.\xa0\nThe basic principle is still that she should cover all of her body lest she be taken as an example and this evil practice become widespread among women.\xa0\nSimilarly, she must also cover her charms in front of her Mahrams and strange women lest some of her Mahrams be tempted by her or lest some of the women describe her to others.\nIt was reported in the Hadith that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No woman should describe another woman to her husband so that it is as if he can see her.”\xa0\nWhat this means is that if her charms, such as her chest, her shoulders, her stomach, her back, her arms, her neck and her calves, become visible, whoever sees that will inevitably have an impression of her, and usually women talk about what they have seen to their families, male and female alike. So a woman may mention that in front of non-Mahram men [i.e., men who are not Mahrams of the woman being described] in a manner that may provoke them to pursue her, or which may cause bad people to form an attachment to her.\nFor this reason, women have to cover their charms – such as their chests, backs, arms, calves, etc., - even in front of Mahrams and other women.\xa0\nObserving modesty in parties, schools, and hospitals\nThis covering becomes even more essential in parties, leisure facilities, hospitals and schools, even if there are only women present, because some non-Mahram men and adolescent boys may see them or take pictures of them naked which will be a cause of temptation to those who see them.\xa0\nA Warning to Women against making Wanton Displays\nA stern warning has been issued to those who make a wanton display of themselves and wear see-through or tight clothing, when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:\n“There are two kinds of the people of Hell … women who are clothed yet naked, walking with an enticing gait with something on their heads looking like the humps of camels, leaning to one side. They will not enter Paradise or even smell its fragrance.”\xa0\nWhat this means is that they are wearing see-through or tight clothes which show the size of their frame, or there are openings cut in the fabric which show their chests, breasts and other charms. This is widespread in parties and in general gatherings.\nFor more details, please see these answers:\xa043289 ,\xa026304 ,\xa0102187 ,\xa0310812 , 153367 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11014/a-womans-awrah-in-front-of-women
350573,"I have an autistic child and I always pray for his death, because I am no longer able to support him, especially since he is growing up. His father left us, and he has become strong and beats me. I tried ruqyah and took him to Islamic centres and tried to educate him. I made many vows, but Allah did not want him to be healed, so what is the ruling on my praying for his death, because I say: O Allah, heal him or take him sooner rather than later?","['Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to offer such a supplication, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade praying against oneself or one’s children.\nMuslim (3014) narrated from Jabir ibn ‘Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not pray against yourselves, do not pray against your children, and do not pray against your wealth, lest you happen to do that at a time when whatever Allah is asked for, He grants it, and your supplication is answered.”\nIf you believe that Allah, may He be exalted, will answer your supplication for this child to die, then why do you not believe that Allah will answer your supplication for him to be healed and guided, and to mend his ways?\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\nThere is a woman whose oldest son imitates his father in doing some prohibited actions, hence she hates him because of his imitation of his father in doing prohibited actions and not fearing Allah, and she prays for his death for that reason. She is asking about the ruling on praying against her son.\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) replied:\nAs for praying for her son’s death, this is wrong. It is not appropriate for anyone who sees a misguided person to pray for his death; rather what he should do is try to advise him as much as he is able. He should also ask Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, to guide him, for all things are in the hand of Allah, and people’s hearts are between two of His fingers, and He turns them however He wills. How often have people despaired of things and thought that they could never happen, then Allah, may He be exalted, made them easy to attain. So do not think it unlikely that Allah, may He be glorified, will guide your son. Pray for him to be guided, and keep on advising him, for Allah has power over all things.""(Fatawa Nur ‘ala ad-Darb\xa0 6/13-14).\nOur advice to you is to stop praying against your son, and let your supplication be for his healing and guidance, and for him to attain what is best in this world and the hereafter. Ask Allah to bless you by making him dutiful and righteous, and to ward off from you the harm he is causing.\nYou can also seek the help of one of your male mahrams, asking him to be constantly in touch with you, so that your son can be wary of him and refrain from harming you.\nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 75399 .\nWe ask Allah, the Most Generous, to heal your son and relieve your distress.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/350573/her-son-is-autistic-and-assaults-her-should-she-pray-for-his-death
195117,Is it permissible to pray wearing clothes on which there is some impurity that has dried?,"['Praise be to Allah.The importance of purity in prayer\nIn order for prayer to be valid, it is stipulated that the worshipper should avoid having any impurity on his clothing . Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And your garments purify” [Al-Muddaththir 74:4]\xa0\nProphet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said, concerning menstrual blood that gets onto a woman’s garment: “She should scratch it, then rub it with water, then wash it, then pray in it.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 227 and Musli, 291)\xa0\nAbu Dawud (650) narrated that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) said: While the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was leading his companions in prayer, he took off his shoes and placed them to his left. When the people saw that, they also took off their shoes. When the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) finished praying, he said: “What made you take off your shoes?” They said: We saw you take off your shoes, so we took off our shoes. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Jibril (peace be upon him) came to me and told me that there was some filth on them.”\xa0\nCan one pray in impure clothes?\nThere is no differentiation between dry impurity and wet impurity with regard to it being obligatory to remove it when wanting to pray. That is because of the general meaning of the texts referred to above, which indicate that it is stipulated that one’s clothing should be pure when praying. They do not differentiate between dry impurity and wet impurity.\xa0\nThe words in the hadith quoted above: “She should scratch it, then rub it with water” indicate that dry impurity should be removed, because scratching is only done in the case of something that has dried out.\xa0\nShaykh Salih Al-Fawzan (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\nIf urine has got onto a garment then dried, is it still impure? Is it obligatory to wash the wet spot? If a person touches it, does he have to wash the area that touched it?\xa0\nHe replied:\xa0\n“Impurity cannot be removed from a garment except by washing it with purifying water. It is not sufficient merely to let the impurity dry out. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said, concerning menstrual blood that got onto a woman’s garment: “She should scratch it, then rub it with water, then wash it, then pray in it.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim) So it is essential to wash the impurity from the garment before praying in it.\xa0\nIf a person touches a wet impurity, then he must wash off whatever part of his body touched it, because the impurity has been transferred to it.\xa0\nAs for dry impurity, he does not have to wash whatever part of his body that touched it, because the impurity is not transferred to him in that case.”\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/195117/can-one-pray-in-impure-clothes
