236653,"What is the ruling on watching some programs, including Islamic ones, on unofficial YouTube channels? They were originally TV programs, and some of them are on channels which write “All rights reserved” on their programs; in the case of some other channels, I do not know whether they put copyright on their programs are not.","['Praise be to Allah.Academic material, inventions, books, programs and apps usually write “All rights reserved” at the beginning. What is meant by this phrase is that the intellectual property rights and patents connected to this product are protected and reserved for the author or producer of this work.\nSome scholars have stated that reserving rights for the authors or producers does not mean that it is not allowed to copy these products, or to watch them, photocopy them or download them – in whatever format – if that is done for the purpose of personal benefit.\nBut if the aim is to make a profit and trade in that product, by publishing and distributing it, that is prohibited, because it is a transgression against the financial rights of the author or producer.\nWe have previously discussed the Islamic rulings on this issue in the answers to questions no. 237588 and 226230 .\nBased on that, there is nothing wrong with listening to and watching these programs, and benefitting from what they contain of goodness. It is all the same whether the authors stated that all rights are reserved for them or not.\nIf there is any sin, it is on the one who published or posted it, not on the viewer.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/236653/ruling-on-watching-tv-programs-on-youtube-when-the-producers-of-some-of-them-have-claimed-copyright
21524,"Some people believe that the Prophet Muhammad [(peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)] is ""Shaheed"" and is in BArzakh where he can hear us if we send 'durood' on him and also if we ask his 'wasta' [by virtue of his closeness to Allah] in praying to God.","['Praise be to Allah.Is Prophet Muhammad alive?\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is alive in his grave in the sense of the life of Al-Barzakh , so he enjoys the blessings that Allah has prepared for him as a reward for his great good actions that he did in this world. But the life in the grave is not like the life of this world, or the life in the Hereafter. Rather it is the life of Al-Barzakh which comes in between his life in this world and his life in the Hereafter. Hence we know that he died as other Prophets and other people before him died. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And We granted not to any human being immortality before you (O Muhammad); then if you die, would they live forever?” [Al-Anbiya’ 21:34]\xa0\n“Whatsoever is on it (the earth) will perish. And the Face of your Lord full of Majesty and Honour will remain forever.” [Ar-Rahman 55:26,27]\n“Verily, you (O Muhammad) will die, and verily, they (too) will die.” [Az-Zumar 39:30]\nAnd there are other verses which also indicate that Allah caused him to die. Moreover, the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) washed him, shrouded him, offered the funeral prayer for him and buried him; if he had been alive in the worldly sense, they would not have done the same as is done for others who die.\xa0\nFatimah (may Allah be pleased with her) asked Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) for her inheritance from her father (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) because she was convinced that he had died, and no one among the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) differed with her concerning that. Rather Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) responded to her request by saying that nothing could be inherited from the Prophets. \xa0\nThe Companions agreed unanimously to choose a caliph for the Muslims to succeed the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him),\xa0and that was done with the appointment of Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) as a caliph. If the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had been alive in a worldly sense, they would not have done that. So this indicates that there was consensus among them that he had indeed died.\xa0\nWhen the tribulations (Fitan) and problems increased during the time of `Uthman and `Ali (may Allah be pleased with them both), and before and after that, they did not go to his grave to consult him or ask him for a way out of those tribulations and problems, or the way to solve them. If he had been alive in a worldly sense, they would not have overlooked that when they were in such great need of someone to save them from the trials that surrounded them. \xa0\nWith regard to the soul of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), it is in the highest part of `Illiyyin, because he is the best of creation, and because Allah has given him Al-Wasilah which is the highest position in Paradise.\xa0\nThe life of Al-Barzakh is a special life. The Prophets and the martyrs are alive in Al-Barzakh as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The Prophets are alive and they pray in their graves.” (Narrated by Al-Mundhiri and Al-Bayhaqi who classed it as authentic because of corroborating reports in Al-Bukhari and Muslim.)\xa0\nAllah Says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And say not of those who are killed in the way of Allah, `They are dead.’ Nay, they are living, but you perceive (it) not.” [Al-Baqarah 2:154]\nThis is a special life, the nature of which is known to Allah. It is not like the life of this world in which the soul remains with the body. \xa0\nCan Prophet Muhammad hear us?\nThe basic principle concerning the dead is that they do not hear the words of the living sons of Adam, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“but you cannot make hear those who are in graves.” [Fatir 35:22]\nAllah confirmed that those whom he (the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)) was calling to Islam could not hear, by likening them to the dead. There is nothing in the Quran or in the authentic Sunnah to indicate that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) can hear every Du`a or call from human beings. Rather it is proven that the only thing that reaches him (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the blessings and Salams of those who send blessings and Salams upon him .\xa0\nThis was narrated by Abu Dawud, 2041, with a sound chain of transmission from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no one who sends Salams upon me but Allah will restore to me my soul so that I may return his Salams.” This does not mean that he hears the words of the one who sends Salams. Rather it is possible that he comes to know of those Salams when the angels convey that to him. If we assume that he hears the words of the one who sends Salams, this is an exception from the general rule, as in the case of the dead hearing the footsteps of those who carry his bier, and as in the case of the slain disbelievers in the well at Badr who heard the call of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when he said to them: “Have you found your Lord’s promise to be true? For we have found our Lord’s promise to be true.” (See Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 1/313, 318, 321)\xa0\nIs calling upon Prophet Muhammad permissible?\nWith regard to calling upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and asking him directly, this is the essence of polytheism which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was sent to forbid and to fight against its people.\xa0\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 111019 , 10289 ,\xa011402 ,\xa0and 1439 .\xa0\nWe ask Allah to bring the Muslims back to the right path. And Allah knows best. May Allah send blessings and peace upon his Prophet Muhammad and his family and Companions.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21524/can-prophet-muhammad-hear-us
226230,"Publishing houses write at the beginning of many of their books words to the effect of “No part of this book may be reproduced or photocopied without written permission from the publisher.” If I find these books published for free on the Internet, and available to anyone who wants to download them, is it permissible to download them and read them?","['Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with downloading e-books published on the Internet, or reading them, because one of the following two scenarios must apply to them:\nThe first scenario:\nThe book has been published with the permission of its author or copyright holder – which applies to many books, praise be to Allah – as the authors of these books and papers want to spread knowledge by electronic means, seeking reward with Allah, may He be exalted.\nThe second scenario:\nThe book has been published without the permission of the copyright holders, but the aim of downloading it and reading it is personal benefit, not commercial publication or to get hold of work done by others in order to alter it and claim it as one’s own work.\nIn that case, the author or publishing house has no right to prevent educated readers and seekers of knowledge from reading and downloading these books that have been published electronically.\nWhat has been issued of statements by Fiqh Councils acknowledging copyright should be understood within the framework of regulating commercial benefits first and foremost and, secondly, preventing the mischief of plagiarism and forgery. It is not intended to completely forbid any form of benefitting from the books, to the extent that some of them regard merely quoting from a book or article and attributing it to the author as a transgression of copyright, unless one has obtained special permission beforehand for this exact quotation.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about the ruling on photocopying books, and he replied:\nWhat we think is that if it is for personal use, there is nothing wrong with it. But if it is for commercial gain, then it is not permissible, because it is detrimental to the publishers’ or authors’ interests.""(Thamarat at-Tadwin\xa0 p.142).\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) also said:\nWhat I think is that if an individual makes a copy for himself only, there is nothing wrong with that. But if he makes copies in order to sell them, this is not permissible, because it is harming others, and it is akin to underselling a fellow Muslim, because if they are selling [a book] for one hundred [riyals], and you make copies and sell it for fifty, this is underselling your brother.""(Liqa’ al-Bab al-Maftuh\xa0178/19).\nHere we are not trying to discuss this complicated issue in detail and list the different scholarly views regarding it in all circumstances and categories. Rather our aim here is to highlight that there is nothing wrong with the seeker of knowledge, educated person or researcher downloading books that he comes across on the Internet. But he should take care with quotations and attribute them to their sources, and he should not make any commercial gain as a result of downloading or publishing it, especially when the two types of reasons mentioned above are mingled in cyberspace, so no one has the right to prohibit what is in principle permissible on the basis of doubt or some unique circumstances.\nPraise be to Allah, the academic and publishing markets have proven that e-publishing is a different market to paper publishing, and one of them does not cancel out the other; rather each of them has its own customers.\nSee also the answers to questions no. 116782 and 81614 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/226230/ruling-on-downloading-e-books-and-making-use-of-them
