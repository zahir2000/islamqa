290009,"I have a question that comes to my mind often, and I cannot find any answer to it. What is the meaning of the hadith which says, “O My slaves, I have forbidden injustice to Myself”? If Allah, may He be exalted, has forbidden injustice to Himself, then why does He not share out provision among people justly? Why has He favoured one group over another? Why are there people who have wealth, knowledge, beauty and everything, and others who do not have anything? Why did Allah, may He be exalted, not give each person everything? In other words, what sin did those people commit to whom Allah, may He be exalted, did not give anything? I want a detailed answer, because doubts about Islam and about Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, keep coming to my mind. Also, is it permissible for me to pray against people who transgress against me in words, who have not reached puberty yet?","[""Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nAllah is far above any injustice\nAllah, may He be glorified, is far above any injustice . He is free of need and almighty, and has no need of His creation, as He, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{O mankind, you are those in need of Allah, while Allah is the Free of need, the Praiseworthy.\nIf He wills, He can do away with you and bring forth a new creation\nAnd that is for Allah not difficult}\xa0[Fatir 35:15-17]\n{Indeed, Allah does not do injustice, [even] as much as an atom's weight; while if there is a good deed, He multiplies it and gives from Himself a great reward}\xa0[an-Nisa’ 4:40].\nIn the famous hadith qudsi, it says: “O My slaves, I have forbidden injustice (zulm) to Myself and I have made it forbidden among you, so do not be unjust towards one another.” Narrated by Muslim (2577).\nIn relation to the greatest creations of Allah, such as the Throne, the Kursiy, the galaxies, the sun and moon, man is no more than a speck of dust or a grain of sand in a vast desert!\nAllah is free of need and has no need whatsoever to be unjust and wrong this speck of dust whom He has blessed with life and granted him hearing and vision, and bestows upon him bounty from His stores.\nHow strange it is, then, that this created being, who is so insignificant, when he forgets his status and the Shaytan deceives him with an idea, would dispute with the Most Gracious about His actions and decree, or when it crosses his mind that Allah, the Most Great, the Most High, Who has bestowed everything upon him, could be unjust towards him.\nFirst of all, you need to know that Allah is mighty, free of need, sovereign, bestower of blessings, most kind, bestower of bounty, most generous, most giving. Whatever good comes to a person, it is Allah Who bestowed it, beginning with the blessing of being brought into existence, and ending with admittance to Paradise and enjoying its delights.\n{And whatever you have of favor - it is from Allah}\xa0[an-Nahl 16:53]\n{And if you should count the favor of Allah , you could not enumerate them. Indeed, mankind is [generally] most unjust and ungrateful}\xa0[Ibrahim 14:34].\nSecondly, you should understand what injustice (zulm) is.\nInjustice is taking from you what you own, or punishing you for no sin, or causing your good deeds to be in vain, or taking them from you and giving them to someone else, or requiting you for your good deeds with Hell.\nAllah is far above all of that.\nNo human can attribute any such thing to Allah.\nAllah has reassured His slaves and has told them that they will not be wronged in the slightest.\n{But he who does of righteous deeds while he is a believer - he will neither fear injustice nor deprivation}\xa0[Ta-Ha 20:112]\n{And fear a Day when you will be returned to Allah . Then every soul will be compensated for what it earned, and they will not be treated unjustly}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:281]\n{And they will confide regret when they see the punishment; and they will be judged in justice, and they will not be wronged}\xa0[Yunus 10:54]\n{And for all there are degrees [of reward and punishment] for what they have done, and [it is] so that He may fully compensate them for their deeds, and they will not be wronged}\xa0[al-Ahqaf 46:19].\nThirdly: you should understand the difference between justice and blessings.\nJustice means that Allah does not treat you unjustly or wrong you. As for blessings, He grants them to whomever He wills.\nThus Allah, may He be glorified, does not wrong His slaves in the slightest, but He is the Possessor of abundant bounty which He bestows upon whomever He wills, and He knows best who is deserving of His bounty, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{But Allah selects for His mercy whom He wills, and Allah is the possessor of great bounty}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:105]\n{Say, “Indeed, [all] bounty is in the hand of Allah - He grants it to whom He wills. And Allah is all-Encompassing and Wise.”\nHe selects for His mercy whom He wills. And Allah is the possessor of great bounty}\xa0[Al ‘Imran 3:73-74]\n{That is the bounty from Allah, and sufficient is Allah as Knower}\xa0[an-Nisa’ 4:70].\nAllah, may He be glorified, sent His Messengers, sent down His Books, and explained His commands and prohibitions. Then whoever He willed believed and whoever He willed disbelieved, and whoever disbelieved, his ultimate fate will be the Fire, and this is His justice.\nAllah, may He be glorified, bestows His bounty upon whomever He wills, so He opens his heart and helps him to be guided, and He makes him steadfast in adhering to the truth. This is His bounty and grace.\nAllah, may He be glorified, enjoined His slaves to strive on earth and seek provision. Some of them work hard and strive, and they succeed and accumulate wealth and riches, and some of them are sluggish and lazy, and are content with poverty and weakness. This is justice.\nAllah, may He be glorified, bestows His bounty on whomever He wills, so He blesses him, makes means available to him, and enables his trade to be profitable or his work to bear fruit. This is His bounty.\nFourthly: you should understand that Allah is the Lord, the All-Knowing, the Most Wise, who is not to be asked about what He does.\nSo it cannot be said to the Lord: Why did You give to So-and-so and not to So-and-so?\nIt cannot be said to the Lord: Why did you create this one beautiful and that one ugly?\nIf the Lord could be questioned, there would be no difference between the Lord and His slave!\nBut reflect on the wisdom of Allah, for He may grant beauty and wealth to someone, but that person then transgresses, so his ultimate fate will be Hell.\nHe may grant beauty and wealth to someone who does not give thanks to Him, so that is a cause of suffering and doom for him.\nOr He may take away beauty and grant guidance, and instil contentment in that person’s heart, thus he becomes one of the happiest of people.\nOr He may grant one person beauty, guidance and happiness, and this is His bounty that he bestows upon whomever He wills.\n{And if Allah had extended [excessively] provision for His servants, they would have committed tyranny throughout the earth. But He sends [it] down in an amount which He wills. Indeed He is, of His servants, Acquainted and Seeing}\xa0[ash-Shura 42:27].\nFifthly: you should understand that the fact that Allah gives to certain people is not because of the high status, virtue or righteousness of the one to whom He gives.\nAnd the fact that He withholds from some people is not because they are insignificant before Him, or because they are evil or corrupt people. Rather it is based on great wisdom which is known to the Most Kind, the All-Aware, and people cannot grasp its essence and secrets.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And as for man, when his Lord tries him and [thus] is generous to him and favors him, he says, “My Lord has honored me.”\nBut when He tries him and restricts his provision, he says, “My Lord has humiliated me.”\nNo!}\xa0[al-Fajr 89:15-17].\n“No!” means the matter is not as you say or as you think, that being blessed with wealth or provision is an honour and that being deprived of that is humiliation. Rather it is because of the great wisdom of the Most Wise, the All-Aware, Who tests thereby whomever He wills of His slaves.\nShaykh as-Sa‘di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nHere Allah (st) tells us of the nature of man as he really is; he is ignorant and a wrongdoer, who does not think of the consequences. He thinks that the situation he finds himself in will last and never change, and he thinks that the generosity of Allah in this world and the blessings that He bestows upon him indicate that he is dear to Allah and close to Him.\n{But when He tries him and restricts his provision } and reduces it to what is just enough, with no surplus, he thinks that Allah is humiliating him thereby. But Allah refutes this notion by saying:\n{ No!} that is, not everyone on whom I bestow abundance in this world is dear to Me, and not everyone whose provision I restrict is insignificant or worthless before Me.\nRather wealth and poverty, restriction and abundance, are a trial with which Allah tests His slaves to see who will give thanks and be patient, so that He may reward him generously for that, and who will not respond in that manner, and will therefore suffer a terrifying punishment.\nMoreover, if a person focuses only on what he himself wants, this is indicative of low aspirations. Therefore Allah criticises them for not paying attention to the situation of needy people… End quote from Tafsir as-Sa‘di (924).\nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 178673 .\nSo ignore these intrusive thoughts, and learn how to love Allah and how to turn to Him, give thanks for His blessings, reflect on His gifts, expect His grace, hope for His His Paradise and long to see Him.\nGive up this ingratitude, rebellious attitude and denial of his blessings, and think instead about the thousands of blessings that He has bestowed upon you, the greatest of which is that He has made you His female slave who prostrates to Him, and you raise your hands to Him [in supplication]. How many people are deprived of this blessing, for they turn to objects of worship other than Him and seek to draw close to deities other than Him.\nYou have been honoured, blessed and favoured over millions of other people, so say: Al-hamdu Lillah (praise be to Allah).\nIn this world, no matter how hard your life is, if you believe in Allah and He admits you to Paradise, you will not remember ever having gone through hardship, so praise Allah.\nNo matter how much you are tried and tested in this world in terms of your health, wealth, or looks, if you bear it with patience, Allah will compensate you for that with that which has never crossed your mind, because He is the Lord, the Most Generous, the Most Merciful. There is no act of worship that His slave does and nothing that he gives up for His sake, or does for His sake, but He will compensate him for that with a vastly multiplied reward.\nSo be steadfast in your faith, turn to your Creator, and keep your eye on the prize of eternal bliss which Allah has promised to His slaves in the hereafter, for the hereafter is true life, and the life of this world is but a temporary convenience.\nAl-Bukhari (6571) and Muslim (186) narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Indeed I know the last of the people of Hell to be brought forth from it, and the last of the people of Paradise to be admitted to it. It will be a man who will emerge crawling from Hell, and Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, will say to him: ‘Go and enter Paradise.’ He will come to it and it will appear to him to be full. He will go back and say, ‘O Lord, I found it full.’ \xa0Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, will say to him: ‘Go and enter Paradise.’ He will go to it and it will appear to him to be full. He will go back and say, ‘O Lord, I found it full.’ Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, will say to him: ‘Go and enter Paradise, and you will have the equivalent of the whole world and ten times as much – or you will have ten times as much as the whole world –.’ He will say, ‘Are You mocking me – or laughing at me – when You are the Sovereign?’” He said: And I saw the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) smile so broadly that his eyeteeth appeared. And it was said: He will be the lowest of the people of Paradise in status.\nAnd Muslim (2807) narrated that Anas ibn Maalik said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The most affluent of the people in this world, of those who will go to Hell, will be brought on the Day of Resurrection and dipped once in the Fire. Then it will be said: ‘O son of Adam, did you ever see anything good? Did you ever have any pleasure?’ He will say: ‘No, by Allah, O Lord.’\nThen the most destitute of the people in this world, of those who will enter Paradise, will be brought and dipped once in Paradise, and it will be said to him: ‘O son of Adam, did you ever see anything bad? Did you ever experience any hardship?’ ‘He will say: No, by Allah, O Lord. I never saw anything bad and I never experienced any hardship.’”\nWe ask Allah to grant you reassurance, guide you, make your faith steadfast, and make you among the righteous women who are devout and give thanks.\nSecondly:\nIs it permissible to pray against an aggressor?\nYou should not pray against anyone, especially minors who have not yet reached the age of puberty. It is better to show them kindness and try to win them over, and to set a good example for them. Then if they cause you annoyance, be patient, as was the advice of Luqman:\n{O my son, establish prayer, enjoin what is right, forbid what is wrong, and be patient over what befalls you. Indeed, [all] that is of the matters [requiring] determination}\xa0[Luqman 31:17].\nControl your tongue and only speak good words. When you offer supplication, pray for them to be guided to righteousness, such as saying: May Allah guide you, may Allah rectify your condition.\nAs for praying against an aggressor, a person may overstep the mark and go beyond what is within his rights to say, in which case he himself will become an aggressor and wrongdoer.\nHis supplication may be answered, and something bad may happen to the one against whom he prayed, thus causing him pain and sorrow.\nBut if you must do that, then say: O Allah, suffice me against their evil; O Allah, avert their harm from me… and the like.\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/290009/a-response-to-the-specious-argument-that-if-allah-is-not-unjust-why-do-people-vary-so-much-and-the-provision-of-blessings-that-they-have
400709,"I heard a shaykh say that if it was possible for us to see Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, there would be no test. Thus we may understand His words (interpretation of the meaning): {… who believe in the unseen} [al-Baqarah 2:3]. As we cannot see Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, this is the test. For the person who is not certain of himself, whether he is really a believer or has true faith, is that part of his test? Meaning, for example, Sayyiduna ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) used to ask Hudhayfah (may Allah be pleased with him): am I a hypocrite? What I mean, for example, is that Imam So-and-so used to say: Every time I think to myself that I am showing off, I do more of that particular good deed, and one of the Tabi‘in said: I met a group of the Sahabah, and none of them denied the possibility that he could be a hypocrite. My question is: is this normal? Is it true that no one can be certain that he is a believer?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nWhat is meant by belief in the unseen (al-ghayb)\nUndoubtedly belief in the unseen is the test of a person’s faith.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Alif, Lam, Meem.\nThis is the Book about which there is no doubt, a guidance for those conscious of Allah,\nWho believe in the unseen, establish prayer, and spend out of what We have provided for them}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:1-3].\nThe unseen includes everything that people cannot grasp with their senses. Here it refers to everything of which the Revelation has told us, what happened in the past and what exists now but is hidden from us, such as the world of the angels, al-barzakh, and what will happen in the future, such as the Day of Resurrection, and what will happen on that Day of the reckoning, punishment and bliss.\nSo the unseen has to do with the fundamentals of faith.\nAl-Wahidi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe word {… the unseen} refers to that which is hidden from you, so you cannot see it, thus it is unseen. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {[He is] Knower of the unseen and the seen} [al-An ‘am 6:73]. The Arabs call low-lying land al-ghayb because it cannot be seen…\nAbu’l-‘Aliyah said regarding the verse {… who believe in the unseen}: They believe in Allah, His angels, His Books, His Messengers, the Last Day, His Paradise, His Fire, the meeting with Him, and the resurrection after death.\nIt is as if this is a summary of what is explained in more detail in the verse in which He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{All of them have believed in Allah and His angels and His books and His messengers, [saying], “We make no distinction between any of His messengers.” And they say, “We hear and we obey. [We seek] Your forgiveness, our Lord, and to You is the [final] destination.”}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:285].\nAbu Ishaq said: Everything that is hidden from them of what the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) told them is unseen.\nThis is the way in which the commentators explain the meaning of al-ghayb (the unseen).""(Al-Basit\xa0 2/68-71).\nAl-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThis is the prescribed belief referred to in the hadith of Jibril (peace be upon him), in which he said to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): Tell me about faith (iman). He said: “It is to believe in Allah, His angels, His Books, His Messengers, and the Last Day, and to believe in the divine decree, both good and bad.” He said: You have spoken the truth.""(Tafsir al-Qurtubi\xa0 1/252).\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe basis of faith is belief in the unseen, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Alif, Lam, Meem.\nThis is the Book about which there is no doubt, a guidance for those conscious of Allah,\nWho believe in the unseen, establish prayer, and spend out of what We have provided for them}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:1-3].\nThe unseen in which one must believe is what the Messengers have told us of general aspects of belief, which include believing in Allah and His names and attributes, and in the angels and in Paradise and Hell. Believing in Allah, His Messengers and the Last Day includes believing in the unseen, for the message itself is a matter of the unseen, and the details of that include belief in Allah, His angels, His Books, His Messengers and the Last Day, as Allah, may He be exalted, mentions in the verses (interpretation of the meaning):\n{but [true] righteousness is [in] one who believes in Allah, the Last Day, the angels, the Book, and the prophets}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:177]\n{And whoever disbelieves in Allah, His angels, His books, His messengers, and the Last Day has certainly gone far astray}\xa0[an-Nisa’ 4:136].\nEnd quote from Majmu‘ al-Fatawa (13/232-233).\nBelief in the unseen is the test which makes the one who truly believes stand out from the one who is doubtful.\nShaykh ‘Abd ar-Rahman as-Sa‘di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nHe says: {who believe in the unseen}. The true meaning of belief or faith is complete affirmation of what the Messengers taught; this also includes physical actions. It does not refer to believing in things that are visible or may be known through any of the physical senses, because in that regard there is no difference between the Muslim and the disbeliever. Rather the issue here is belief in the unseen, which we cannot see or know through any of the physical senses; rather we believe in it because Allah and His Messenger have told us of it. This faith is what distinguishes the Muslim from the disbeliever, because it is believing and affirming, with no hesitation, what Allah and His Messenger said. So the believer believes everything that Allah or His messenger have told him, whether he sees it or not and whether he understands it and comprehends it or not.\nThis is in contrast to the heretics and those who disbelieve in the unseen, because their limited intellects could not grasp it, so they rejected what they could not comprehend. Thus their intellect was corrupted and their thinking was flawed, whilst the thinking of the believers, who were guided by Allah, was sound.\nBelief in the unseen includes belief in everything that Allah and His messengers [[<< brought forward in our transl.]]]] have told us about unseen matters in the past and in the future, events of the hereafter and the reality of the divine attributes and their essence. So they believe in the attributes of Allah in a true sense and with certain faith, even if they do not understand their essence.""(Tafsir as-Sa‘di\xa0p. 40-41).\nSo the one who believes in what the Messengers have told us of matters that he has not seen is the sincere believer whose faith is proven to be sound.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{The believers are only the ones who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and then doubt not but strive with their wealth and their lives in the cause of Allah. It is those who are the truthful}\xa0[al-Hujurat 49:15].\nAs for the disbelievers, many of them are certain that their Messengers never lied, but they deny the unseen, and they give excuses for that. Then when they see the Angel of death with their own eyes and they see the hereafter, their belief will not benefit them in that situation, because it is faith by compulsion and is not sincere belief. Hence if they were to be sent back to this world, they would go back to disbelief.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{If you could but see when they are made to stand before the Fire and will say, “Oh, would that we could be returned [to life on earth] and not deny the signs of our Lord and be among the believers.”\nBut what they concealed before has [now] appeared to them. And even if they were returned, they would return to that which they were forbidden; and indeed, they are liars.\nAnd they say, “There is none but our worldly life, and we will not be resurrected.”}\xa0[al-An‘am 6:27-29].\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhat is meant by saying {But what they concealed before has [now] appeared to them} is that they will not ask to return to this world out of love for faith; rather it will be out of fear of the punishment that they have seen with their own eyes, as a requital for their disbelief. Hence they will ask to go back to the dunya so as to be safe from what they have seen of the Fire. Therefore Allah says: {And even if they were returned, they would return to that which they were forbidden; and indeed, they are liars}. In other words, they are lying when they claim that they wish to return to this world because they want to be believers.\nThen Allah tells us that if they were returned to this world, they would go back to what was forbidden to them of disbelief and disobedience: {and indeed, they are liars} when they say {“Oh, would that we could be returned [to life on earth] and not deny the signs of our Lord and be among the believers”} and {“There is none but our worldly life, and we will not be resurrected”}. In other words, they would go back to what was forbidden to them, and they are indeed lying when they say {There is none but our worldly life”}, meaning that there is nothing but the life of this world, and there is no resurrection after that. Hence they said {“and we will not be resurrected”}.""(Tafsir Ibn Kathir\xa0 3/249).\nThis does not mean that there is no benefit in seeing the unseen; rather it is beneficial for those with sound hearts who desire and love faith, as seeing it will increase in faith and certainty.\nWe see this in the story of Ibrahim (peace be upon him), as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation and meaning):\n{And [mention] when Abraham said, “My Lord, show me how You give life to the dead.” [Allah] said, “Have you not believed?” He said, “Yes, but [I ask] only that my heart may be satisfied.” [Allah] said, “Take four birds and commit them to yourself. Then [after slaughtering them] put on each hill a portion of them; then call them - they will come [flying] to you in haste. And know that Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise”}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:260].\nThis is also referred to in the hadith of Abu Hurayrah who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has angels who travel about seeking out the people of dhikr. When they find people remembering Allah, they call out to one another: ‘Come to what you were seeking.’ Then they encircle them with their wings up to the first heaven. Then their Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, who has greater knowledge than them, asks them: ‘What are My slaves saying?’ They say: ‘They are glorifying You, magnifying You, praising You and extolling You.’ He says: ‘Have they seen Me?’ They say: ‘No, By Allah, they have not seen You.’ He says: ‘And how would it be if they saw Me?’ They say: ‘If they saw You, they would worship You more fervently, and extol and praise You more fervently, and would glorify You more.’ He says: ‘What are they asking of Me?’ They say: ‘They are asking You for Your Paradise.’ He says: ‘Have they seen it?’ They say: No, by Allah O Lord, they have not seen it.’ He says: ‘And what if they saw My Paradise?’ They say: ‘If they saw it, they would be even keener to attain it and would seek it more fervently and desire it more greatly.’ He says: ‘From what are they seeking My protection?’ They say: ‘From the Fire.’ He says: ‘Have they seen it?’ They say: ‘No, by Allah O Lord, they have not seen it.’ He says: ‘And what if they saw it?’ They say: ‘If they saw it, they would be even keener to flee from it, and would fear it more greatly. He says: ‘You are My witnesses that I have forgiven them.’ One of the angels says: ‘Among them is So-and-so, who is not one of them; rather he came on some errand.’ He says: ‘This is a gathering which no one who joins them can be doomed.’” Narrated by al-Bukhari (6408) and Muslim (2689).\nThis indicates that if they saw Allah, may He be exalted, and they saw Paradise and Hell, that would benefit them by increasing their faith and belief.\nThe belief of the Muslims nowadays in the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is a kind of belief in the unseen. Those who did see him, namely the Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them), benefitted in terms of their faith.\nSa‘id ibn Mansur narrated with an isnad of which the narrators are trustworthy, as noted in at-Tafsir min Sunan Sa‘id ibn Mansur (2/544): Abu Mu‘awiyah told us, from al-A‘mash, from ‘Umarah ibn ‘Umayr, from ‘Abd ar-Rahman ibn Yazid, from ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud, who said: They were talking about the Companions of Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and how strong their faith was, then ‘Abdullah said: The matter of Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was very clear to those who saw him. By the One besides Whom there is no god worthy of worship, there is nothing better for the believer than believing in the unseen. Then he recited:\n{Alif, Lam, Meem.\nThis is the Book about which there is no doubt, a guidance for those conscious of Allah,\nWho believe in the unseen, establish prayer, and spend out of what We have provided for them}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:1-3].\nIbn al-Jawzi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThere are six views regarding what is meant by the unseen… 6. That it is believing in the Messenger, for one who has not seen him. ‘Amr ibn Murrah said: The companions of ‘Abdullah said to him: How fortunate you are! You strove in jihad with the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and sat with him. He said: The matter of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was very clear to those who saw him. Rather what is more amazing than that is people who see a book [the Qur’an] and believe in him, even though they did not see him. Then he recited, {… who believe in the unseen}.""(Zad al-Masir\xa0 1/24-25).\nSecondly:\nNot knowing one’s status before Allah has nothing to do with belief in the unseen\nFrom the above, it is clear that if a person does not know his status before Allah, may He be exalted, that has nothing to do with the issue of belief in the unseen which Allah has enjoined upon us and for which He will bring us to account.\nRather that comes under the prohibition on speculating about matters of the unseen and speaking without knowledge. For no one knows to what extent Allah, may He be exalted, will accept his deeds or what his end will be; therefore no one has the right to praise himself. At the same time, he should not despair of the mercy and kindness of Allah, may He be exalted, so he should always be in a state between hope and fear.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Call upon your Lord in humility and privately; indeed, He does not like transgressors.\nAnd cause not corruption upon the earth after its reformation. And invoke Him in fear and hope. Indeed, the mercy of Allah is near to the doers of good}\xa0[al-A‘raf 7:55-56].\nShaykh ‘Abd ar-Rahman as-Sa‘di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n{And invoke Him in fear and hope} that is, that is, fear of His punishment and hope of His reward, hoping that one’s deeds will be accepted and fearing that they will be rejected, not offering supplication in the manner of one who thinks that he is entitled to a response from his Lord, filled with self-admiration and raising himself above his station, or in the manner of one who is heedless and not focusing.""(Tafsir as-Sa‘di\xa0 p. 292).\nOne example of this fear of Allah and of His punishment is the Sahabah’s fear of falling into hypocrisy. Therefore they did not praise themselves and they were not certain that their good deeds were accepted; rather they feared that they may have committed some infractions that could lead to hypocrisy without them realising, so they did not claim to be infallible.\nIn his Sahih, al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) included a chapter entitled Chapter on the believer’s fear that his deeds may be rendered worthless without him realising.\nIn this chapter he quoted the following:\nIbrahim at-Taymi said: I never compared my words with my deeds but I feared that I could be a disbeliever. Ibn Abi Mulaykah said: I met thirty of the Companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and all of them feared that they might be hypocrites; not one of them said that he had attained the level of faith of Jibril and Mika’il. And it was narrated from al-Hasan [that he said]: No one fears Allah accept a believer and no one feels secure from His punishment except a hypocrite.""(Fath al-Bari\xa0 1/109-110).\nIbn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe reason for that may boil down to what is mentioned above, that hypocrisy has minor and major forms. Minor hypocrisy is hypocrisy in actions; this is what these people feared for themselves and it is what leads to major hypocrisy. So there is the fear that if someone is overwhelmed by the characteristics of minor hypocrisy during his lifetime, that may lead to major hypocrisy, to the extent that he will no longer be a believer at all, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And when they deviated, Allah caused their hearts to deviate}\xa0[as-Saff 61:5]\n{And We will turn away their hearts and their eyes just as they refused to believe in it the first time. And We will leave them in their transgression, wandering blindly}\xa0[al-An‘am 6:110].""(Fath al-Bari\xa0 1/195).\nTherefore it is permissible to say “in sha Allah” in the context of faith, meaning that the Muslim may say, “I am a believer, in sha Allah.” What is meant is that part of faith is actions, and the one who does what is obligatory and refrains from what is prohibited, would fear that he may have fallen short, and would not claim that he has perfect faith, because he cannot be certain about that.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWith regard to the view of the early hadith scholars – such as Ibn Mas‘ud and his companions, ath-Thawri, Ibn ‘Uyaynah, most of the scholars of Kufah, Yahya ibn Sa‘id al-Qattan in what he narrated from the scholars of Basrah, Ahmad ibn Hanbal and other leading Sunni scholars – all of them would say “in sha Allah” when asked about faith…\nIn fact, these leading scholars clearly stated that the reason why one should say “in sha Allah” is because faith includes doing obligatory duties, so they could not testify that they had perfect faith, just as they could not testify that they were righteous and pious. For that is something of which they could not be certain, and it would be like praising themselves without being certain whether they are deserving of that.""(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa\xa0 7/438-439).\nAnd he (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nFaith in general includes doing everything that Allah has enjoined upon His slave and refraining from everything that He has prohibited. So if a man says, “I have faith in that sense,” then he is testifying that he is one of the righteous and pious who do all that they are commanded to do and refrain from all that they are forbidden to do. In that case, he will be one of the close friends (awliya’) of Allah. This comes under the heading of praising oneself and testifying concerning oneself regarding something of which one cannot be certain. If this testimony is true, then he should testify that he will be one of the people of Paradise if he dies in that state, and no one can testify that he will be one of the people of Paradise. Thus his testifying that he has faith is like his testifying that he will be one of the people of Paradise if he dies in that state. This is the approach of the early scholars who would say “in sha Allah” when they stated that they had faith. However, they may have regarded it as permissible to not say “in sha Allah” after stating that one has faith in a different sense, as we shall discuss below, in sha Allah.""(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa 7/446).\nBut this does not mean that the Muslim should not say definitively that he believes in Islam in principle; rather he must state that definitively and he should have no doubt in his heart that he believes in Allah, may He be exalted, and His angels, His Books, His Messengers, the Last Day, and the divine decree, both good and bad.\nIbn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAhmad and others of the early generations stated it definitively and did not doubt that they had faith in that sense. They would say “in sha Allah” with regard to faith in the general sense, which includes doing what is enjoined.""(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa\xa0 7/450).\nIbn Abi’l-‘Izz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAs for those who say that it is permissible to say “in sha Allah” or not to say it, they have better evidence than the other two groups, and the middle path is the best. They say that if the one who says “in sha Allah” means that he has doubts about the foundation of his faith, he should be told not to say “in sha Allah.” This is a matter concerning which there is no difference of scholarly opinion.\nBut if he means that he is one of the believers whom Allah describes in the verses (interpretation of the meaning):\n{The believers are only those who, when Allah is mentioned, their hearts become fearful, and when His verses are recited to them, it increases them in faith; and upon their Lord they rely,\nThe ones who establish prayer, and from what We have provided them, they spend.\nThose are the believers, truly. For them are degrees [of high position] with their Lord and forgiveness and noble provision}\xa0[al-Anfal 8:2-4]\n{The believers are only the ones who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and then doubt not but strive with their wealth and their lives in the cause of Allah . It is those who are the truthful}\xa0[al-Hujurat 49:15],\nthen in that case, saying “in sha Allah” is permissible.""(Sharh at-Tahhaawiyyah\xa0p. 353).\nThirdly:\nFear of hypocrisy\nThe praiseworthy type of fear of hypocrisy is that fear which motivates one to strive harder in doing righteous deeds. If a person fears showing off whilst he is doing an act of worship, then let his fear be the type that motivates the worshipper to strive against showing off whilst continuing with his worship and doing more of it. It should not be the type of fear that makes him give up on worship and turn away from it for fear of showing off.\nThis has been discussed previously in the answer to question no. 21880 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/400709/what-is-belief-in-the-unseen-and-how-important-is-it
112165,"Every Friday, in the last hour before sunset, which is expected to be the hour of response, when Allah responds to supplications, I make sure to go to the mosque and pray two rak‘ahs to Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, to greet the mosque, then in the last prostration of the two rak‘ahs, I remain in prostration until sunset, offering supplication in my prostration, until the adhan is given for Maghrib, because this is a time of opportunity, the last hour on Friday when a response to supplication is more likely, and I want to increase the likelihood of a response when I am prostrating. Sometimes, if there is no reason to pray and it is a time when prayer is not allowed, I deliberately recite a surah in which there is a prostration, then I prostrate for an hour, until the adhan is given for Maghrib on Friday. I used to offer supplication and prostrate for a long time, until someone came to me one day after I got up and made me doubt what I had been doing, and he hinted to me that it is an innovation (bid‘ah). Is it really an innovation? Even though my intention is to offer supplication during the time of response, which is the last hour of Friday. I pray when I am prostrating, combining two opportunities in which a response is likely, and this is basically my intention.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe scholars differed regarding the definition of the hour of response on Friday, and there are many views. The strongest of these views in terms of evidence are that it is the time between the adhan of Jumu‘ah and the end of Jumu‘ah prayer, and that it is the time after ‘Asr until the sun sets. There is evidence in the Sunnah for both of these times, and there are scholars who support each of them.\nA.\xa0The evidence for the first view is the hadith of Abu Musa al-Ash‘ari (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say – regarding the hour on Friday –: “It is the time between the moment when the imam sits down [on the minbar] until the [Jumu‘ah] prayer ends.” Narrated by Muslim (853).\nThe scholars who hold this view are many. Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe early generations differed as to which of the two views is more likely to be correct. Al-Bayhaqi narrated via Abu’l-Fadl Ahmad ibn Salamah an-Nisaburi that Muslim said: The hadith of Abu Musa is the best and most sound hadith regarding this matter. This was also the view of al-Bayhaqi, Ibn al-‘Arabi and a number of others. Al-Qurtubi said: This is a clear text regarding an issue concerning which the scholars differed, so no attention should be paid to anything else. An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is the only sound view, and it is stated definitively in ar-Rawdah that it is the correct view. It is also deemed more likely to be correct because it is attributed directly to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and is clear, and is found in one of the two Sahihs.""(Fath al-Bari\xa0 2/421).\nB.\xa0With regard to the evidence for the second view, it is the hadith of Jabir ibn ‘Abdillah (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Friday is twelve hours, in which there is no Muslim who asks Allah for something but He will grant him it, so seek it in the last hour after ‘Asr.” Narrated by Abu Dawud (1048) and an-Nasa’i (1389). Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud and by an-Nawawi in al-Majmu‘ (4/471).\nThe scholars who hold this view are also many; foremost among them are the two Companions Abu Hurayrah and ‘Abdullah ibn Salam (may Allah be pleased with them both).\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajr (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nOthers are of the view that the report of ‘Abdullah ibn Salam is more likely to be correct. At-Tirmidhi narrated from Ahmad that he said: Most of the hadiths support that. Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said: It is the soundest view regarding this matter. Sa‘id ibn Mansur narrated with a sahih isnad going back to Abu Salamah ibn ‘Abd ar-Rahman that some of the Sahabah met and discussed the hour on Friday, then they parted and did not disagree on the view that it is the last hour on Friday. Many of the leading scholars also thought that this was most likely to be correct, such as Ahmad and Ishaq and, among the Malikis, at-Tartushi. Al-‘Ala’i narrated that his shaykh, Ibn az-Zamalkani – the shaykh of the Shafa‘is at that time – favoured this view, and narrated it based on a statement of ash-Shafa‘i.""(Fath al-Bari\xa0 2/421).\nThere is the hope that each of these two hours is a time when supplications are answered.\nImam Ahmad said: Most of the hadiths about the hour [on Friday] during which there is the hope that supplications will be answered say that it is after ‘Asr prayer, and it is to be sought starting from after the sun has passed the meridian. This was narrated from him by at-Tirmidhi.\nSunan at-Tirmidhi (2/360).\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIn my view, the hour of the [Jumu‘ah] prayer is also an hour in which there is the hope that supplications will be answered. Both of them are times when there is the hope of response, even though the specific hour in that regard is the last hour after ‘Asr, because it is a specific hour of the day and cannot be brought forward or put back. As for the hour of the prayer, it is connected to the prayer, whether the prayer is brought forward or delayed, because the gathering of the Muslims, their prayer, and their beseeching and supplicating Allah, may He be exalted, all have an impact in bringing a response, so the hour of their gathering is an hour in which there is the hope that their supplications will be answered.\nAll the hadiths are agreed on that, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) urged his ummah to offer supplication and beseech Allah, may He be exalted, at these two times.""(Zad al-Ma‘ad\xa0 1/394).\nShaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIn some of the reports narrated by Muslim it says that it is “when the imam sits down on the minbar on Friday, until the prayer ends.” This is how it is narrated in Sahih Muslim from Abu Musa in a marfu‘ hadith (directly attributed to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)). Some of the scholars critiqued this report by saying that these are the words of Abu Burdah ibn Abi Musa and they are not to be attributed to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). However, the correct view is that they are proven to be the Prophet’s words. It is also mentioned in the hadiths narrated from Jabir ibn ‘Abdillah and ‘Abdullah ibn Salam that it is between ‘Asr prayer and sunset. It says in some hadiths that it is the last hour of Friday. All of these reports are sound and there is no contradiction between them. What is most likely, and what gives the greatest hope of a response, is that it is from when the imam sits down on the minbar until the end of the prayer, and from after ‘Asr prayer until sunset. These are the times that are most likely to be the hour of response, and regarding the other times on Friday, there is hope that all of them may be a time when supplications are answered, but the most likely times are from when the imam sits down on the minbar until the end of the prayer, and from after ‘Asr prayer until sunset. These are the times that are most likely to be the hour of response, and regarding the other times on Friday, there is hope that all of them may be a time when supplications are answered, because of the general meaning of some of the hadiths which speak of that. So the Muslim should offer a great deal of supplication on Friday, in the hope that it will coincide with this blessed hour, but he should pay more attention to the three times mentioned above, because the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) stated that that is the hour of response.""(Fatawa ash-Shaykh Ibn Baz\xa0 12/401, 402).\nShaykh Muhammad ibn Salih al-‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe hour on Friday in which there is the greatest hope of a response to supplication is the time of the prayer, for several reasons:\n1.\xa0Because that is mentioned in Sahih Muslim, in the hadith of Abu Musa al-Ash‘ari (may Allah be pleased with him).\n2.\xa0Because this gathering of the Muslims to perform one act of worship behind one leader, namely one imam, is the gathering in which a response to supplication is most likely. Hence on the day of ‘Arafah when the Muslims gather in the plain of ‘Arafah, Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, descends to the lowest heaven; He boasts of them to the angels and answers their supplications. Hence you should be keen to offer supplication at this time, which is the time of Jumu‘ah prayer. But when does this hour begin and when does it end? It begins when the imam enters the mosque and lasts until prayer ends. So now let us look at when we should offer supplication. The imam enters the mosque and greets the people with salaam, after which comes the adhan. There is no supplication during the adhan, because one should respond to the mu’adhdhin [by repeating what he says]. After the adhan there is supplication, and between the adhan and the khutbah there is supplication. You should say after the adhan: “Allahumma Rabba hadhihi’d-da‘wat it-tammah wa’s-salat il-qa’imah, ati Muhammadan il-wasilata wa’l-fadilah, wab‘athhu Allahumma maqaman mahmudan illadhi wa‘adtah innaka la tukhlif ul-mi‘ad (O Allah, Lord of this perfect call and the prayer to be offered, grant Muhammad the privilege (of intercession) and also the eminence, and resurrect him, O Allah, to the praised position that You have promised, for You do not break Your promise).” Then you may offer whatever supplication you wish, so long as the khatib has not started the khutbah; you have an opportunity, so call upon Allah and ask for whatever you wish. Similarly, between the two khutbahs, you may offer whatever supplication you wish, asking Allah for the best of this world and the hereafter. And you may do the same during the prayer, when prostrating, because “The closest a person is to his Lord is when he is prostrating,” as it was soundly narrated from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that the closest you can be to the Lord is when you are prostrating.\nBut there is a another time for offering supplication during the prayer, which is after the tashahhud, as is mentioned in the hadith of Ibn Mas‘ud, in which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) mentioned the tashahhud, then said: “Then let him choose whatever supplication he wishes.” According to the scholars of usul, the phrase “whatever he wishes” is general in meaning.\nNow we have a time when supplications are answered, which is the time of Jumu‘ah prayer, so make the most of this opportunity by offering supplication during Jumu‘ah prayer, in the hope that it will coincide with the “hour of response.”\nThere is also another time, on the same day, when there is the hope that supplications will be answered. It is from after ‘Asr until the sun sets, but some of the scholars had some reservations about this view, noting that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “and he stands and prays,” but after ‘Asr there is no prayer. Other scholars responded by saying that the one who is waiting for the prayer is like one who is praying, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him said: “[A person] is in a state of prayer so long as he is waiting for the prayer.”""(Durus wa Fatawa al-Haram al-Madani, 1416 AH).\nRegarding the Prophet’s words, “and he stands and prays” when the time after ‘Asr is not a time for prayer, there are two possible meanings for these words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) “and he stands and prays”:\na.\xa0It may be that what is meant is sitting and waiting for the prayer, which according to Islamic teachings is regarded as being in a state of prayer.\nAbu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I said to him– i.e., to ‘Abdullah ibn Salam – Tell me about it. ‘Abdullah ibn Salam said: It is the last hour on Friday. I said: How can it be the last hour of Friday when the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No Muslim happens to pray at that time,” but there is no prayer at that time. ‘Abdullah ibn Salam said: Didn’t the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “Whoever sits waiting for the prayer is in a state of prayer until he prays”? I said: Yes. He said: Then that is the answer.\nNarrated by at-Tirmidhi (491), Abu Dawud (1046) and an-Nasa’i (1430); classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud.\nb.\xa0Or it may be that what is meant is offering supplication, because salah (prayer) in Arabic may also refer to du‘a’ (supplication).\nBadr ad-Din al-‘Ayni (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThis indicates that what is meant by prayer (salah) is supplication (du ‘a’), and what is meant by standing is persisting, not actually standing upright.""(‘Umdat al-Qari Sharh al-Bukhari\xa0 6/242).\nSo what is meant by “and he stands and prays” is when he is persisting in offering supplication.\nSo for the one who wants to seek the time when supplications are answered after ‘Asr on Friday, there are several ways of doing that, including the following:\n1.\xa0Remaining in the mosque after ‘Asr prayer and not leaving it, and offering supplication. That is especially important in the last hour after ‘Asr, and this is the highest in status.\nWhen Sa‘id ibn Jubayr had prayed ‘Asr, he would not speak to anyone until the sun set.\n2.\xa0Going to the mosque some time before Maghrib, then praying two rak‘ahs to greet the mosque (tahiyyat al-masjid) and offering supplication until the last hour of ‘Asr time. This is medium in status.\n3.\xa0Sitting in some place – in his house or elsewhere – calling upon his Lord, may He be exalted, during the last hour of ‘Asr time. This is the lowest in status.\nShaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\nIf someone wants to catch up with the last hour of Friday to offer supplication and ask of Allah, does he have to remain in the place in which he prayed ‘Asr, or could he be at home or in another mosque?\nHe replied:\nWhat appears to be the case is that the hadiths are general in meaning, and that if someone offers supplication during the “time of response”, there is the hope that his supplication will be answered in the last hour of Friday. There is the hope that his supplication will be answered, but if he is waiting for the prayer in the mosque in which he intends to pray Maghrib, the hope is greater, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “and he stands and prays” – narrated by al-Bukhari – and the one who is waiting for the prayer is like one who is praying. If he is in a state of prayer, there is greater hope of receiving a response, because the one who is waiting for the prayer is like one who is praying. But if he is sick and he does that in his house, there is nothing wrong with that, or if a woman is in her house and she sits waiting to pray Maghrib in her prayer place, or the sick person sits in his prayer place and offer supplication in the afternoon of Friday, there is the hope of a response. This is what is prescribed, if someone wants to offer supplication, he may go early to the mosque in which he intends to pray Maghrib and sit, waiting for the prayer and offering supplication.""(Fatawa Ibn Baz\xa0 30/270, 271).\nBased on that, what you are doing is wrong on two counts:\na.\xa0Your thinking that the prayer referred to in the hadith is prayer (salah) with bowing and prostrating. Rather what is meant is waiting for the prayer or persisting in offering supplication, as noted above.\nb.\xa0Making the second prostration in the two rak‘ahs to greet the mosque lengthy is contrary to the practice of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in his prayer. His practice when praying was to make the actions of the prayer almost equal in length. In the answer to question no. 111889, we explained that making the last prostration in the prayer lengthy for the purpose of offering supplication is contrary to the practice of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/112165/detailed-discussion-on-the-hour-of-response-on-friday-and-the-ruling-on-making-the-last-prostration-lengthy-for-the-purpose-of-supplication-dua
