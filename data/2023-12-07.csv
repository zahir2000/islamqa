274076,Is Masjid al-Qiblatayn (the Mosque of the Two Qiblahs) the mosque in which the Sahabah turned around whilst praying when someone told them about the change of the qiblah? Or is it called thus because the verses about the change of the qiblah were revealed to the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in it?,"['Praise be to Allah.This incident happened in more than one of the mosques of Madinah at that time, yet despite that the mosques were not called by this name.\nThe Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) turned around to face towards the Ka‘bah whilst they were praying in Masjid Quba’, as is proven in the hadith of Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him).\nThey also turned around whilst they were praying in the masjid of Banu Harithah, as was mentioned in the hadith of al-Bara’ ibn ‘Azib (may Allah be pleased with him).\nWhat was mentioned by the biographers about Masjid al-Qiblatayn and the reason for its name has to do with the masjid of Banu Salamah. It was said that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) visited Umm Bishr, and the time came for Zuhr prayer. Whilst he was praying, he was commanded to face towards the Ka‘bah, so he turned around. The scholars and commentators attribute this report to Tabaqat Ibn Sa‘d.\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe reports differ concerning the prayer during which the qiblah was changed, and the mosque in which that happened…\nMuhammad ibn Sa‘d said in al-Tabaqat: It was said that he had led the Muslims in praying two rak‘ahs of Zuhr in his mosque, then he was commanded to face towards al-Masjid al-Haram, so he turned around to face it and the Muslims turned around with him.\nIt was also said that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) visited Umm Bishr ibn al-Bara’ ibn Ma‘rur in Bani Salamah, and she made some food for him. The time for Zuhr came, so the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) led his companions in praying two rak‘ahs, then he was commanded to turn around to face the Ka‘bah, so he turned to face towards it. Hence that place was named Masjid al-Qiblatayn.\nIbn Sa‘d said: al-Waqidi said: This is more sound in our view.""(Fath al-Bari\xa0 2/116).\nThis was also narrated in al-Tabaqat al-Kubra (1/241).\nIbn Kathir said:\nMore than one of the commentators and others stated that the change of the qiblah was revealed to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) when he had prayed two rak‘ahs of Zuhr. That happened in the mosque of Banu Salamah, which became known as Masjid al-Qiblatayn.\nIn the hadith of Nuwaylah bint Muslim, it says that news of that reached them when they were praying Zuhr, so the men moved to the women’s place and the women moved to the men’s place. This was quoted by Shaykh Abu ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-Barr al-Nimri.\nWith regard to the people of Quba’, the news did not reach them until the time of Fajr prayer on the following day, as it was narrated in al-Sahihayn from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both) that he said: Whilst the people in Quba’ were praying Fajr, someone came to them and said: ‘Last night Qur’an came down to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and he was instructed to face towards the Ka‘bah, so turn around to face towards it.’ They were facing towards al -Sham (Greater Syria), then they turned around to face towards the Ka‘bah.""(Tafsir Ibn Kathir\xa0 1/237).\nThis hadith – as is clear – was quoted by Ibn Sa‘d without any isnad, and he quoted it with wording which indicates that there is some doubt and that he was not certain of its soundness, as he said: “It was said… it was said.” Such a report cannot be relied on and there can be no certainty that it is sound.\nBut these are historical reports and no action is based on them. But there is nothing wrong with narrating them by way of telling the story, not by way of affirming its soundness.\nIt is not recommended for the visitor to Madinah to go and visit any of these places in Madinah and its environs, whether the hadith about the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) praying there is sound or not.\nPlease see also the answer to question no. 11669 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/274076/he-is-asking-about-masjid-al-qiblatayn-and-the-reason-for-its-name
69789,"May Allah reward you for your efforts. In the time of our Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), how did the Muslims distinguish themselves from the disbelievers in their dressing? Did the disbelievers of Mecca also wear long robes (commonly known today as kurtas, jallabias etc.)? So can the wearing of the loose robe be considered as an Islamic dress code?","[""Praise be to Allah.Islamic dress code\nClothing is one of the blessings that Allah has bestowed upon His slaves. It covers the `Awrah and protects against heat and cold. Allah has bestowed this blessing upon them as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“O Children of Adam! We have bestowed raiment upon you to cover yourselves (screen your private parts) and as an adornment; and the raiment of righteousness, that is better. Such are among the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of Allah, that they may remember.” [Al-A`raf 7:26]\xa0\n“… and has made for you garments to protect you from the heat (and cold), and coats of mail to protect you from your (mutual) violence. Thus does He perfect His Favour unto you, that you may submit yourselves to His Will (in Islam).”\xa0[An-Nahl 16:81]\nThe basic principle concerning garments is that they are permissible, and the Muslim may wear whatever he wants of things that he has made or that Muslims or others have made for him. This is what the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) did in Makkah and elsewhere. Those who became Muslim did not wear special garments that were just for them.\xa0\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) wore Syrian garments and Yemeni cloaks, and the people who made them were not Muslims. What matters is that the garment should meet the conditions stipulated by Shari`ah .\xa0\nProhibition to imitate the disbelievers\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade resembling the disbelievers in general – in clothing and in other ways. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever imitates a people is one of them .” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 4031; classed as authentic by Al-`Iraqi in Takhrij Ihya’ `Ulum Ad-Din (1/342) and by Al-Albani in Irwa’ Al-Ghalil, 5/109.)\xa0\nWhat clothes are prohibited in Islam?\nThe Prophet also specifically forbade resembling them in clothing. `Abdullah ibn `Amr ibn Al-`As (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw him wearing two garments dyed with safflower and he said to him: “These are the garments of the disbelievers; do not wear them.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2077)\xa0\nMuslim (2069) narrated from `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that he wrote to the Muslims in Azerbaijan saying: “Beware of luxury and the clothing of the people of shirk.”\xa0\nThe garments of the disbelievers which the Muslims are forbidden to wear are those which are worn exclusively by the disbelievers and are not worn by anyone else. As for those which are worn by both disbelievers and Muslims, there is nothing wrong with wearing them and that is not disliked, because they are not exclusive to the disbelievers.\xa0\nThe scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas were asked about the imitation of the disbelievers that is forbidden. They replied:\xa0\n“What is meant by the imitation of the disbelievers that is forbidden is resembling them in the customs that are exclusive to them, or in the religious beliefs and acts of worship that they have invented, such as imitating them by shaving the beard.\xa0\nWith regard to wearing pants , suits and so on, the basic principle is that all types of clothing are permissible, because this is a matter of customs. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Say (O Muhammad): Who has forbidden the adornment with clothes given by Allah, which He has produced for His slaves, and At-Tayyibat [all kinds of lawful things] of food?”\xa0[Al-A`raf 7:32]\nAn exception from that is made in the case of that for which there is Shar`i evidence proving something to be forbidden or disliked, such as silk for men, or that which shows the `Awrah because it is thin and shows the colour of the skin beneath it, or because it is tight and shows the shape of the `Awrah , because in that case it is like showing it, and showing it is prohibited.\xa0\nSimilarly, clothing which is worn exclusively by the disbelievers is not permitted for men or for women, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade imitating them. Also, it is not permitted for men to wear women's clothing or women to wear men’s clothing, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade men to imitate women and women to imitate men.\xa0\nWearing pants or trousers is not something that is exclusive to the disbelievers, because that is something that is worn by both Muslims and disbelievers in many countries. Rather some people do not like to wear such things in some countries because they are not used to it and it is contrary to the customary dress of the people, even though it is customary among other Muslims.\xa0 However, if the Muslim is in a country where the people are not accustomed to such clothing, it is better for him not to wear it when praying or in public gatherings or in the street.” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Al-Da’imah, 3/307-309)\xa0\nThey also said:\n“Muslim men and women should be keen to adhere to Islamic customs and attitudes, and to follow the Islamic way in their expressions of joy and sorrow and in their clothing, food, drink and all their affairs.\xa0\nIt is not permissible for them to imitate the disbelievers in their clothing by wearing tight clothes that show the shape of the `Awrah, or by wearing thin and see-through clothes that show the `Awrah and do not conceal it, or by wearing short clothes that do not cover the chest, forearms, neck, head or face.” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 3/306, 307)\xa0\nDefinition of imitating the disbelievers\nShaykh Muhammad ibn Salih Al-`Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about the definition of imitating the disbelievers. He replied:\xa0\n“The definition of imitation is: doing what is exclusive to those who are being imitated, so imitating the disbelievers refers to a Muslim doing something that is distinct and exclusive to them.\xa0\nWith regard to things that have become widespread among the Muslims and are no longer something which distinguishes disbelievers from Muslims, then this is not imitation, so it is not prohibited on the grounds that it is imitation, unless it is prohibited for some other reason.\xa0\nWhat we have said is what is indicated by this word, and it was explained in a similar way by the author of Fath Al-Bari when he said (10/272): Some of the Salaf regarded it as disliked to wear the burnous because it was the garment of monks. Malik (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about it and he said: ‘There is nothing wrong with it. It was said to him: But it is the clothing of the Christians. He said: It is worn here.’ End quote.\xa0\nI say: It would have been stronger evidence if, when Malik (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked whether wearing the burnous is prohibited, he had quoted as evidence the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “(The pilgrim in Ihram) should not wear a shirt, pants, a burnous…” \xa0\nIn Al-Fath (10/307) it also says: If we say that they (silken saddlepads) are forbidden because that is an imitation of the non-Arabs, then this is a religious reason, but that was their symbol at that time when they were disbelievers, but now it is not something it is unique to them so this meaning no longer applies, so it is no longer disliked. And Allah knows best.” (Majmu` Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin, 12/290)\xa0\nShaykh Salih Al-Fawzan (may Allah preserve him) said:\xa0\n“It is permissible to wear the garments of disbelievers so long as they are not known to be impure, because the basic principle is that things are pure, and that is not altered by doubt. So what they have woven and dyed is permissible, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his companions used to wear things that had been woven and died by the disbelievers.” (Al-Mulakhkhas Al-Fiqhi, 1/20)\xa0\nTo sum up, it is prohibited for a Muslim to imitate the disbelievers in things that are exclusive to them, whether it be clothing or anything else, but whatever is not exclusive to the disbelievers, there is nothing wrong with it.\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/69789/forbidden-types-of-disbelievers-clothing
146916,"What is the ruling if I enter the mosque when I am travelling, and I find a group of people praying other than the congregational prayer of the mosque for which the adhan and iqamah were given? Do I have to pray with them, and offer the prayer in full when they do so? Or should I pray on my own and shorten my prayer, on the basis that this is not the original congregational prayer? Is it valid for there to be two congregations or groups praying in one mosque at the same time?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nPrayer in congregation is not waived for the traveller, so if he hears the call to prayer, he must answer it, unless he has an excuse.

10547,"I have a strange question. My Aqeedah is that after the body is dead, it is of no use and they cannot hear, but according to a Hadith, there is punishment in the grave. Does this mean that the body is still alive? Also in the quran it is mentioned that martyrs don't die? It is reported in a Hadith in Sahih Muslim that when the Prophet (sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam) addressed the body of Abu Jahl, Imayyah and others, ‘Umar asked him how the dead could hear, to which the Prophet replied that they can hear but cannot reply. Kindly answer my question with detail.","[""Praise be to Allah.Do dead people hear us?\nWhat is mentioned in the question, that the dead do not hear anything which the living say is true and is correct. Allah says (interpretation of the meanings):\xa0\n“but you cannot make hear those who are in graves. ”\xa0[Fatir 35:22]\xa0\n“So verily, you (O Muhammad) cannot make the dead to hear.”\xa0[Ar-Rum 30:52]\nIs there torment and punishment in the grave?\n\xa0The belief of Ahl As-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah is that there is torment and punishment in the grave and life in Al-barzakh (the interval between death and the Day of Resurrection), and there is blessing and pleasure, according to the status of the deceased.\xa0\nThe evidence for that is the verse (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“The Fire, they are exposed to it, morning and afternoon. And on the Day when the Hour will be established (it will be said to the angels): ‘Cause Pharaoh’s people to enter the severest torment!’”[Ghafir 40:46]\xa0\nAllah states here that the people of Pharaoh are exposed to torment morning and afternoon even though they are dead. From this verse, the scholars affirmed that the torment of the grave is real.\xa0\nIbn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“This verse is the main basis of the belief of Ahl As-Sunnah in the torment of Al-barzakh , as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“The Fire, they are exposed to it, morning and afternoon” [Ghaafir 40:46].”\xa0(Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 4/82)\xa0\nAccording to the Hadith of `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her), the wife of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to supplicate in his prayer, “Allahumma inni a`udhu bika min `adhab il-qabr, wa a`udhu bika min fitnat il-masih id-dajjal, wa a`udhu bika min fitnat il-mahya wa fitnat il-mamat, Allahumma ini a`udhu bika min Al-ma’tham wal-maghram (O Allah, I seek refuge in You from the torment of the grave, I seek refuge in You from the tribulation of the Dajjal, I seek refuge in You from the trials of life and death, O Allah, I seek refuge in You from sin and loss).”\xa0(Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 798; Muslim, 589)\xa0\nThe relevant point in this Hadith is that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to seek refuge with Allah from the torment of the grave. This is one of the proofs that confirm the torment of the grave. No one disputed the torment of the grave apart from the Mu`tazilah and some other groups who are not worth paying attention to.\xa0\nInterpreting Prophet Muhammad's Address to the Deceased Polytheists at the Battle of Badr\nWith regard to the Hadith which describes the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) addressing the dead bodies of the polytheists on the day of the battle of Badr, this was a unique case where Allah brought them back to life so that His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) might rebuke them and humiliate them.\n\nIt was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stood over the well of Badr [into which the bodies of the polytheists had been thrown] and said, ‘Have you found the promise of your Lord to be true?’ Then he said, ‘They can hear what I am saying now.’”\xa0(Narrated by Al-Bukhaari, 3980; Muslim, 932)\xa0\nIt was narrated that Abu Talhah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “ ‘Umar said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, why are you speaking to bodies that have no souls?’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘By the One in Whose hand is the soul of Muhammad, you do not hear what I am saying any better than they do.’” Qutadah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Allah brought them back to life so that they could hear what he was saying, so that they might be rebuked and feel regret and shame.\xa0(Narrated by Al-Bukhaari, 3976; Muslim, 2875. See Fath Al-Baari, 7/304)\xa0\n\nThe relevant point here is that Allah caused the people in the well to hear the words of His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), so that they might be humiliated. Nonetheless, it is not correct to deduce from this Hadith that the dead can hear everything, because this applied only to the people in the well. Some scholars made an exception and said that the dead can hear the greeting of Salam, but this is a view for which clear sound evidence is lacking.\nDoes the torment of the grave befall both the soul and the body?\nAccording to the most correct scholarly view, the torment of the grave befalls both the soul and the body .\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“The view of the earliest generations of this Ummah and its Imams is that the torment or blessing (of the grave) happens to the soul of the deceased and his body. After it departs from the body, the soul continues to be blessed or punished, and it is also connected to the body from time to time, so that the blessing or torment befalls the body as well as the soul.\xa0Therefore, we must believe in that which Allah has told us.”\xa0(Al-Ikhtiyarat Al-Fiqhiyyah, p. 94)\xa0\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Shaykh Al-Islam (Ibn Taymiyah) was asked about this matter, and we will quote his reply in full:\xa0\n“Indeed, the torment and blessing happen to both the soul and the body, according to the consensus of the Ahl As-Sunnah wal-Jama’ah. The soul is blessed or tormented separately from the body, and it is blessed or tormented in connection with the body. The body is connected to it, so in this case the blessing or torment happens to them both, and it may happen to the soul separately from the body.\xa0\nThe view of the Salaf and Imams of this Ummah is that when a person dies, he will be in a state of blessing or torment, and that happens to his soul and his body. After the soul has departed from the body, it remains in a state of blessing or torment, and that is sometimes connected to the body and the blessing or torment happens to them both. Then when the Day of Resurrection comes, the souls will be returned to their bodies and they will rise from their graves to meet the Lord of the Worlds. The physical resurrection is a matter upon which the Muslims, Jews and Christians are agreed.”\xa0\xa0(Al-Ruh, p. 51, 52)\xa0\nThe scholars likened that to dreams when one is asleep, for a person may dream that he is going and traveling, and he may feel happiness or grief and sorrow while he is sleeping, and that is when he is in his place and in this world. So it is more apt that things should be different in the life of Al-barzakh which is completely different from the life of this world and the life of the Hereafter.\xa0\nAl-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“If it is said, we see the deceased and how he is in his grave, so how can he be questioned, made to sit up and beaten with iron rods, when no mark is left on him? The answer is that this is not impossible, and indeed there is a similar case in our regular lives, that of the sleeper who feels joy or pain of which we feel nothing.\xa0 A person who is awake may also feel joy or pain because of something he hears or thinks about, and those who are sitting with him feel nothing of that. Similarly, Jibril used to come to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and tell him of the Revelation, and the people present were unaware of it. All of that is clear and evident.”\xa0(Sharh Muslim, 17/201)\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“When a person sleeps, he may feel joy or pain, and that happens to his soul and his body. He may dream that someone is beating him and wake up with pain in his body, or he may dream that he is being fed some good food, then wake up with the taste of food in his mouth. This is something that really happens. If the body and soul of a sleeping person can experience joy and pain that are not felt by the person next to him, and a sleeper may even cry out because of the intensity of pain or fear of what is happening to him, and those who are awake can hear him, and he may speak, reciting Quran or dhikr, or talking to someone, and those who are awake can hear that, even though he is asleep with his eyes closed, and he does not hear them if they speak to him – then how can we deny that the one who is buried in his grave also feels things, when the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) has told us that he “hears the sound of their footsteps” and “You do not hear what I say any better than they do”?\xa0\nThe heart is akin to the grave, hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, when he missed ‘Asr on the day of Al-Khandaq: “May Allah fill their hearts and graves with fire.” Moreover, Allah differentiated between them (graves and hearts) in the verse (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Knows he not that when the contents of the graves are poured forth (all mankind is resurrected)?\nAnd that which is in the hearts (of men) shall be made known?”\xa0[Al-‘Aadiyat 100:9-10]\nThis is just to explain that this could happen.\nWe cannot say that the blessing or torment that the dead experience is like that which a sleeper experiences when he dreams, rather that blessing or torment is more complete and more far-reaching; it is a real blessing and a real torment. Yet, this example is given to show that this is possible. If someone were to say that the dead person does not move in his grave, and the soil does not change, and so on, this matter may be explained in more detail, but that would take too long to explain here. And Allah knows best. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.”\xa0(Majmu’ Al-Fatawa, 4/275, 276)\xa0\nFor more details, please see this category: Torment and Blessing in the Grave\nAnd Allah knows best""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10547/torment-and-blessing-in-the-grave
