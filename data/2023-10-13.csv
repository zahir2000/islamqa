112155,"There is a woman who is a virgin, and does not have a father or brothers, but she has paternal uncles. A man proposed marriage to her, so her younger paternal uncle acted as her guardian for her marriage, even though the older uncle was there. Is this marriage valid?","['Praise be to Allah.If the matter is as you describe, that she has no father or brothers, then if she has no nephews, her younger paternal uncle acting as her guardian for her marriage is valid, even if her older paternal uncle is there, if her younger paternal uncle is an adult of sound mind and good character, and he gives her in marriage to a compatible man with her consent. That is because if the guardians are equal in terms of degree of closeness to the woman, it is valid for any of them to act as her guardian for her marriage, and giving precedence to the oldest one is merely recommended (mustahabb).

87711,"I have had surgery and I have had my monthly period and I want to pray, what should I do? Should I do Tayammum? What is the way to do Tayammum following menses? Should I do Tayammum for each prayer?","['Praise be to Allah.Tayammum when ghusl is not possible after operation\nThe woman who has her menses must do Ghusl (ritual bathing) when she becomes pure from menses and wants to pray. If she is unable to do Ghusl because she cannot get out of bed and thus unable to use water, or because the water will harm her, then she may do Tayammum.\xa0\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Because Islamic Shari`ah is based on ease, Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has made worship easier for those who are excused, according to their excuses, so that they will be able to worship Him without any hardship. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \xa0\n“and [Allah] has not laid upon you in religion any hardship.”\xa0[Al-Hajj 22:78]\xa0\n“Allah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make things difficult for you.”\xa0[Al-Baqarah 2:185]\xa0\n“So keep your duty to Allah and fear Him as much as you can.”\xa0[Al-Taghabun 64:16]\nAlso, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When I command you to do a thing, do as much of it as you can” and said: “Indeed, the religion (of Islam) is easy.”\xa0\nIf a sick person cannot (ritually) purify himself with water, by doing Wudu in the case of minor impurity or Ghusl in the case of major impurity, because he is unable to do so, or because he is afraid that it may make the sickness worse or delay his recovery, then he may do Tayammum , which means striking his hands once on clean dust , then wiping his face with the insides of his fingers and then rubbing his hands together, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And if you are ill, or on a journey, or one of you comes after answering the call of nature, or you have been in contact with women (by sexual relations) and you find no water, perform Tayammum with clean earth and rub therewith your faces and hands .”\xa0[Al-Nisa’ 4:43]\nThe one who is unable to use water comes under the same ruling as one who cannot find any water, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“So keep your duty to Allah and fear Him as much as you can.”\xa0[Al-Taghabun 64:16]\nAnd the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When I command you to do a thing, do as much of it as you can.”\xa0\nHow should a sick person purify himself?\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\xa0\n“Several scenarios may apply with regard to a sick person purifying himself :\xa0\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 If his sickness is mild and there is no fear that using water may lead to death, severe sickness, delay of recovery or increase of pain, or if he is able to use warm water and that will not harm him, then it is not permissible for him to do Tayammum, because it is permitted in order to ward off harm, but he is not likely to be harmed. Also, since he can find water, then he is obliged to use it.\xa0\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 If he has a sickness due to which he fears death or loss of a limb, or fears further sickness that may lead to death or limb loss, then it is permissible for him to do Tayammum, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And do not kill yourselves (nor kill one another). Surely, Allah is Most Merciful to you.”\xa0[Al-Nisa’ 4:29]\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 If he has a sickness which makes him unable to move and there is no one to bring him water, then it is permissible for him to do Tayammum.\xa0\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 If he has wounds, sores, broken limbs or a sickness in which use of water will harm him, and he becomes Junub (major ritual impurity due to sperm discharge), it is permissible for him to do Tayammum, because of the evidence mentioned above. If he is able to wash the sound parts of his body then he must do that, and do Tayammum for the rest.\xa0\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 If the sick person is in a place where there is no water and no dust, and there is no one who can bring him whichever of them if available, then he may pray as he is, and he should not delay the prayer, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \xa0\n“So keep your duty to Allah and fear Him as much as you can.”\xa0[Al-Taghabun 64:16]” (Al-Fatawa Al-Muta`alliqah bil-Tibb wa Ahkam Al-Marda, p. 26)\xa0\nHow to perform Tayammum after menses\nThe way in which to do Tayammum following menses is no different from the way of doing Tayammum in the case of minor impurity.\xa0\nCan you offer two or more prayers with one Tayammum?\nTayammum, like Wudu, removes (ritual) impurity, according to the correct view, so it is permissible to offer more than one obligatory prayer with it, and you do not have to repeat it for every prayer.\xa0\nSo if you do Tayammum for Zuhr, for example, and you do not break your Wudu, it is permissible for you to pray `Asr with it, and so on.\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: If a person does Tayammum for a Nafl prayer, can he offer an obligatory prayer with that Tayammum?\xa0\nHe replied:\xa0\n“Tayammum removes impurity, so he can offer the obligatory prayer even if he did Tayammum for a Nafl prayer, just as if he did Wudu for a Nafl prayer, it is permissible for him to offer an obligatory prayer with the same Wudu. He does not have to repeat Tayammum if the time for the prayer ends, so long as nothing invalidated that Tayammum.""

112110,"Some people write verses from the Quran and erase them with water, then drink the water. If I object to them, they say: It is the words of Allah and we are seeking healing by means of it. Is doing that permissible?","['Praise be to Allah.Doing that is permissible. It is permissible for a person to write Quran with ink that it is permissible to drink, then to put the written paper in water and shake it, then drink it. Some of the early generations used to do that, and they would do it using vessels such as bowls and the like. If a person does that, he has a precedent for doing it. The evidence quoted for doing that is the general meaning of the verse in which Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And We send down of the Quran that which is healing and mercy for the believers}\xa0[al-Isra’ 17:82].\nSo if healing is sought by means of the Quran in this manner, and it is tried and turns out to be beneficial, then it is included in the general meaning of this verse.\nShaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him).\n(Al-Liqa’ al-Maftuh (p. 112).']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/112110/writing-verses-of-quran-and-erasing-them-with-water-then-drinking-the-water
47761,"A person owns a piece of land and one year has passed since he acquired it. Zakah is due because it comes under the heading of trade goods (i.e., he bought it in order to sell it). How should he pay Zakah on it? Please note that he only has a little cash, very little.","['Praise be to Allah.Is there Zakah on business goods?\nZakah is due on trade goods according to the Quran and Sunnah. In the Quran, this is indicated by the general meaning of the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“O you who believe! Spend of the good things which you have (legally) earned, and of that which We have produced from the earth for you.”\xa0[Al-Baqarah 2:267]\nMujahid said: “Spend of the good things which you have (legally) earned” means trade. \xa0\nWith regard to evidence from the Sunnah, Abu Dawud narrated (1562) that Samurah ibn Jundub (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to command us to give Zakah from that which we had prepared for sale .\xa0\nThe Isnad of this Hadith is subject to some discussion, but some of the scholars classed it as sound, such as Ibn `Abd Al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him), and it is the view that the scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas adopted.\xa0(See Fatawa Al-Lajnah Al-Da’imah, 9/331)\xa0\nConditions of Zakah on trade goods\nZakah is due on things that have been prepared for trade if they reach the Nisab (minimum threshold) and one (lunar) year has passed (since they were acquired).\xa0\nHow to calculate Zakah on trade goods\nBased on this, Zakah must be paid on the land which has been in your possession for a year; you have to determine the value of the land at the end of the year, and pay one-quarter of ten percent . So if its value is one hundred thousand (100,000) Dinars, for example, you have to pay Zakah of 2.5% or two and a half thousand (2,500), and so on.\xa0\nWhat happens if you don\'t have cash to pay Zakah on trade goods?\nIf you have cash, then you must pay it and it is not permissible to delay paying Zakah until the land is sold . But if you do not have cash with which to pay the Zakah, then it becomes a debt that you owe and must be paid when it becomes possible to do so. If you cannot do it until you sell the land, then you have to pay Zakah from the price you receive for the land for each year in which Zakah was due.\xa0\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Zakah is due on land that is prepared for trade. The evidence for that is the well-known Hadith of Samurah ibn Jundub (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to command us to give Zakah from that which we had prepared for sale.”\xa0\nHe also said:\xa0\n“If land and other similar things such as houses and cars, etc. are prepared for sale, then you must pay Zakah on them each year according to their value, when one full (lunar) year has passed. It is not permissible to delay that, except in the case of one who is unable to pay the Zakah on them because he does not have any other wealth. Then he may be given a respite until he sells it and pays the Zakah for all the years, each year according to its value at the end of that year, regardless of whether the value is more than the price he gets for it or is less than the price for which he bought the land, car or house.""
