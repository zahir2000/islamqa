402052,"I put on long socks, then I put short socks over the long socks, but the second pair of socks did not cover the place that is to be washed when doing wudu’ [i.e., the entire foot up to the ankle]. I put on both pairs when I was in a state of purity.

Please see the answer to question no. 192736 .\nIf someone puts on khuffs over khuffs, or socks over socks, before invalidating his wudu, and both pairs are intact, it is permissible to wipe over either of them.\nBut if they both have holes in them, or both are short, it is not permissible to wipe over either of them, according to the view that it is not permissible to wipe over the one that has holes, which is the view of the majority.\nIf one of them is short or has holes, it is valid to wipe over the outer one in all cases. In other words, whether it is the long sock or the short sock.\nIt is valid to wipe over the inner sock if it is intact, by inserting one’s hand under the outer sock and wiping the inner sock.\nIt says in Matalib Uli an-Nuha (1/132): If someone who is wearing a khuff puts another khuff over it, so long as his wudu is still valid, even if one of them has a hole in it, it is valid to wipe over the outer khuff in all cases, and to wipe over the inner one if it is the one that fulfils the condition of being intact. It is not valid to wipe over them if both of them have holes, even if, together, they cover the foot.\nIf both of them are intact, then it is valid to wipe over whichever of them he wishes.\nIf he wants to wipe over the inner one, he may put his hand under the outer one and wipe the inner one.\nIf the one who is wearing two khuffs takes off one of them, then he must take off the other one and repeat wudu. End quote.\nIn Hashiyat Ibn Qayid ‘ala al-Muntaha (1/63), it says: If he puts another khuff over it … – That includes four scenarios: either they are both intact, or they both have holes, or the outer one is intact and the inner one has holes, or vice versa.\nIn the first scenario, it is valid to wipe over either of them. In the second scenario, it is not valid to wipe over either of them, even if, together, they cover the foot. In the third scenario, it is valid to wipe over the outer one only. In the fourth scenario, it is valid to wipe over whichever of them he wishes. End quote.\nRuling on wiping over the socks when there is another pair of socks under them\nWhat you have described is the fourth scenario, so it is valid to wipe over the outer socks and it is valid to wipe over the inner socks by putting your hand under the outer one and wiping the inner one.\nIf you take off the outer sock, you must also take off the inner sock.\nWearing a short sock over a long sock is like wearing a sandal over the khuff. At-Tirmidhi (99), an-Nasa’i (125), Abu Dawud (159) and Ibn Majah (559) narrated that al-Mughirah ibn Shu‘bah said:\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did wudu and wiped over his stockings and sandals. This hadith was classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud.\nShaykh Muhammad ibn Ibrahim said: It is valid to wipe over shoes that do not cover the required area, provided that there are thick socks under them that do cover the required area, on condition that they are both put on together, or that the wearer put the shoes on before he invalidated his wudu, and on condition that he only takes them off together, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) wiped over his khuffs and sandals [when he wore them together].\nHe may also wipe over the sock only, but in this case it is not stipulated that he should have put them both on together and the like, or that he must take them both off together.""(Fatawa ash-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibrahim\xa02/68).\nConclusion: It is permissible to wipe over short socks that are worn over long socks, and to take them off together.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/402052/he-put-on-short-socks-that-come-below-the-ankles-over-long-socks-is-it-valid-to-wipe-over-them
178136,"If the Muslims celebrate the birthday of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), why do they not celebrate the birthday of the Prophet of Allah, Jesus (peace be upon him)? Is he not a Prophet who was sent from Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted?","['Praise be to Allah.Do Muslims believe in Jesus?\nBelieving in Jesus (peace be upon him) as a Prophet and Messenger who was sent by Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, to the Children of Israel is part of believing in Allah and His Messengers. No one’s faith is valid unless he believes in all of the Messengers of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon them). Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“The Messenger (Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) believes in what has been sent down to him from his Lord, and (so do) the believers. Each one believes in Allah, His Angels, His Books, and His Messengers. They say, `We make no distinction between one another of His Messengers’” [Al-Baqarah 2:285]\xa0\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“The believers believe that Allah is One, unique and Self-Sufficient; there is no god but He and no Lord other than Him. And they believe in all of the Prophets and Messengers, and the Books that were sent down from heaven to the slaves of Allah, the Messengers and Prophets. They do not differentiate between any of them, believing in some and disbelieving in others; rather in their view they are all truthful, righteous, rightly guided, and they guided people to the ways of goodness.” (Tafsir Ibn Kathir (1/736)\nAs-Sa`di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Disbelieving in some of them is disbelieving in all of them; in fact it is disbelieving in Allah.” (Tafsir As-Sa`di, p. 120)\nIs it permissible to celebrate Prophet Muhammad’s birthday?\nCelebrating the Mawlid or birthday of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is an innovation (Bid`ah). This was not done by the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) or by any of his Companions after him, and it is not known from any of the Imams (leading scholars) of the Muslims that he regarded it as permissible or recommended, let alone participated in it. All of that comes under the heading of prohibited things and reprehensible innovations.\xa0\nThe scholars of the Standing Committee said:\xa0\n“Celebrating the occasion of the Prophet’s birthday is a prohibited innovation, because there is no evidence for that in the Book of Allah or in the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). It was not done by any of his rightly-guided successors (the Rightly-Guided Caliphs) or the best generations.” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah (2/244)\xa0\nPlease see also the answers to questions no.\xa070317 \xa0and\xa013810 \xa0\nWhy do the Muslims not celebrate the birthday of Jesus as they celebrate the birthday of Prophet Muhammad?\xa0\nWhat the common folk and ignorant among the Muslims do of celebrating the Prophet’s birthday is one of the innovated matters that should be opposed and prohibited. Referring to the celebration of the Prophet’s birthday as proof that it is permissible to celebrate Christmas is a notion that is based on false premises, because celebrating the Prophet’s birthday is not permissible, as it is an innovation that has been introduced into the religion, and whatever is compared to an innovation (for the purpose of justifying it) is also an innovation.\xa0\nIs it permissible to celebrate Christmas?\nThe Christian celebration of what they call Christmas is an innovated and polytheistic celebration. It is not permissible for the Muslims to imitate them in that, and Jesus (peace be upon him) has nothing to do with it or them.\xa0\nRather for the Muslims – in addition to it being an innovation – it comes under the heading of imitating the disbelievers in matters that are unique to them and their religion. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever imitates a people is one of them.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud (3512); classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Sunan Abu Dawud. Its Isnad [chain of narration] was classed as good by Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him), who said:\xa0\n“The least that can be said about this Hadith is that it implies that it is prohibited to imitate them. However the apparent meaning indicates that the one who imitates them is a disbeliever, as Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And if any amongst you takes them as Awliya’\xa0[friends, protectors, helpers, etc.,] then surely he is one of them” [Al-Ma’idah 5:51].”\xa0 (Iqtida’ As-Sirat Al-Mustaqim, p. 82-83)\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam (may Allah have mercy on him) also said:\xa0\n“It has become clear to you that one of the causes of the diminishing of the religion of Allah and its teachings, and the prevalence of disbelief and sin, is imitation of the disbelievers, just as one of the foundations of all good is adhering to the ways and teachings of the Prophets. Hence the introduction of innovations into the religion is regarded as a serious matter, even if it does not involve imitating the disbelievers, so how about if the two matters are combined?!” (Iqtida’ As-Sirat Al-Mustaqim, p. 116)\xa0\nIbn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Congratulating the disbelievers on the occasion of Christmas or any of their other religious festivals is prohibited according to scholarly consensus, because it implies approval of what they follow of disbelief and approving of it for them. Even if he does not approve of this disbelief for himself, it is prohibited for the Muslim to approve of rituals of disbelief or to congratulate someone else for them. Similarly, it is prohibited for the Muslims to imitate the disbelievers by having parties on these occasions, or exchanging gifts, distributing sweets or plates of food, taking time off work, and so on, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever imitates a people is one of them.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud)” (Majmu` Fatawa wa Rasa’il Ibn `Uthaymin, 3/45-46)\xa0\nFor more information on the ruling on joining the disbelievers in their festivals, please see the answers to questions no.\xa01130 \xa0and\xa0145950\nThe harm that results from Muslims celebrating Christmas\nTo sum up: the harm that results from Muslims celebrating Christmas may be summarised in the following points:\xa0\nIt involves imitating the disbelievers whose motivation in holding these parties is their Shirk and disbelief in Allah the Almighty. It is not in accordance with the true teachings of the Prophet of Allah Jesus (peace be upon him), because according to our consensus and theirs he did not prescribe such celebrations for them. So they are a combination of Shirk and innovation, in addition to what they mix with that of immoral and evil actions in these parties, as is well known. So how could we imitate them in that regard?\nCelebration of the Prophet’s birthday is not permissible, because it is an innovation that has been introduced, as stated above. So it is not permissible to use it as an analogy, because if the basis of the analogy is corrupt, the entire analogy is corrupt.\nCelebrating Christmas is an evil act in all circumstances, and we cannot say that it is permissible, because its very foundation is corrupt, because of what happens during it of disbelief, evildoing and sin. Such a thing is not fit to be used as an analogy for anything, and it cannot be said that it is permissible under any circumstances.\nIf we say that this corrupt analogy is sound, then we should be consistent and say: why do we not celebrate the birthday of every Prophet? Are they not all Prophets who were sent from Allah? And no one says this.\nKnowing the exact date of the birth of any of the Prophets is not possible, even our Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). The exact date of his birth is not known, as the historians differed concerning this matter, to the extent that there are nine or more different opinions. So the celebration of the Mawlid is invalid both in terms of the date and of Shari`ah. Hence the matter in its entirety, whether it has to do with the birthday of our Prophet or the birthday of the Prophet of Allah Jesus (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), has no basis at all.\nIbn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Celebrating the eve of the birth of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him and his family) is not valid, whether from the point of view of the date or the point of view of Islamic teachings.” (Fatawa Nur `Ala Ad-Darb, 19/45)\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/178136/why-dont-muslims-celebrate-christmas-if-they-believe-in-jesus
115129,How can a Muslim who is really lacking self-confidence become a more confident person? He has tried so many things but has yet to overcome his nervousness when talking to people. May Allah reward you with good for your effort.,"['Praise be to Allah.Meaning of self-confidence in Islam\nSelf-confidence is an acquired characteristic that the Muslim needs to know how to acquire so that he will be one of those who have self-confidence. But first of all he has to differentiate between self-confidence and arrogance.\xa0\nSelf-confidence means being aware of what Allah has given you of good characteristics and striving accordingly to attain that which will benefit you. If you misuse it, you will be filled with arrogance and self -admiration , which are two destructive problems. If you deny those blessings that have been given to you and the good characteristics that Allah has blessed you with, you will become lazy and apathetic; you will let yourself down and lose the blessings that Allah has given you. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Indeed he succeeds who purifies his ownself (i.e. obeys and performs all that Allah ordered, by following the true Faith of Islamic Monotheism and by doing righteous good deeds).\nAnd indeed he fails who corrupts his ownself (i.e. disobeys what Allah has ordered by rejecting the true Faith of Islamic Monotheism or by following polytheism, or by doing every kind of evil wicked deeds).” [Ash-Shams 91:9-10]\xa0\nIt is worth pointing out something important here, which is that for the Muslim, having self-confidence does not mean that he does not need the help of his Lord, and it does not mean that he does not need his brothers and people in general to advise him and help him. This is what the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) asked his Lord for, which was: not to be left to himself (or to his own devices), not even for the blink of an eye!\xa0\nAbu Bakrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The supplication of the one who is in distress: O Allah, for Your mercy I hope, so do not abandon me to myself even for the blink of an eye. Set all my affairs straight, there is none worthy of worship but You.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud (5090); classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud)\nAl-Nasa’i (10405) narrated from Anas, in a Hadith that was classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih An-Nasa’i, that these words are to be said morning and evening.\xa0\nShaykh Al-`Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\xa0\nWhat is the ruling on saying “So and so has self-confidence” and the like? Is this contrary to the Dua narrated in the Hadith, “do not abandon me to myself even for the blink of an eye”?\nHe replied:\n“There is nothing wrong with that, because what is meant by saying that somebody is self-confident is that he is certain about something and is sure of it. There is no doubt that things may sometimes be attributed to a person on the basis of certainty, and sometimes on the basis of probability, and sometimes on the basis of doubt, and sometimes on the basis of what is most likely to be the case. If he says, for example, “I am certain about that” or “I am certain of myself” or “So and so is certain of himself” or “he is certain about what he is saying”, what is meant is that he is confident about it. There is nothing wrong with that and it is not contrary to the well-known Dua, “do not abandon me to myself even for the blink of an eye,” because the person may be certain of himself by the help of Allah, based on what Allah has given him of knowledge, ability and so on.” (Fatawa Islamiyyah, 4/480)\nHow should a Muslim attain self-confidence?\nSome of the things which we think will increase the Muslim’s self-confidence are:\n\nPutting his trust in his Lord, depending upon Him and seeking support and help from Him. The Muslim cannot do without his Lord, may He be Exalted. As we mentioned above, self-confidence is an acquired characteristic, and the Muslim needs help and support from his Lord. The more he puts his trust in his Lord, the greater his self-confidence will grow and reach the highest level.\n\nWhen Musa (peace be upon him) and his people fled from Pharaoh and his troops, and the two sides saw one another, we see the trust that Musa had in his Lord. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And when the two hosts saw each other, the companions of Musa said: ‘We are sure to be overtaken.’ [Musa] said: ‘Nay, verily, with me is my Lord. He will guide me.’” [Ash-Shu`ara’ 26:61-62]\xa0\n\nFinding out what his strong points are and increasing them; what he does well and developing it; and what his weak points are and trying to deal with them.\xa0\n\nIn order to develop self-confidence it is essential to look with gratitude at what Allah has given you of skills and characteristics, so that this will motivate you to strengthen your self-confidence. With regard to your weak points, you have to try to deal with them and develop them so that they reach the same level as your other, good skills and characteristics.\xa0\n\nIt is very important for the Muslim who is seeking ways of increasing his self-confidence not to repeat negative words, such as saying that he has no self-confidence or that he will never succeed at work.\xa0\nThe Muslim has to set specific goals for his life and check on the outcome time after time, because the person who is self-confident will make sure that his goal is achieved on the basis of good planning and with the help of his Lord.\nThe Muslim should seek righteous companions, because that will give him a motive to succeed and encourage him to make greater efforts. The righteous companions will not overlook their friend’s weak points; rather they will guide him to follow the better path. Thus good companions are one of the factors of success for the confident Muslim.\nHe should not be distracted by previous difficult experiences and past failures, because that will spoil his efforts and make him look down on the success he has achieved. This is not something that the Muslim wants for himself.\n\nHow to control anger in Islam\nControlling one’s behaviour and actions is something that the Muslim can do and it is within his capabilities. Part of that is anger; the Muslim should be confident that he is able, with the help of his Lord, to rid himself of the evils and bad effects of anger and strive to mend his ways and discipline himself to adhere to the laws of Allah. This is something that is very easy indeed for the one who wants to achieve it, so long as he has a great deal of resolve to complete what he wants to achieve of disciplining himself and purifying his soul.\nThe one who wants to rid himself of anger has only to hasten to take action. This, in fact, is what we are lacking. The words are many but the actions are few. So let the Muslim who wants to purify his soul train himself to take action, do what his Lord has commanded him and refrain from what his Lord has forbidden him to do. Thus he will be one of the successful, In Sha Allah.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/115129/what-does-self-confidence-mean-in-islam
113064,"This is a message that I have seen a lot on the Internet, but in fact I have not sent it to anyone because I am not sure if it is an innovation (Bid`ah) or not. Is it permissible to spread it and will we be rewarded for doing so, or is this not permissible because it is an innovation?","[""Praise be to Allah.You have done very well not to spread this message which is widespread on many websites on which uneducated attitudes and ignorance prevail.\xa0\nWith regard to those who published this message and want the Muslims to pray and recite Dhikr, we do not doubt that their intentions are good and great, especially if they want acts of obedience and worship to be done at a time when sins are being committed. However, this good and righteous intention does not make the actions legitimate, sound or acceptable in Shari`ah. Rather it is essential that the action be in accordance with Shari`ah in terms of its reason, type, quantity, manner, time and place. For a detailed discussion on these six categories, please see the answer to question number\xa021519 . In this manner the Muslim may distinguish between legitimate and innovated actions.\xa0\nWe may list the reasons why this message should not be spread by noting a number of points, including the following:\xa0\n\nThere have been Jahili special occasions [with practices similar to those in Jahiliyyah (i.e., the pre Islamic era)] and special occasions of the disbelievers and misguided since the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) until the present time, but we have not seen any text from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) which encourages us to do acts of worship and obedience at the time when others are committing acts of evil and disobedience, or to do prescribed actions at the time when innovated actions are being done. There is no report of any of the well-known imams recommending doing such a thing.\xa0\n\nThis comes under the heading of dealing with sin by means of innovation, as happened in the case of responding to the innovation of mourning on the occasion of 'Ashura , as done by the Rafidis, by introducing the innovation of spending a great deal and making a show of joy and happiness.\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“As for taking the days of calamities as occasions for mourning, this is not part of the religion of the Muslims; rather it is closer to the religion of Jahiliyyah. Thus they missed out on the virtue and reward of fasting on this day. Some other people introduced things on the basis of fabricated Hadiths for which there is no basis, such as the virtue of doing Ghusl on this day, or applying kohl to the eyes, or shaking hands. These and similar things are innovations, all of which are disliked. What is recommended is to fast on this day.\xa0\nThere are also well known reports about spending generously on one's family on this day, such as the Hadith of Ibrahim ibn Muhammad ibn Al-Muntashir from his father, who said: We heard that the one who spends generously on his family on the day of 'Ashura, Allah will give him in abundance for the rest of the year. This was narrated by Ibn `Uyaynah, but the fact that he said `we heard that…’ and it is not known who said it indicates that the chain of narrators is interrupted. It is most likely that this was fabricated because of the hatred that appeared between the Nasibis and Rafidis. The Rafidis regarded the day of 'Ashura as a day of mourning, so the Nasibis fabricated reports about it which indicated that one should spend generously on this day and take it as an `Eid. Both views are false.\n\xa0It is not permissible for anyone to change anything in Islam for the sake of anyone. Expressing joy and happiness on the day of `Ashura and spending generously on this day are all innovations that were introduced as a reaction against the Rafidis.” (Iqtida’ Al-Siraat Al-Mustaqeem, p. 300, 301)\xa0\nWe have quoted some other valuable words of Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah in the answer to question number\xa04033 .\xa0\n\nThere are special times for offering Du`a and prayers as prescribed in Islam. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) encouraged us to offer Du`a at these times, such as the last third of the night, which is the time when the Lord, may He be Glorified and Exalted, descends to the nearest heaven. Encouraging people to do that at a time when no authentic text has been narrated concerning it is introducing legislation concerning the reason or the time, and going against Shari`ah with regard to either of them is sufficient to deem the action to be a reprehensible innovation, so how about if it has to do with both of them?!\xa0\n\nIn the answer to question number\xa08375 , we were asked about giving charity to poor families at the time of the Gregorian New Year, and we replied that it is not allowed. Among the things that we said there was the following:\nIf we Muslims want to give in charity, we can give to those who really deserve it, and we should not aim to do that specifically on the days of the disbelievers’ festivals. We should do that whenever there is a need, and make the most of good and great occasions such as the month of Ramadan and the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah , and other virtuous occasions when rewards are multiplied.”\xa0\nThe basic principle for a Muslim is to follow (the Sunnah) and not introduce innovations. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Say (O Muhammad to mankind): `If you (really) love Allah, then follow me (i.e. accept Islamic Monotheism, follow the Quran and the Sunnah), Allah will love you and forgive you your sins. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.’\xa0\n32.\xa0Say (O Muhammad): `Obey Allah and the Messenger (Muhammad).” But if they turn away, then Allah does not like the disbelievers.’” [Al `Imran 3:21, 32]\xa0\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“This verse states that everyone who claims to love Allah but is not following the path of Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is lying in his claim unless he follows the path or religion of Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in all his words and deeds, as it is proven in an authentic report that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever introduces an action that is not part of this matter of ours will have it rejected.” (Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 2/32)\nShaykh Muhammad ibn Salih Al-`Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“You should love the Messenger more than you love yourselves, and your faith is not complete unless you do that. Do not introduce into his religion anything that is not part of it. What the seekers of knowledge should do is explain to the people and tell them: Occupy yourselves with legitimate and sound acts of worship; remember Allah; send blessings upon the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) at all times; establish regular prayer; pay Zakah; and be kind towards the Muslims at all times.” (Liqa’at Al-Bab Al-Maftuh, 35/5)\xa0\n\nYou are forgetting to do what you are obliged to do with regard to these sins and evils, which is enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil, offering sincere advice to those who are going against Islam, and focusing on individual acts of worship when there are other communal acts of disobedience and evil which you should not do.\xa0\n\nWhat we think is that it is prohibited to spread such messages and that it is an innovation to adhere to these acts of worship on such occasions. It is sufficient for you to warn against forbidden celebrations on occasions of shirk and innovation. You will be rewarded for that and you will be doing your duty with regard to these sins.\xa0\nPlease see the answer to question no.\xa060219 \xa0for some comments on good intentions and that good intentions will not benefit a person or make his innovated deeds rewardable.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/113064/spreading-messages-about-new-years-eve-dhikr-and-quran-gatherings
82392,What is the Islamic ruling on a woman travelling to seek knowledge without a Mahram?.,"['Praise be to Allah.The authentic evidence indicates that a woman is not allowed to travel except with a Mahram . This is part of the perfection and greatness of Islam, which protects honour, and takes care of women and holds them in high esteem, and strives to protect them and guard them against the causes of temptation and deviation, whether she is the one who is tempted or is the source of temptation.\xa0\nThe evidence includes the Hadith narrated by Al-Bukhari (1729) and Muslim (2391) from Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No woman should travel except with a Mahram , and no man should enter upon her unless there is a Mahram  with her.” A man said: “O Messenger of Allah, I want to go out with such and such an army and my wife wants to go for Hajj .” He said: “Go out with her.”\xa0\nBased on that, it is not permissible for a woman to travel to seek knowledge without a Mahram . She should acquire the knowledge that she needs in the many ways that are available, such as listening to tapes, asking scholars over the phone and other means that Allah has made available in these times.\xa0\nThe Standing Committee was asked: Can a woman go out to study medicine, if it is obligatory or permissible, if doing so will lead to the following things no matter how much she tries to avoid them:\xa0\n\nMixing with men, such as speaking to the patients, the tutor of medicine and on public transport.\nTravelling from a country such as Sudan to Egypt, even if the journey will take only hours, and not three days.\nIs it permissible for her to stay alone without a Mahram in order to learn medicine, if she is going to stay with a group of women, along with the circumstances described above?\n\nThey replied:\xa0\n\n“Firstly: if her going out to learn medicine will lead to her mixing with men during her study or when riding in mixed transportation that will lead to temptation, then it is not permissible for her to do that, because guarding her honour is an individual obligation, but learning medicine is a communal obligation, and an individual obligation takes precedence over a communal obligation. As for merely speaking to a patient or a teacher of medicine, that is not prohibited, rather what is prohibited is making the voice soft and appealing when speaking to him, which may tempt those in whose heart is the sickness of evil and hypocrisy. This does not apply only to learning medicine.\xa0\nSecondly: If she has a Mahram who can travel with her so that she can learn medicine, or teach it, or treat a patient, that is permissible. If she does not have a husband or Mahram who can travel with her, then it is prohibited, even if the journey is by plane, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No woman should travel except with a Mahram.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim). And because of what we have stated above about the interests of protecting honour taking precedence over the interests of learning medicine or teaching it, etc.\xa0\nThirdly: If her staying with a trustworthy group of women is so that she may learn medicine or teach it, or treat women, then it is permissible, but if there is the fear of temptation because of not having a husband or Mahram with her, then it is not permissible. If she is going to treat men, that is not permissible unless it is a dire need and she is not alone with a man .""
