278724,"In October 2016, it was the time of the date harvest and sale of the harvest by the farmers to the date dealers at competitive prices. Praise be to Allah, I bought ten tons of top-quality dates at the seasonal price, which is 5.5 dinars. But when I wanted to receive the quantity referred to above, the seller started to delay delivery, until finally he admitted that he did not possess this quantity of dates and he did not have the money to buy that quantity and quality of dates from the market. He wants to buy it back from me on credit, and without meeting the condition of exchange on the spot. Praise be to Allah and by the grace of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, I did not agree to sell it back to him because I had not received it, and I insisted that he should deliver what I had ordered from him. But because a long time had passed, and after the end of Ramadan, this product became very scarce in the market, and most likely this seller who has been delaying delivery, even if he has the money now, will not be able to deliver my order to me, because the price has gone up and is now 11 dinars, and there is no one who can give you this large quantity even at this price. It is clear that this seller, who has been delaying delivery of my order, and after checking the market, will never be able to deliver my order with the same specifications and quantity until October of this year, after waiting for the new harvest. Please note that the price of a kilogram of dates will drop from 11 dinars to the regular harvest season price, which is 5.5 dinars, and I will lose the profit I could have made, which is 3.5-4.5 dinars, after deducting transportation and shipping costs. My question is: I do not know if I can sell to him without the exchange taking place on the spot. It seems that it is not permissible, on the grounds that dates are one of the types of food for which it is stipulated that the exchange should take place on the spot and it should be sold to a different merchant. Or should I ask him to compensate me for the profit I could have made, were it not for his clear delay in delivering my product for ten months and preventing me from benefiting from my cash by doing business with it, since it caused me to miss out on more than one opportunity by delaying delivery of the dates I could have sold?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt is permissible to sell these dates back to the seller before receiving them, according to the more correct view. This comes under the heading of selling what is to be delivered [in a salam transaction, when payment has been made in advance] before receiving it. So it is permissible to sell it back to the seller, because selling a debt to the one who owes it is permissible. But that is subject to certain conditions, one of which is that you should sell it to him at today’s price, meaning the price on the day of the sale, or less, but not more. Another condition is that if you sell it to him for cash, then it is permissible for him to pay immediately or sometime in the future. But if you sell it to him in return for wheat and the like, it is forbidden to delay payment, and the exchange must be made on the spot. Also, it is not permissible for you to sell it to him in return for dates to be delivered sometime in the future with an additional amount, because when selling dates for dates it is stipulated that they should be of equal amounts and the exchange should take place on the spot.\nThis is the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah and Ibn al-Qayyim. It is also the view of Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him), and was narrated in one report from Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If someone were to say: Is it permissible to sell something that was to be delivered before having received it [salam transaction]? The answer is: Yes, it is permissible to sell it back to the one who was supposed to deliver it. According to Shaykh al-Islam, it is permissible to sell it even to a third party, but there are some reservations about that, because in reality, if you sell it to a third party, he may not be able to receive it. Moreover, if you sell it to a third party for something that may be sold for payment later, this means that he is selling something that he has not yet received.\nThe evidence for the permissibility of selling it to a third party is not clear, and Shaykh al-Islam regards it as permissible to sell a debt to a third party, but that is subject to the condition that he has the ability to receive it.\nBut if he sells it back to the person who sold it to him [in a salam transaction] and was supposed to deliver it to him later on, then there are three conditions which must be met:\n\nThe first condition:\n\nhe should not make a profit, such as selling the goods at the current price, because if he sells them for more than the current price, then he will be making a profit on something that is not in his possession and for which he is not liable. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade making a profit on something that is not in one’s possession and for which one is not liable. For example, if a person entered into a salam transaction to buy one hundred sa‘s of wheat, paying in advance for it to be delivered later, then when the time for delivery came its value was now 200 dirhams only, so he says: I will sell it back to you for 250 dirhams, that is not permissible, because he is making a profit on this wheat before it came into his possession and he became liable for it, as he did not take possession of it and did not receive it. Thus he will have made a profit on something that was not in his possession and for which he was not liable. Moreover, in the hadith of Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) it says: “There is nothing wrong with accepting a deal on the basis of the current price, so that he will not be making a profit on something that is not in his possession and for which he is not liable.”\nSo if the hundred sa‘s are worth 200 dirhams, and he sells it back to him for 150, that is permissible, because if it is permissible to sell it at the current price, then it is more appropriate to say that it is permissible to sell it back to him for a lower price.\nBecause we gave as the reason for it not being permissible to sell it for more than the current price as being so that he does not make a profit on that which did not come into his possession and for which he did not become liable, in this case he is not making a profit; rather he is incurring a loss.\nWhat is meant by the current price is that it should not be more than that; if it is less than that, that is fine.\n\nThe second condition:\n\nthe exchange should take place before parting, if he sold him something that is subject to riba an-nasi’ah, for example, selling wheat for barley, one hundred sa‘s of wheat for two hundred sa‘s of barley. This is permissible, on condition that the exchange takes place on the spot, before parting, because when selling wheat for barley, it is stipulated that the exchange should take place on the spot, before parting, because of the hadith of Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him). There is nothing wrong with accepting the deal on the basis of the current price, so long as you have not parted and there is nothing still owing between you, because it is permissible to sell dirhams for dinars or dinars for dirhams, but when selling dirhams for dinars, it is stipulated that the exchange should take place on the spot, before parting.\n\nThe third condition:\n\nthat should not be made the price for another salam transaction [payment in advance for something to be delivered later on], because if he does that, in most cases he will make a profit on that, in which case he is making a profit on something of which he did not take possession and did not become liable for. For example, when the time comes for delivery of the one hundred sa‘s of wheat, the two parties say: We will make it a payment in advance for five sheep, because payment for animals in advance is permissible, as noted above, five sheep of such and such a description, to be delivered in one year’s time. This is not permissible, because usually that is only done to make a profit, as these five sheep are equal in value to 120 sa‘s [of wheat], and because this leads to messing about with the debt, as every time his debt becomes due, he will make it a payment in advance for something else. This is a trick aimed at messing about with what is owed and increasing what the debtor owes in this way; every time the debt becomes due, he makes it a down payment for another salam transaction, and so on, until what is owed accumulates and increases.\nSo what is more likely to be the case is that selling the debt [what you are owed] is permissible, but it is subject to the three conditions mentioned above.\nAccording to our madhhab, however, selling it is not permissible at all. The evidence for that is the hadith which says that whoever pays in advance for something to be delivered later on [salam transaction] should not divert the deal to something else, as noted above.\nBut this hadith is da‘if (weak), as was noted by Ibn al-Qayyim in Tahdheeb as-Sunan.\nEven if we assume that it is sahih (sound), we should interpret it as meaning that the one who paid in advance for something to be delivered later on should not divert it to someone else, meaning to someone other than the one who paid for it in advance. In other words, he should not make it capital for a new salam transaction.\nBut if we say that the hadith is not sahih, then selling what you are owed after having paid for it in advance is permissible in principle, because of the general meaning of the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Allah has permitted trade}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:275].\nMoreover, the hadith of Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) indicates that such transactions are permissible, because there is no difference between what is owed in a salam transaction [payment in advance] and any other transaction. Whoever claims that there is a difference between what is owed in the salam transaction and other types of debts, let him explain that to us.""(Ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘\xa0 9/87).\nSecondly:\nIf the seller delivers the dates to you, it is not permissible for you to demand compensation from him for missed opportunities, or for the expected profits [that you missed out on], no matter how long he delayed it, because compensation for a delay in paying a debt is riba.\nIt says in a statement of the Islamic Fiqh Council regarding penalty clauses:\nThe Council affirms its previous statements regarding penalty clauses that were mentioned in its statement on salam transactions, no. 85 (2/9), the text of which is as follows: It is not permissible to stipulate a penalty in the event of delay in the delivery of goods for which payment was made in advance [salam translation], because it is a kind of debt, and it is not permissible to increase the debt in the event of a delay in payment. And [the Council affirms] its statement regarding selling by instalments, no. 51 (2/6), the text of which is as follows: If the purchaser (the debtor) delays payment of instalments beyond the stated term, it is not permissible to compel him to pay anything in addition to what is owed, with or without prior stipulation, because that is riba, which is prohibited.""(Qararat al-Majma‘\xa0 p. 371).\nHere it is worth noting that delaying payment is prohibited and incurs sin, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “For a rich man to delay payment of what he owes is wrongdoing.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (2400) and Muslim (1564).\nDelaying payment means taking too long to pay back what is owed, with no excuse.\nAnd the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Any delay on the part of one who can afford (to repay a debt) makes it permissible to dishonour him and punish him.” Narrated by Abu Dawud (3268), an-Nasa’i (4689) and Ibn Majah (2427); classed as hasan by al-Albani in Irwa’ al-Ghalil (1434).\nWhat is meant by it being permissible to dishonour him is that the lender may say: So and so is taking too long to pay what he owes me and is wronging me. What is meant by punishment here is detaining him, as was explained by Sufyan and others.\nConclusion:\nThere is nothing wrong with you selling back to him the dates that he owes you in return for dinars, on condition that that be at the current market price.\nAnd there is nothing wrong with delaying payment in full or in part, because when selling the dates for dinars, there is no stipulation that the exchange should take place on the spot, before parting.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/278724/conditions-of-selling-back-to-the-seller-what-has-not-yet-been-received
256427,"I have been confused about this issue for some time. I asked some people, but I am still not convinced. I understand that Allah has granted us and the jinn free will, and I actually feel that. But there are many hadiths in Bukhari which say that in reality, Allah has decreed whether a person will be pious or an evildoer, rich or poor, and so on. So everything is basically already decreed. Anas ibn Malik narrated that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah appoints an angel in the womb, who says, ‘O Lord, a nutfah (sperm-drop)? O Lord, an ‘alaqah (a clinging clot)? O Lord, a mudghah (lump of flesh)?’ When Allah decrees that it is to be created, (the angel) says, ‘O Lord, male or female? Doomed or blessed? What is his provision? What is his lifespan?’ And that is written in his mother’s womb.” Sahih al-Bukhari, hadith no. 6595. And in Surat an-Nahl, verse 93, Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {And if Allah had willed, He could have made you [of] one religion, but He causes to stray whom He wills and guides whom He wills. And you will surely be questioned about what you used to do}. The verses and hadiths mentioned above, and others, indicate that our deeds, both righteous and bad, are already decreed. I also know that we are constantly being tested, as Allah says in the opening verses of Surat al-‘Ankabut and elsewhere, whilst also having the freedom to choose to do righteous or evil deeds. But many verses and hadiths state that the Shaytan is responsible for misguiding us through his schemes and power, because he knows us inside out, but we do not know him at all.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe accountable individual has the ability and freedom to choose, whether he is a human or a jinni. Through this ability and free will he may believe or disbelieve, obey or disobey, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And say, “The truth is from your Lord, so whoever wills - let him believe; and whoever wills - let him disbelieve.” Indeed, We have prepared for the wrongdoers a fire whose walls will surround them}[al-Kahf 18:29].\nAnd He says:\n{Indeed, We created man from a sperm-drop mixture that We may try him; and We made him hearing and seeing.\nIndeed, We guided him to the way, be he grateful or be he ungrateful}[al-Insan 76:2-3].\nBecause the accountable individual is capable and has the freedom to choose, he will be requited for his deeds; if they are good then the outcome will be good, and if they are bad then the outcome will be bad, and your Lord is not ever unjust to His slaves.\n{So whoever does an atom’s weight of good will see it,\nAnd whoever does an atom’s weight of evil will see it}[az-Zalzalah 99:7-8].\nIf man had no free will and was forced to do what he does, then punishing him for these actions would be unjust, but Allah is far above being unjust.\nEvery person is aware that he has free will, so no one forces him to pray or go to the mosque, just as no one forces him to do haram deeds or go to places where such things are done.\nSecondly:\nBecause Allah, may He be exalted, is the Creator, it is no wonder that He knows His slave, what he is going to do and what his ultimate fate will be, whether he is blessed [destined for paradise] or doomed [destined for hell]. Allah, may He be glorified, knew that and wrote it with Him in al-Lawh al-Mahfuz, and He commands the angel to write that down when the foetus is still in his mother’s womb.\nBut this prior knowledge is hidden from man, and he is not aware of it. Allah does not force him to do anything or to refrain from anything. All the individual has to do is strive, and he will be requited for his efforts, like a student who is given a book to study and be tested on. If he works hard and strives he will succeed, but if he is heedless he will fail, even though his teacher already knows the expected outcome because he knows the student and is aware of his situation.\nThis is only an example, to make the matter easy to understand, and to Allah belong the most sublime attributes. Allah is the Creator of man and He knows the stealth of the eyes and all that the hearts conceal, and He has perfect knowledge of His slave, whom He created, and is aware of his situation. {How could He Who created not know His own creation, when He is the Knower of subtleties, the All-Aware?} [al-Mulk 67:14].\n\xa0As Allah, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{and Allah sends astray [thereby] whom He wills and guides whom He wills. And He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise}\xa0[Ibrahim 14:4]\n{And if Allah had willed, He could have made you [of] one religion, but He causes to stray whom He wills and guides whom He wills. And you will surely be questioned about what you used to do}\xa0[an-Nahl 16:93]\n{Whoever Allah guides - he is the [rightly] guided; and whoever He sends astray - it is those who are the losers}\xa0[al-A‘raf 7:178].\nAllah’s guidance is of two types, general and specific. As for the general type, that refers to guidance in the sense of showing the way and making the truth clear, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And as for Thamud, We guided them, but they preferred blindness over guidance, so the thunderbolt of humiliating punishment seized them for what they used to earn}\xa0[Fussilat 41:17]\n– that is, We showed them the path of truth.\nAnd Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Indeed, We guided him to the way, be he grateful or be he ungrateful}\xa0[al-Insan 76:2-3].\nAs for that which is specific, this guidance is for His believing slaves, meaning that He helps them to find and adhere to the path of guidance. For example, Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Those are the ones whom Allah has guided, so from their guidance take an example. Say, “I ask of you for this message no payment. It is not but a reminder for the worlds”}\xa0[al-An‘am 6:90]\n{And thus We have revealed to you an inspiration of Our command. You did not know what is the Book or [what is] faith, but We have made it a light by which We guide whom We will of Our servants. And indeed, [O Muhammad], you guide to a straight path}\xa0[ash-Shura 42:52]\n{And those who strive for Us - We will surely guide them to Our ways. And indeed, Allah is with the doers of good}\xa0[al-‘Ankabut 29:69]\n{But Allah has endeared to you the faith and has made it pleasing in your hearts and has made hateful to you disbelief, defiance and disobedience. Those are the [rightly] guided.\n[It is] as bounty from Allah and favor. And Allah is Knowing and Wise}\xa0[al-Hujurat 49:7-8].\nAs for misguidance, this refers to when Allah leaves a person to his own devices, and does not grant him the means of help and support.\nAt-Tahawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his famous book al-‘Aqidah: Allah guides whomever He wills, protecting him from sin and granting him well-being by His grace, and He leaves astray whomever He wills, forsaking him and putting him through trials by His justice. All of them are subject to His grace or justice, as He wills.\nGuidance, according to Ahl as-Sunnah wa’l-Jama‘ah, is when Allah grants a person His help and guidance, and makes things easy for him. Forsaking is when He leaves a person to his own devices, without any help or support.\nIt cannot be said: Why did He help this one and not that one?\nAllah’s help is based on His grace and His forsaking is based on His justice, and He, may He be glorified, {He cannot be questioned about what He does, but they will be questioned} [al-Anbiya’ 21:23].\nThat is not merely because He has might and control, but because He has perfect knowledge, power, mercy and wisdom. For He, may He be glorified and exalted, is the most just of those who judge and the most merciful of those who show mercy; He is more merciful towards His slaves than a mother towards her child, and He has perfected everything which He has created.""(Fatawa Shaykh al-Islam\xa0 79).\nAllah, may He be glorified, knows best who is deserving of grace and who is not, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{but Allah guides whom He wills. And He is most knowing of the [rightly] guided}\xa0[al-Qasas 28:56]\n{And thus We have tried some of them through others that the disbelievers might say, ""Is it these whom Allah has favored among us?"" Is not Allah most knowing of those who are grateful}\xa0[al-An‘am 6:53].\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said, explaining this important issue:\nIf it is said: If it is up to the will of Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, and all control is in His hand, then what power does man have, and what could he do if Allah has decreed that he is to be misguided and not guided?\nWe say: The answer to that is that Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, only guides those who deserve to be guided, and He leaves astray those who deserve to be left astray. Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And when they deviated, Allah caused their hearts to deviate}\xa0[as-Saff 61:5]\n{So for their breaking of the covenant We cursed them and made their hearts hard. They distort words from their [proper] usages and have forgotten a portion of that of which they were reminded}\xa0[al-Ma’idah 5:13].\nThus Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, has explained that the reason why He causes to go astray the who goes astray is only because of the person himself, and the person does not know what Allah, may He be exalted, has decreed for him, because he is unaware of the decree until after what was decreed has happened. Therefore he does not know what Allah has decreed for him, and whether he will be misguided or guided.\nWhy would he choose the path of misguidance, then argue that Allah, may He be exalted, wanted him to do that!\nIs it not more appropriate for him to choose the path of guidance, then say: Allah, may He be exalted, has guided me to the straight path.""(Risalah fi’l-Qada’ wa’l-Qadar, p.14).\nFor the rest of his words, please see the answer to question no. 220690 .\nThus we may conclude that:\n\nThe accountable person is free to choose whether to obey or disobey of his own free will, and he will be requited for that.\nAllah knows what His slave’s fate will be, and He has written that with Him.\nAllah supports and helps His believing slave, and He knows best who is deserving of support and help.\nAllah forsakes whomever He will, and does not grant him support or help him. His support is based on His grace and His forsaking is based on His justice.\nThe one who is helped is the one who asks Allah for support and help, because he cannot do without the grace of Allah for even the blink of an eye. Hence Allah, may He be exalted, says in Surat al-Fatihah: {It is You we worship and You we ask for help} [al-Fatihah 1:5]. So the religion is based on these two matters: worship and seeking help.\nThe believing slave affirms the grace of Allah, may He be exalted, acknowledges the blessings that He has bestowed upon him, and attributes all goodness and success to Him, as Allah tells us that the people of Paradise will say (interpretation of the meaning): { And We will have removed whatever is within their breasts of resentment, [while] flowing beneath them are rivers. And they will say, “Praise to Allah, who has guided us to this; and we would never have been guided if Allah had not guided us. Certainly the messengers of our Lord had come with the truth.” And they will be called, “This is Paradise, which you have been made to inherit for what you used to do”} [al-A‘raf 7:43].\n\nReflect on how this verse mentions together the grace and guidance of Allah, and the fact that paradise is earned through striving.\nIgnore these intrusive thoughts and focus on that which will benefit you, for this realm is the realm of striving and planting, and the hereafter is the realm of reward and harvesting. The people of Paradise will feel sad for wasting even a moment in which they did not remember Allah, so strive to attain virtues, do obligatory duties and compete for the highest levels in paradise. Ask Allah to accept your efforts, and to guide and help you.\nAs for the Shaytan, he tries to mislead people, but he has no power over the sincere slaves of Allah, as Allah, may He be exalted, tells us (interpretation of the meaning):\n{So when you recite the Qur’an, [first] seek refuge in Allah from Satan, the expelled [from His mercy].\nIndeed, there is for him no authority over those who have believed and rely upon their Lord.\nHis authority is only over those who take him as an ally and those who through him associate others with Allah }[an-Nahl 16:98-100].\nOn the Day of Resurrection, the Shaytan will disavow those who followed him and will tell them that he had no power over them; he only called them and they responded to him.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{ And Satan will say when the matter has been concluded, “Indeed, Allah had promised you the promise of truth. And I promised you, but I betrayed you. But I had no authority over you except that I invited you, and you responded to me. So do not blame me; but blame yourselves. I cannot be called to your aid, nor can you be called to my aid. Indeed, I deny your association of me [with Allah] before. Indeed, for the wrongdoers is a painful punishment”}[Ibrahim 14:22].\nWe ask Allah to help and guide us and you.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/256427/man-has-free-will-and-choice-and-allah-knows-whether-he-is-doomed-or-blessed
