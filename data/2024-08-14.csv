487612,"How do we respond to those Christians who claim that the Quran was plagiarized from the Bible due to the similarities between both religions such as the concept of Paradise and Hellfire, Day of Judgement, common Prophets such as Noah, Moses, Jesus, Adam, etc, and other similarities between the two books.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe claim that the Quran was plagiarized from the Scriptures of the People of the Book is an ancient and recurrent specious argument that is aimed at a single conclusion: knowing that the similarity between the Holy Quran and the Bible, if it is not explained that it is because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) took it from the scriptures of the People of the Book –\xa0 directly or through an intermediary – then there is no other conclusion than to accept that the source of this similarity is the fact that they both came from a divine source.\nBut if there is no way that the people can accept the divine origin of the Quran, then there remains no other option except to strive hard to propagate this claim and spread it among people, telling them that the Quran was plagiarized from the scriptures that came before it.\nThe aim behind that is to disprove the divine origin of the Quran and to fabricate the lie that it was of human origin.\nSecondly:\nThe discussion of how the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) could have learned the stories of the People of the Book, then transmitted them in the Quran – meaning that it was not revelation – is a discussion of various scenarios in which he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) could have learned the stories directly from their holy books, or learned what the scriptures contained of stories, commands and prohibitions, verbally from the People of the Book, if it was not possible for him to study their books himself.\nThis specious argument is based on a number of claims, which are strongly connected to it. If these claims are proven to be baseless, then the conclusions drawn from them will also be proven to be baseless, and this specious argument will lose its foundation and can no longer be valid.\nThese claims may be summed up in three basic claims:\n1. The claim that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was not unlettered or illiterate.\n2. The claim that the Christian scriptures were available to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and he could quote from them or copy them.\n3. The claim that Makkah was a major educational centre for scriptural studies.\nWe will address these three claims briefly and prove them to be unfounded, by Allah’s leave.\nThirdly:\nThe illiteracy of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him):\nOne of the ways of learning about the stories of the People of the Book is learning them directly from their scriptures. This is only possible for one who had the means to learn, and the means to learn have to do either with the learner or the material from which he wants to learn.\nWith regard to the one who wants to learn, we must address the claim that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was not unlettered or illiterate.\nWith regard to the material from which the learner wants to learn, we must address the claim that Arabic translations were available before the Prophet’s mission began.\nThe idea that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was unlettered or illiterate undermines the claim that the Quran was plagiarized from the scriptures of the People of the Book. Therefore there is no way that they could prove this claim, unless they prove that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was not unlettered.\nThose who hold this view followed an unfair method to prove that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was not unlettered. They sought out weak reports or ambiguous statements, or they based their arguments on far-fetched interpretations of some texts, and they ignored the clear, unambiguous texts.\nThe reason for interpreting the texts in this manner is the desire to reach the conclusion they wanted by accusing the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) of plagiarism and denying the divine origin of the Holy Quran.\nThe text of the Quran and Sunnah in many places clearly indicate, leaving no room for doubt, that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was indeed unlettered and that he never narrated any of the stories of the People of the Book before the revelation came to him, and he never wrote anything with his own hand. He knew nothing of the stories before his mission began, and he never spoke of them before that.\nThese texts formed an insurmountable obstacle for the Orientalists and missionaries, and the way in which they dealt with them was one of two ways: either they rejected the many religious texts which affirmed that he was unlettered, and regarded them as an Islamic fabrication with no basis in historical reality, or they accepted these texts in general, but interpreted them in a manner that is not indicated by the linguistic meaning of the words and the context of the Quran and hadiths.\nBoth methods of dealing with the text are flawed; the methodology is flimsy and shows clear bias.\nTo discuss their argument in detail is something that cannot be done in this brief answer. There are books written specifically to address this specious argument and refute it in detail.\nBut because of the importance of this topic – which is affirming that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was unlettered – we will mention some of the evidence from the Holy Quran and corroborating reports from the Prophet’s Sunnah, which prove with certainty that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) could neither read nor write.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{You were not able to read any book before this [Quran], nor were you able to write anything with your right hand. In that case the followers of falsehood would indeed have had cause to doubt}[al-‘Ankabut 29:48].\nThis unambiguous verse clearly states that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not study the scriptures of the People of the Book. It also clearly states that he did not copy anything from them. In other words, this verse affirms that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) had no knowledge of the scriptures of the People of the Book.\nThis is a clear and direct refutation of the claim that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) had knowledge of the scriptures of the People of the book and had studied them in depth.\nOther verses highlight the fact that the people of Makkah knew that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) had no knowledge of the scriptures of the People of the Book, such as the verses in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Likewise We have revealed to you [O Muhammad] a life-giving message by Our command. You knew nothing of the scripture or matters of faith}[ash-Shura 42:54]\n{Say: If Allah had so willed, I would not have recited it to you, nor would He have made it known to you. I spent a whole lifetime among you before it came to me; will you not then understand?}[Yunus 10:160].\nRegarding evidence from the Prophet’s biography (sirah), which proves that he was indeed unlettered, there is a great deal of such evidence, including the following:\n-1-\nIt was narrated from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), that he said: “We are an unlettered community, we do not write or calculate. The month is like this and like this,” meaning that one time it is twenty-nine and one time it is thirty. Narrated by al-Bukhari (1814) and Muslim (1080).\nThis hadith clearly highlights that what is meant by being unlettered here, which leaves no room for confusion or misinterpretation, is not being able to write and not being able to calculate.\n-2-\nThe books of the Prophet’s biography (sirah) and history make no mention of the Prophet writing down the revelation, or of him writing his letters to the kings himself. Rather the opposite is what is mentioned; the Prophet (blessings of peace and Allah be upon him) had scribes who wrote down the revelation and other things.\nIn a brilliant text of Ibn Khaldun, there is a description of the level of education in the Arabian Peninsula just before the Prophet’s mission began. He says: “Among the Arabs, the skill of writing was rarer than she-camels’ eggs. Most of the people were illiterate, especially the desert-dwellers, because this is a skill that is usually found among city-dwellers.\nHence the Arabs did not refer to the illiterate person as being illiterate; rather they would describe one who knew how to read and write as being knowledgeable, because knowing how to read and write was the exception, not the norm among people. As the religious texts and books of Islamic history did not describe Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) as one who knew how to read and write [which would be something remarkable at that time, so the sources would have mentioned it], it is sufficient for the researcher to bear in mind what was the norm at that time, which is that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not know how to read or write.\nAfter noting the above, it is worth pointing out what Dr. ‘Abd ar-Rahman Badawi said in his book Difa‘ ‘an al-Quran dida Muntaqidihi:\n“In order to assume that their claim is valid, it must be assumed that Muhammad knew Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek, and that he must have had a huge library, containing all the texts of the Talmud and true Gospels, along with some of the works of the Greek Church Fathers [early Christian theologians] and the books of various churches and Christian denominations.\nIn the light of this quotation, it becomes clear that the claim of plagiarism on the part of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) not only requires proof that he was not unlettered, but also requires proof that he had access to a huge library!\nIf they failed to prove that he was not unlettered, then how could they prove that he had access to such a huge library? This is something that is utterly impossible.\nYou should realize that access to such a store of knowledge was not possible for any of the People of the Book themselves at that time, so how about a man of Quraysh?”\nFourthly:\nRefuting the claim that Arabic translations of the scriptures of the People of the Book were available before the Prophet’s mission began:\nResearch regarding this matter should be based on different historical resources, far removed from wishful thinking or historical bias. This research should be based on examining the issue from proper historical resources.\nHere we may examine testimony from the most authentic historical sources, namely the Quran and Sunnah – which are the two most reliable resources for studying the biography of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) – as well as the arguments of some Western academics and the statements of non-Muslims, whom no one could accuse of being sympathetic towards Islam. This is the strongest proof against the missionaries and Orientalists, and is more shocking to them than being struck with arrows.\nThe testimony of the Holy Quran and the Prophet’s Sunnah:\nThe one who studies the life of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) will see that there is no evidence, indication or suggestion that any Arabic translation of the Bible existed at that time. Rather, from studying the Quran and Sunnah, he may understand the opposite of that, namely that there was no Arabic translation available.\nAl-Bukhari narrated in his Sahih (4458) from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: The people of the Torah used to read the Torah in Hebrew and explain it in Arabic to the Muslims.\nTherefore the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not believe the People of the Book and do not disbelieve them. Rather say: We believe in Allah and what He sent down to us.”\nThis hadith indicates that the Jews had a full monopoly on the text and its explanation. If their texts were known in Arabic, there would have been no need for the Jews to read the text or explain it [to the Muslims].\nThis idea is supported by the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{There are some among them who distort the Book with their tongues, so that you would think it is part of the Book, but it is not part of the Book; and they say: This is from Allah, but it is not from Allah. And they tell lies about Allah knowingly}[Al ‘Imran 3:78].\nWhen the Jews used to distort the Book with their tongues, when reading some religious stories, to give the impression that what they were saying was a transmission of what was in their books, the Muslims were unable to check those books in order to find out whether what they were saying was true or not, because the books were not available in Arabic. Hence the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) told the Muslims not to ask the People of the Book about anything. This indicates that the People of the Book had a monopoly on knowledge of their Book. Al-Bukhari gave a chapter [in his Sahih] the heading of: The Prophet’s saying: “Do not ask the People of the Book [about anything].”\nPerhaps one of the clearest proofs is the fact that the polytheist Arabs did not refer to this hypothetical translated text when they wanted to deny his prophethood. They had no argument, so they claimed that a young non-Arab man was the one who was teaching the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). If this translated text had been available, they would have said: You read this text, or it was read to you.\nThe Quran mentions their accusation and rejects their accusation of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{We know full well that they say: It is but a man who teaches him. But the one to whom they point speaks a foreign tongue, whereas this is clear Arabic speech}[an-Nahl 16:103].\nThe testimony of Western academics:\nWe will not discuss the statements of academics on this topic in detail. Rather it is sufficient in this regard to mention the conclusions reached through academic research.\nPerhaps the most important book written on this topic is the book of Bruce Metzger, Professor of New Testament Language and Literature, The Bible in Translation, in which he said:\n“It is most likely that the oldest Arabic translation of the Bible dates back to the eighth century.”\nThe Orientalist Thomas Patrick Hughes wrote: “There is no proof that Muhammad had read the Christian Scriptures… It must be noted that there is no clear evidence to suggest that any Arabic translation of the Old and New Testaments existed prior to the time of Muhammad.”\nAlbert Estero said: “Arabic translations of the Bible may have appeared towards the end of Umayyad rule, at the beginning of the eighth century [CE].”\nGreve concluded that “All that one can say about the possibility of there having been an Arabic translation of the Gospel before the emergence of Islam is that there is no definite sign to confirm that.”\nTo sum up, we may note what was quoted by William Henry Bannock, which is like a consensus among the critics, “The view that the Arabic translation of the New Testament only appeared after the emergence of Islam is the view of most of the mid-nineteenth-century critics.”\nFifthly:\nThe claim that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) plagiarized the Quran through an intermediary:\nAfter proving wrong the idea that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was not illiterate, and confirming that there was no Arabic translation of the Bible at his time, it is established that there is no way that he could have found out what was in the scriptures of the People of the Book directly by reading them himself.\nAfter that, our opponents have only one option, which is to assume that Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) learned about the knowledge of the People of the Book from someone else.\nThe idea that the Prophet acquired the revelation from people is an old idea. The polytheists accused him of that, and the Quran refuted them, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And they say: Tales of the ancients that he has written down; they are dictated to him morning and afternoon.\nSay: It [the Quran] has been sent down by Him Who knows all that is hidden in the heavens and the earth. Verily, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful}[al-Furqan 25:5-6].\nAll that our opponents can do in this regard is to suggest some possibilities and mere assumptions, which are no more than false speculation at best, and are based on weird historical stories that cannot stand up to examination, or some reports with very weak chains of narration.\nBased on that, we will examine these assumptions in the light of the Prophet’s biography, the extent of knowledge of some subtle scientific issues that are mentioned in the text that he brought, and the methodology of the hadith scholars in assessing and accepting reports.\nThe Orientalists and their lackeys among the missionaries mentioned the possibility that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) acquired knowledge from others. It is sufficient for us here to discuss the strongest of these possibilities, and to prove that it is flawed.\nThe idea that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) could have acquired the knowledge of the People of the Book before his mission began is one of the most well-known aspersions that the missionaries and Orientalists cast on him and propagated.\nSometimes they claim that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) had a teacher whom he visited frequently in order to learn the knowledge of the People of the Book. They may even quote hypothetical meetings with some scholars of the People of the Book to support this claim.\nThis is an assumption that they make, which needs to be answered in several ways through a critical examination of its origins, including the following:\n-1-\nThe claim that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) had a teacher before his mission began, from whom he learned the knowledge of the People of the Book, necessarily means that he met with that teacher repeatedly over a lengthy period. But the life of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was different from the life of anyone else, for his life at every stage was documented in great detail, which means that his spending a great deal of time in acquiring the knowledge of the People of the Book for the length of time needed to acquire the huge amount of knowledge that he brought to people is an idea that must be rejected out of hand. If his people had been aware of that, they would have mentioned the time and place of this lengthy period of learning, and where the meetings supposedly took place.\n-2-\nEven if we assume for the sake of argument that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) ever met with Jewish and Christian scholars before his mission began, such meetings would not have allowed him to acquire all this vast and precise knowledge, because he did not meet anyone before his mission began – as is stated in the books of his biography – apart from the monk Bahirah, in a very brief meeting, if the report can be proven, and Waraqah ibn Nawfal.\n\nAs for the Prophet’s supposed meeting with the monk Bahirah, it happened when he was twelve years old. From a historical point of view, this story is odd, as was mentioned by adh-Dhahabi and other scholars.\n\nMoreover, even if we assume that this story is proven, it does not lead to the conclusion that the missionaries intended, because this meeting was so brief that it would not be possible for a person to learn anything in such a short time, let alone acquire great, important and weighty information like the revelation that he brought later on.\n\nAs for the Prophet’s meeting with Waraqah ibn Nawfal, it does not make sense – from a rational point of view – to quote it as evidence that Waraqah was a teacher of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) only met Waraqah after the first verses of the Quran were revealed. Moreover, Waraqah himself affirmed the prophethood of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and wished to live long enough to lend great support to him. But Waraqah died shortly after that.\n\nThis is all that happened when they met.\nIn fact, the claim that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) acquired knowledge from the People of the Book when he was in Makkah is a claim that is disproven by the academic and cultural status of Makkah and the true nature of the connection this Arab society had with the knowledge of the People of the Book.\nChristianity had become deeply immersed in idolatry and misguidance, and its followers had become arrogant, as they were described by Isaac Taylor.\nBell said: “There is no strong proof to suggest that Christianity had any centre in the Hijaz, or near Makkah, or even in Madinah, and [people in Arabia] knew very little about the knowledge of the People of the Book. How could such little knowledge enable the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to acquire such vast and precise knowledge of the stories of the People of the Book?\nSixthly:\nAfter proving that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not learn the knowledge of the People of the Book from them directly or through an intermediary, we have no option left except to affirm that it was revelation from Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, to His chosen Prophet.\nThe Quran establishes proof of its divine origin by telling stories of the Prophets and past nations that it mentions:\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{You were not there on the western side [of the mountain] when We decreed for Musa the commission, nor did you witness that event.\nBut We brought forth many nations [after Musa], and a long time has gone by since then. And you [O Muhammad] did not dwell among the people of Madyan, learning from them [the story mentioned in] Our revelation; rather it is We Who have sent you as a Messenger [and revealed to you their stories]}[al-Qasas 28:44-45]\n{This is an account of the unseen [the distant past], which We reveal to you [O Muhammad]; neither you nor your people had any knowledge of it before this. So be patient, for the best outcome is for those who fear Allah}[Hud 11:49]\n{This is an account of the unseen [the distant past], which We reveal to you [O Muhammad]; you were not with them when they cast lots with their pens, [to decide] who, from among them, should be the guardian of Maryam. Nor were you with them when they disputed about it}[Al ‘Imran 3:44].\nSuch verses affirm the prophethood of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and affirm that these stories are revelation from Allah, may He be glorified and exalted.\nImam Abu Ja‘far an-Nahhas says: “Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, stated that as proof of his prophethood for Quraysh, because he did not know how to write and he did not mix with the People of the Book, and there were no People of the Book in Makkah, but he brought them stories of the previous prophets and nations.” End quote from I‘rab al-Quran (3/76).\nThus we see that when the stubborn people rejected the prophethood of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and rejected the divine origin of the Quran, they failed to explain where the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) learned the stories and knowledge of the People of the Book. Hence they resorted to fabrications in an attempt to conceal the light of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, so that it would not reach the eyes of seekers.\nPraise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds.\nReferences:\n1.

240235,"Is it obligatory for my husband to give me pocket money, some of which I can save, because he does not want me to work outside the house? As I have no way to help my widowed mother, because I have no income myself.","['Praise be to Allah.The husband is not obliged to spend on his wife’s mother; rather he is obliged to spend on his wife and his household members on a reasonable basis.\nBut he should be generous to his wife’s family, and help them if they are in need, even if that comes under the heading of his charitable giving or zakah.\nThis is emphasised even more in this case, if his wife’s mother has no one to spend on her, as mentioned in the question.\nIf the wife knows that her husband would willingly give some things, such as food and similar things that people are usually easy-going about, there is nothing wrong with her giving such things to her mother, in a way that will not affect her own household costs, even if she does not clearly ask her husband for permission, so long as she thinks it most likely that he will overlook such things and will not prevent her from doing it.

Because of my 2 pregnancies, I gained weight and that's why he said and he cheated on me , I forgave him, and we had after that a much better marriage but without intimacy. I always have to help him with oral sex but I also really need intimacy. I already lost a lot of weight, I always make myself beautiful for him, I know I'm beautiful. I do everything for Allah and for him and for my children, he says there is no better or beautiful wife than me, but he doesn't touch me, I tried everything. He says that it is not me but he is tired from his job. My feelings started to become less, he had a long beard, now it is so short. I always talk about Islam with him, he says that he is so proud of me. But he hurt me so many times through our marriage, we also still don't live together and it's killing me. It 's such a long story, khayr in sha Allah.
I want love and intimacy, I want to feel beautiful and loved and ...He is a good man, like he is sweet and calm and gives me everything I need, but the most important thing I don't have with him.
What must I do, and do you have any advice for him?
If I have to give you more information, I will do that.","[""Praise be to Allah.Wife’s right to intimacy\nThere is no doubt that what you mention is very difficult for a young woman. A woman may be able to do without her husband spending on her or providing her with accommodation, clothing or other material needs. She may be able to do without all of that, by spending from her own wealth or her family’s wealth or whatever… But she has no way to maintain her chastity and fulfil her physical desire except her husband, or by means that Allah has forbidden – Allah forbid that she should think of that or be tested in that way.\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about a man who stayed away from his wife for a month or two months and did not have intercourse with her; was there any sin on him or not? Could the husband be asked to do that? \xa0\nHe replied:\xa0\n“The husband is obliged to have intercourse with his wife on a reasonable basis, which is one of the most important rights that she has over him; it is more important than feeding her. It was said that what is obligatory with regard to intercourse is once every four months, or according to her need and his ability, just as he should feed her according to her need and his ability. And the latter is the more correct opinion.” (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 32/271)\xa0\nMuslim narrated (1006) from Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “…the intimacy of one of you (with his wife) is a charity.” They said: O Messenger of Allah, if one of us fulfils his desire, will he be rewarded for that? He said: “Do you not see that if he did it in a haram manner, there would be a burden of sin on him for that? Similarly, if he does it in a halal manner, he will be rewarded for it.”\xa0\nIn that case, what the wise husband must do is take care of his wife in that regard and give it priority over everything else, so that he may keep her chaste, conceal her and meet her needs as much as he can, even if he does not have an urgent need for that and even if he had to do it only for her, for the sake of meeting his wife’s needs. In that there will be reward for both of them, in sha Allah, and a means of help so that they attain spiritual and worldly wellbeing.\nAddressing long periods of Abstinence\nThere is no doubt that what you mentioned about your husband’s situation and that having gone on for a long time without him satisfying your needs but doing his duty towards you, is\xa0\nIf the matter is as you say, that you have not fallen short in your duties towards your husband of adorning yourself for him, endearing yourself to him and being prepared to meet your husband’s needs, then we think that you, along with your husband, should look at two things:\xa0\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Make sure that there is no medical problem that is preventing your husband from doing that, whether it is a psychological problem, as often happens, or a physical problem. We think that the possibility of this is not very strong, because of what you mentioned about your husband doing that with you, even if it is not frequent, and even his falling into that which is haram, even though he is married to you!\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Make sure that you close all avenues to your husband fulfilling his desire, except with his wife. It is natural that if your husband has got used to other ways that are prohibited, such as masturbation, or immoral relationships – Allah forbid – or ways that are permissible, such as fulfilling his desire with his wife without having intercourse, then it is natural that this will weaken his desire to have intercourse with his wife. If he has got used to these ways, perhaps what that means is that he is able to do without his wife altogether, no matter how beautiful she is or what she does for him.\xa0\nIn that case, we advise you to give up all ways that may lead to that. What you mention about oral sex is one of the causes of the problem and is not a solution to it. So fulfil your husband’s needs in all permissible ways and adorn yourself for him, and ensure that fulfilling desires is done by means of some shared action that will fulfil the rights of both parties and allow each to fulfil the duties that Allah has enjoined towards the other.\xa0\nThat also involves making sure that your husband does not repeat the prohibited action that he admitted to you and that he has repented from that action. Try to keep him away from that as much as possible, even if that is by changing the environment and the place where you live, if you are able to do that.\xa0\nRight to divorce if husband does not fulfil wife’s right to intimacy\nIf you do that and make the effort, but your husband does not change, and he continues to fail to fulfil your rights and keep you chaste by means of that which Allah has permitted, there is no doubt that the suffering in that case is something that carries weight in Shari`ah. So if you cannot put up with your husband anymore and you fear that you may fall into prohibited relations or think of it, then you can ask for separation from your husband. Perhaps if he sees that the matter is serious, he will mend his ways, and if he goes ahead and divorces you, perhaps Allah will replace him with someone who is better than him and grant you someone who will keep you chaste. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“But if they separate (by divorce), Allah will provide abundance for everyone of them from His Bounty. And Allah is Ever All-Sufficient for His creatures' needs, All-Wise.” [An-Nisa 4:130]\nBut as you know, this should be the last resort.\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Causing harm to the wife by not having intercourse is grounds for annulment in all cases, whether the husband did that intentionally or otherwise, and whether he was able to do it or not; it is like maintenance, and even more important.” (Al-Fatawa Al-Kubra, 5/481-482)\xa0\nWe ask Allah to set things straight between you and your husband, and to endear him to you and you to him, and to reconcile between you.\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 193320 , 826 , 2487 , 166912 , 2300 , 10680 , 43166 , and 23390 .\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/174648/my-husband-doesnt-satisfy-me-sexually-what-should-i-do-in-islam
