296830,What is the ruling on calling a Facebook group “An hour for the Lord and an hour for yourself”? Is there any reason to be uncomfortable about this phrase?,"['Praise be to Allah.If what is meant by the one who says this is that people need time\xa0 for relaxation and joy in some permissible ways, in order to rest and have a break from striving for worldly aims and from striving for the hereafter, so that people will not become exhausted from constant striving and will be re-energized to resume their efforts and striving for what will benefit them in this world and the hereafter – if this is what is meant by the one who says this, that is a sound meaning and there does not seem to be anything wrong with this phrase.\nIt is similar in meaning to what is mentioned in the famous sahih hadith:\nIt was narrated that Hanzalah said: We were with the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and he exhorted us and reminded us of the Fire. Then I came home and laughed with my children and played with my wife. Then I went out and met Abu Bakr, and I mentioned that to him. He said: I have done the same as you mentioned. We met the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and I said: O Messenger of Allah, Hanzalah has become a hypocrite.\nHe said: “Don’t speak like that.”\nSo I told him what we had said, and Abu Bakr said: I have done the same as he has.\nHe said: “O Hanzalah, there is a time for this and a time for that. If your hearts were always as they are when you are remembering Allah (dhikr), the angels would shake hands with you in the streets and greet you.”\xa0Narrated by Muslim (2750).\nThis hadith highlights the virtue of persisting in dhikr (remembering Allah) and doing righteous deeds, and that it is permissible to stop doing that sometimes in order to do things that bring joy, so as to avoid exhaustion.\nIbn al-Jawzi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe words “there is a time for this and a time for that” mean that there is a time for being alert and focused (on dhikr and righteous deeds) and a time for doing permissible things (by way of relaxation), even if that could lead to lack of focus on dhikr and worship. That is because if someone keeps striving without pause, he will not last. So the one who is focused on dhikr and worship has no choice but to deal with things that will distract him from that, in order to maintain a good balance. How could a person be able to eat, drink and have marital relations if he thinks about matters of the hereafter as if he is seeing them with his own eyes? In being distracted from that there is a great benefit, but if it increases, it will cause trouble. Rather it should be of appropriate proportions.""(Kashshaf al-Mushkil\xa0 4/229-230).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“O Hanzalah, there is a time for this and a time for that” means a time for the Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, and a time for one’s family and children, and a time for oneself that will give you space to breathe and relax, and give those who have rights their rights.\nThis is an example of the justice and perfection of Islam. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has rights, so He should be given his rights. A person’s own self has rights and must be given its rights. A man’s family have rights and they must be given their rights. Visitors and guests have rights and must be given their rights. In this way the individual will be able to fulfil all the duties he owes with ease, and he will be able to worship Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, with ease, because if he overburdens himself and is too strict with himself, he will grow tired and weary, and will neglect many of his duties.""(Sharh Riyad as-Salihin\xa02/236).\nThis is the correct understanding of this phrase: time spent worshipping Allah, may He be exalted, and reflecting on matters of the hereafter, and time spent in permissible things and fulfilling one’s duties towards oneself and others, so that the Muslim will be able to do all the duties that are required of him, and will be energized to do his duties by this time spent in doing permissible things.\nAl-Bukhari (1968) narrated from ‘Awn ibn Abi Juhayfah, from his father, who said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) established the bond of brotherhood between Salman and Abu’d-Darda’. Salman visited Abud-Darda’ and saw Umm’d-Darda’ looking unkempt. He said to her: What is the matter with you? She said: Your brother Abu’d-Darda’ has no need of worldly matters. Abu’d-Darda’ came and made some food for him. Salman said: Eat (with me). Abu’d-Darda’ said: I am fasting. Salman said: I will not eat until you eat – so Abu’d-Darda’ ate. When night came, Abu’d-Darda’ went to get up (to pray) and Salman said: Sleep, so he slept. Then he went to get up again and Salman said: Sleep. Then towards the end of the night, Salman said: Now get up – and they prayed.\nSalman said to him: Your Lord has a right over you, your own self has a right over you, and your wife has a right over you, so give each one who has a right their due rights.\nThen he came to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and told him about that, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Salman has spoken the truth.”\xa0\xa0\nIf this is what is meant by calling the group by this name, there does not seem to be anything wrong with it, and what is meant is that a person will spend some time with his friends, talking to them and exchanging ideas with them, and chatting about permissible things for the purpose of relaxation, so that he will then be able to focus on his worship after that with energy.\nOne of the conditions stipulated regarding that is that the time spent with this group should be short and should fulfil the purpose of warding off boredom, and no more than that. If it is done more than that, it will become harmful and will be a waste of time, and it will be detrimental to the individual and will be of no benefit to him.\nBut if the one who says that is someone who spends most of his time in idle pursuits, playing and messing about, and he regards the time spent on each as being the same and – not only that – he also does what idle people do, who spend most of their time in playing and messing around, this is detrimental to both religious and worldly interests; it is foolishness and bad judgement.\nHowever, it should be noted that some people say these words and what they mean is a time for worship and a time for doing whatever they want of playing and messing about – even if it is in prohibited matters. This is not permissible at all, for the Muslim is enjoined to avoid what Allah has prohibited at all times. All that is acceptable is having some time to have a break, in which he can ward off boredom and fatigue by doing some permissible things, not what is prohibited.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/296830/the-saying-an-hour-for-the-lord-and-an-hour-for-yourself
222910,"I am afraid of the rebellious jinn and the devils, and I am afraid of the dark. Every time there is any talk about the jinn, my heart almost leaves my chest and I go into a severe panic, especially","['Praise be to Allah.What you must do is gain courage by remembering Allah and always obeying Him. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {Those who have believed and whose hearts are assured by the remembrance of Allah. Unquestionably, by the remembrance of Allah hearts are assured} [ar-Ra‘d 13:28].\nSo fortify yourself with remembrance of Allah, especially the adhkar that are to be recited morning and evening, and the adhkar that are to be recited when going to sleep and when entering the bathroom. And recite Surat al-Baqarah often in your house, for the Shaytan flees from the house in which Surat al-Baqarah is recited.\nYou should understand that the scheme of the Shaytan is weak, and he is much more insignificant than you think. In fact, Allah has limited his scheming to whispers (waswasah), so when you are afraid of something, seek help against it by remembering Allah and turning to Him, for He is the best protector.\nIt was narrated that ‘Uthman ibn ‘Affan (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said:\n“There is no one who says every morning and every evening ‘Bismillah illadhi la yadurru ma‘a ismihi shay’un fi’l-ardi wa la fi’s-sama’ wa huwa as-sami‘ al-‘alim (In the Name of Allah, with whose name nothing on earth or in heaven can cause harm, and He is the All-Hearing, All-Knowing)’ three times, but nothing will harm him.”\nIt is a sahih hadith which was narrated by at-Tirmidhi (3388), who said: A sahih hasah hadith; it was also classed as sahih by al-Albani.\nIt was narrated from Khawlah bint Hakeem as-Sulamiyyah that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever makes a stop on a journey and says, ‘A‘udhu bi kalimat Allah il-tammati min sharri ma khalaqa (I seek refuge in the perfect words of Allah from the evil of that which He has created),’ nothing will harm him until he moves on from that place.”\xa0Narrated by Muslim, 2708 and others.\nA man asked ‘Abd ar-Rahman ibn Khanbash: What did the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) do when the devils schemed against him?\nJibril (peace be upon him) taught the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to seek refuge with Allah from the evil of the devils and the rebellious jinn by saying:\nA‘udhu bi kalimat illah it-tammat illatī la yujawizuhunna barrun wa la fajirun min sharri ma khalaq, wa dhara\'a wa bara\'a, wa min sharri ma yanzilu min as-sama\', wa min sharri ma ya‘ruju fīha, wa min sharri ma dhara\'a fi’l-arḍ, wa min sharri ma yakhruju minha, wa min sharri fitan il-layli wa’n-nahar, wa min sharri kulli tariqin illa tariqan yatruqu bikhayrin ya Rahman (I seek refuge in the Perfect Words of Allah, which neither the righteous nor the evil may overcome, from the evil of what He created, of what He scattered and what He made, from the evil of what descends from the heavens, and of what ascends to them, from the evil of what He scattered in the earth, and of what emerges from it, from the evil trials of night and day, and from the evil of every night visitor, except the night visitor who comes with good, O Merciful Gracious).\nA sahih hadith, narrated by Ahmad (15035) and others; classed as sahih by al-Albani.\nIt was narrated by ‘Abdullah ibn Khubayb that his father said: I was with the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on the road to Makkah, and I had the opportunity to be alone with the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). I draw close to him and he said: “Speak.”\nI said: What should I say?\nHe said: “Speak.”\nI said: What should I say?\nHe said: “Say: {Qul a‘udhu bi rabbi l falaq (Say, ""I seek refuge in the Lord of daybreak)} until you complete the surah, then say {Qul a‘udhu bi Rabb in-nas (Say, ""I seek refuge in the Lord of mankind)} until you complete the surah.” Then he said: “The people will not seek refuge with Allah with anything better than these two.”\nA sahih hadith, narrated by an-Nasa’i (5429) and others; classed as sahih by al-Albani.\nYou should be careful lest the Shaytan prevent you from doing acts of worship or praying in congregation by scaring you and making you afraid. For all that he wants is to prevent you from praying in congregation, then Allah knows best what else he could lead you to of evil or prevent you from doing of good after that.\nMay Allah make you steadfast, give you courage, reassure you and avert from you the schemes, temptations and whispers of the Shaytan.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/222910/he-is-afraid-of-the-dark-because-he-is-terrified-of-the-jinn-how-can-he-rid-himself-of-this-fear
111881,What is the reason why divorce is in the husband’s hands? What is the ruling on one who divorces his wife for no reason?,"[""Praise be to Allah.Why Is Divorce in the Husband's Hands?\nShaykh Muhammad ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“The reason why divorce is in the man’s hand is justice because the husband is the one in whose hand is the marriage contract, so he is the one in whose hand is the dissolution of this contract.\xa0\nAnd because the husband is in charge of the woman, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allah has made one of them to excel the other”\xa0[al-Nisa’ 4:34].\xa0\nAs he is in charge, then the matter is in his hands. This is what is implied by common sense. \xa0\nAnd because the man is more perfect in reason than the woman, and more far-sighted, so you do not see him choosing to divorce unless he sees that there is no alternative. But if it were in the wife’s hand, the wife is lacking in reason and is less far-sighted, and she is quick to become emotional. She may be impressed by some man and hasten to divorce her husband, because she has seen someone who is more attractive to her, so she prefers him to her husband. There are other reasons, but these three reasons that I have mentioned are among the most important reasons why divorce is in the husband’s hands.”\xa0\nCan a man divorce his wife for any reason?\nShaykh Muhammad ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) also said:\n“With regard to the ruling on one who divorces his wife for no reason , the scholars say that the five rulings apply to divorce, i.e., it may be obligatory, or it may be prohibited, or it may be recommended, or it may be disliked, or it may be permissible.\xa0\nThe basic principle is that divorce is not desirable, because it is dissolving the bonds of marriage which Islam encourages and promotes, and because a great deal of harm may result from it, such as if the woman has children from the husband – this divorce will result in splitting up of the family and the problems that result from that.\nIf there is a need for divorce because it is not possible for the spouses to live together happily, then in that case it is permissible, and it is a blessing from Allah, I mean it being permissible in that case, because if the couple were to remain in a life of misery and suffering, this world would be unbearable for them. But by the blessing of Allah, if there is a need for it, then it is permissible.”\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/111881/why-is-divorce-in-the-husbands-hands
