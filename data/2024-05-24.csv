276445,Is there a difference between a nabi (prophet) and a rasul (messenger)?,"['Praise be to Allah.The scholars differed regarding that. Some of them said that there is no difference between a nabi and a rasul, and others said that there is a difference between a nabi and a rasul.\nThe latter is the correct view, because the basic principle in speech is to establish ideas, not to repeat ideas for the purpose of emphasis.\nAbu’l-Baqa’ al-Kafawi said in al-Kulliyyat (p.1065): Establishing ideas is more important than repeating ideas for the purpose of emphasis, because establishing new ideas is better than mere repetation. End quote.\nThen the scholars differed with regard to how these differences are to be defined and explained.\nThe most well-known view is that a nabi and a rasul both receive revelation, but the rasul is commanded by Allah to convey it, whereas the nabi is not commanded to convey it.\nAl-Khattabi said in A‘lam al-Hadith (1/298): The difference between the nabi and the rasul is that the nabi is the one who is told or informed about things, whereas the rasul is the one who is enjoined to convey what he is told and informed about. Hence every rasul is a nabi but not every nabi is a rasul. End quote.\nIbn Hajar said in Fath al-Bari (11/112): al-Qurtubi said, following the view of others: This is proof for those who do not allow the transmission of hadiths on the basis of meaning, and it is the correct view among the Malikis, because the words nabi and rasul come from different roots.\nThe word nabi comes from the root naba’, which refers to news. Thus the nabi is the one who is told by Allah a command that becomes like an obligation. If he is commanded to convey [what he is told] to others, then he is a rasul, otherwise he is a nabi and not a rasul. Based on that, every rasul is a nabi, but the opposite is not the case. Thus the nabi and the rasul have something in common, which is receiving news, but they differ with regard to conveying the message. So if you say that So and so is a rasul, this implies that he is a nabi and rasul; but if you say that So and so is a nabi, this does not imply that he is a rasul. End quote.\nIbn al-Mulaqqin said in al-Mu‘in ‘ala Tafahhum al-Arba‘in (p. 39): Rusul is the plural of rasul, which refers to the one who is commanded to convey the revelation to people; this is more specific than the word nabi. Thus he [the rasul] is the one who receives revelation to act upon and convey, in contrast to the nabi, who receives revelation to act upon it only. End quote.\nSome of the scholars say that both receive revelation and both are commanded to convey it, but the rasul has a book from Allah. Other scholars say that the rasul is the one to whom a book comes down, or to whom an angel comes, whereas the nabi is the one who receives revelation, or follows another rasul.\nAl-‘Ayni said in al-Binayah Sharh al-Hidayah (1/116): The difference between the rasul and the nabi is that the rasul is the one who is sent to convey the revelation and has a book, whereas the nabi is the one who is sent to convey revelation in general terms, either with or without a book. This was stated by Shaykh Qawwam ad-Din al-Atrazi in his Sharh…\nThen he said: The correct view in this case is that the rasul is the one to whom a book comes down, or an angel comes to him, whereas the nabi is the one whom Allah, may He be exalted, informs of the rulings, or he follows another rasul. End quote.\nPerhaps the best that may be said concerning this matter is:\nThe nabi and rasul have in common the fact that they both receive revelation. This is indicated by the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Indeed, We have revealed to you, [O Muhammad], as We revealed to Noah and the prophets after him. And we revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, the Descendants, Jesus, Job, Jonah, Aaron, and Solomon, and to David We gave the book [of Psalms]}\xa0[an-Nisa’ 4:163].\nThey also have in common the fact that they are both commanded to convey the message, as mentioned in the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And We did not send before you any messenger or prophet except that when he spoke [or recited], Satan threw into it [some misunderstanding]. But Allah abolishes that which Satan throws in; then Allah makes precise His verses. And Allah is Knowing and Wise}\xa0[Al-Hajj 22:52].\nShaykh ash-Shinqiti said in Adwa’ al-Bayan (5/290): This verse of Soorat al-Hajj indicates that what is commonly known among the people of knowledge, that the nabi is the one who receives revelation and is not enjoined to convey it, whereas the rasul is the nabi who receives revelation and is commanded to convey what is revealed to him, is not correct, because the words {And We did not send before you any messenger or prophet …} indicate that both are sent, but there is some difference between them.\nSome of the scholars suggested that the nabi who is also a rasul is the one to whom a book and an independent system of law are sent down, in addition to miracles which prove that he is a true prophet, whereas the nabi who is sent, who is different from a rasul, is the one to whom no book is sent down; rather he receives revelation telling him to call people to the system of law of the rasul who came before him. An example of that is the Israelite prophets who were sent and instructed to act in accordance with the Torah, as Allah, may He be exalted, states in the verse (interpretation of the meaning): {The prophets who submitted [to Allah ] judged by it\xa0…} [al-Ma’idah 5:44]. End quote.\nThe rasul and nabi differ in that the rasul is enjoined to convey the message to one of the disbelieving nations. As for the nabi, he is enjoined to convey the message and call people, without having a separate message for a new nation among those who reject the truth.\nShaykh al-Islam said in an-Nubuwwat (2/714): The nabi is the one to whom Allah sends revelation, which carries a message from Allah. If, in addition to that, he is sent to those who go against the command of Allah, to convey a message from Allah to them, then he is a rasul.\nBut if he is sent to implement the system of law that came before him, and he is not sent to anyone to convey a message from Allah to him, then he is a nabi, and not a rasul. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {And We did not send before you any messenger or prophet except that when he spoke [or recited], Satan threw into it [some misunderstanding]} [Al-Hajj 22:52].\nThe words {any messenger or prophet} mention the idea of sending in general terms, which includes both types. One of them is called a rasul, which refers to a messenger in a general sense whom Allah instructs to convey His message to those who opposed Him, such as Nuh. It is affirmed in the sahih hadiths that he was the first messenger (rasul) sent to the people of Earth, and that before him there were prophets (anbiya’), such as Shith and Idris (peace be upon them), and before them there was Adam, to whom Allah spoke directly. Ibn ‘Abbas said: Between Adam and Nuh there were ten generations, each of whom followed Islam.\nThose prophets (anbiya’) received revelation from Allah telling them what they should do, and they instructed the believers who followed them to do the same, because they believed in them, just as the followers of a system of law accept what the scholars convey from the rasul.\nAnother example of that is the Israelite prophets, who enjoined the system of law of the Torah, one of whom might receive revelation specifically for him to keep to himself and not convey, regarding a specific incident. But with regard to the Torah system of law, they were like scholars whom Allah enabled to work out an issue in the light of the Torah, just as Allah enables Muslim scholars to understand some matter in accordance with the Quran, and Allah enabled Sulayman to work out a ruling on the matter that he judged along with Dawud.\nThus Allah informed the prophets (anbiya’) of His commands and prohibitions, and other matters, and they told those who believed in them what Allah told them of news, commands and prohibitions.\nBut if they were sent to the disbelievers to call them to affirm Allah’s oneness and worship Him alone, with no partner or associate, there would inevitably be some people who would reject and deny the messengers (rusul). Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Similarly, there came not to those before them any messenger except that they said, “A magician or a madman”}[adh-Dhariyat 51:52]\n{Nothing is said to you, [O Muhammad], except what was already said to the messengers before you}[Fussilat 41:43].\nThe messengers (rusul) were sent to people who opposed the divine message, and some of them rejected that message. Allah says:\n{And We sent not before you [as messengers] except men to whom We revealed from among the people of cities. So have they not traveled through the earth and observed how was the end of those before them? And the home of the Hereafter is best for those who fear Allah; then will you not reason?\n\xa0[They continued] until, when the messengers despaired and were certain that they had been denied, there came to them Our victory, and whoever We willed was saved. And Our punishment cannot be repelled from the people who are criminals}[Yusuf 12:109-110]\n{Indeed, We will support Our messengers and those who believe during the life of this world and on the Day when the witnesses will stand}\xa0[Ghafir 40:51].\nThe verse {And We did not send before you any messenger or prophet …} [al-Hajj 22:52] indicates that the nabi is sent, but is not usually called a rasul, because he was not sent to people with something that they did not know. Rather he would enjoin the believers to adhere to what they knew to be true, as a scholar does.\nHence the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The scholars are the heirs of the prophets.” It is not stipulated that a rasul should bring a new system of law; Yusuf followed the path of Ibrahim, and Dawud and Sulayman were messengers (rasul), although they followed the system of law of the Torah. And Allah, may He be exalted, tells us that the believer of the household of Pharaoh said (interpretation of the meaning):\n{“And Joseph had already come to you before with clear proofs, but you remained in doubt of that which he brought to you, until when he died, you said, ‘Never will Allah send a messenger after him.’}\xa0[Ghafir 40:34].\nEnd quote.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/276445/the-difference-between-a-nabi-prophet-and-a-rasul-messenger
323358,"If you cannot weep during prayer, should you make yourself weep?","['Praise be to Allah.Weeping during prayer is one of the outcomes of humble submission (khushu‘) in prayer, and Allah, may He be exalted, praises those who are humbly submissive in their prayer, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Certainly will the believers have succeeded,\nThey who are during their prayer humbly submissive}\xa0[Al-Mu’minun 23:1-2].\nIbn Juzayy (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Humble submission (khushu‘) is a state of heart, which results from fear of Allah, awareness that Allah is watching and humility before the greatness of the Lord, may He be glorified and exalted. The impact of that is seen in the limbs, which become still, and also includes focusing on the prayer, not looking around, weeping, and beseeching.""(Tafsir ibn Juzayy\xa0 2/48).\nHence weeping during prayer stems from fear of Allah, which is something prescribed and required. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And they fall upon their faces weeping, and the Qur’an increases them in humble submission}\xa0[Al-Isra’ 17:109].\nAl-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The word {weeping} indicates that it is permissible to weep during prayer out of fear of Allah, may He be exalted, or because of having disobeyed Allah, and that does not interrupt the prayer or detract from it.""(Tafsir al-Qurtubi\xa0 10/342).\nIt is soundly narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his companions that they used to weep during prayer out of fear of Allah.\nIt was narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn ash-Shikhkhir (m ay Allah be pleased with him) said: I came to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) when he was praying and his sobbing sounded like water boiling in a pot – meaning that he was weeping. Narrated by an-Nasa’i (1214); classed as sahih by al-Albani.\nIt was narrated from ‘A’ishah, the Mother of the Believers, that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said during his final sickness: “Tell Abu Bakr to lead the people in prayer.” ‘A’ishah said: If Abu Bakr stands in your place, he will not be able to make the people hear him because of his weeping, so tell ‘Umar to lead the people in prayer… Narrated by al-Bukhari (716).\nThis weeping is one of the outcomes of humble submission (khushu‘), but not weeping does not mean that one has not attained humble submission. Many of the Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) described the Prophet’s prayer without mentioning that he wept during it, and he is the foremost of those who fear Allah and submit humbly to Him.\nAt-Tabari narrated that Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said regarding the verse {They who are during their prayer humbly submissive} [al-Mu’minun 23:2]: They are filled with fear of Allah and are calm. Tafsir at-Tabari (17/10).\nShaykh al-Amin ash-Shinqiti (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The root meaning of the word khushu‘ (translated here as humble submission) is stillness and calmness, and a physical posture that is indicative of humility.\nIn Islamic terminology, it refers to fear of Allah in the heart, the impact of which is seen in the limbs and physical posture.""(Adwa’ al-Bayan\xa0 5/825).\nSecondly:\nThe type of weeping that is praiseworthy is that which overcomes a person because of his softheartedness and his humble submission in his prayer, and when he hears the verses of Allah being recited to him.\nThe one who is not able to weep should not miss out on reflecting [on the meaning of the verses recited] or on humble submission in his heart resulting in stillness of his limbs, because there is no connection between the two. The heart may be humbly submissive, without there being tears in the eyes, or there may be tears in the eyes, but no humble submission in the heart, which is the worst of states, Allah forbid.\nRegarding the hadith, “This Qur’an was sent down with sorrow, so when you read it, then weep, and if you do not weep, make yourself weep” (narrated by Ibn Majah, 1337), it is a da‘if (weak) hadith and is not sahih (sound). Al-Busayri said: This isnad includes Abu Rafi‘, whose name is Isma‘il ibn Rafi‘; he is da‘if (weak) and matruk (his hadith is to be rejected). Misbah az-Zujajah fi Zawa’id Ibn Majah (1/157). It was also classed as da‘if by al-Albani.\nIf we assume that the hadith is sahih, what is meant by making oneself weep is having focus in the heart and making oneself feel sorrow; it does not mean making artificial sounds to resemble weeping. That is a kind of effort that is not allowed; rather some of the scholars have stated that deliberately making sounds that resemble weeping invalidates the prayer.\nAl-Fayyumi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Ibn ‘Abbas said: If a person recites the verse in al-Isra’ in which there is a sajdah (v. 109), do not hasten to prostrate unless you are weeping, and if the eyes of one of you are not weeping, then let him make his heart weep. The way to make oneself weep is to bring sorrow into one’s heart.""(Fath al-Qarib al-Mujib ‘ala at-Targhib wa’t-Tarhib\xa07/121).\nShaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: What is the ruling on making oneself weep? And how sound are the reports that were narrated concerning that?\nHe replied: In some hadiths it says that if you do not weep, then make yourself weep, but I do not know how sound that is… What appears to be the case is that one should not put effort into making oneself weep; rather if a person finds himself weeping, he should try hard not to disturb others, and his weeping should be quiet; he should avoid disturbing others as much as possible.""(Majmu‘ Fatawa wa Maqalat\xa0 11/347).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\xa0 What is the ruling on making oneself weep loudly during congregational prayers in the mosque in order to create an atmosphere of humble submission (khushu‘)?\nHe replied: Making oneself cry artificially – as some people do – is not prescribed in Islamic teachings.\nAs for that weeping which stems from humble submission in the heart, bringing to mind the greatness of the Lord and fearing Him, this is something that is prescribed, and if a person makes a sound involuntarily, without making himself do that, there is nothing wrong with that.\nBut pretending to weep is something that is not prescribed and is not appropriate; rather what is required is to reflect on the words of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, with sincerity and understanding the meaning. Then if a person’s heart softens as a result of that and becomes humbly submissive, and he weeps when punishment is mentioned out of fear of it, and when reward is mentioned out of hope for it, and when the Lord is mentioned out of reverence towards Him, and when the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his story are mentioned out of love towards him and longing to meet him, that is a good thing.""(Al-Liqa’ ash-Shahri\xa0 5/8).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/323358/is-it-prescribed-in-islam-to-make-oneself-weep-during-prayer

If a Muslim cannot do one act of worship, he may strive hard in those acts of worship that he can do, until Allah makes it easy for him to do the acts of worship that he could not do.\xa0\nBy the bounty of Allah towards His believing slaves, if a person resolves to do an act of worship but he is unable to do it because of some excuse, he will be granted the reward of one who does it. Al-Bukhari (4423) narrated from Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came back from the campaign of Tabuk and when he drew close to Madinah he said: “In Madinah there are some people who, whenever you marched or crossed a valley, were with you.” They said: “O Messenger of Allah, but they were in Madinah.” He said, “They were in Madinah because some excuse kept them back.”\xa0\nThe scholars of the Standing Committee said: \xa0\n“A woman who does not have a Mahram does not have to do Hajj , because in her case a Mahram is part of being able to do Hajj, and being able to do it is one of the conditions of Hajj being obligatory.

Malik, Ash-Shafi`i and Al-Awza`i held a different opinion and each of them stipulated a condition (allowing her to do that), but with no evidence. Ibn Al-Mundhir said: they did not follow the apparent meaning of the Hadith, and each of them stipulated a condition (allowing her to do that), but with no evidence.” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah lil-Buhuth Al-`Ilmiyyah wal-‘Ifta’, 11/90, 91)\xa0\nAnd they said:\xa0\n“If the situation is as described – that it is not easy for your husband or a Mahram of yours to travel with you to perform the obligation of Hajj – then you are not obliged to do it so long as this is the case, because the accompaniment of your husband or Mahram on the journey for Hajj is one of the conditions of Hajj being obligatory for you. It is prohibited for you to travel for Hajj or for any other purpose without that, even if you go with your brother’s wife and a group of women, according to the correct scholarly view, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “No woman should travel except with a Mahram.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim).

484077,"I am a female obstetrician and gynaecologist (OB/GYN). Is my late father’s having spent on my education regarded as knowledge that will benefit him? Is it permissible for me to form the intention and dedicate the reward of my work to him, so that the reward for reducing the pain of my female patients, and protecting their ‘awrahs from being uncovered in front of male doctors, will reach him after he has died? Is this scenario included in the hadith, “When the son of Adam dies, his good deeds come to an end except three”– one of which is beneficial knowledge?","['Praise be to Allah.What your father did of spending on your education in this specialty will undoubtedly bring great reward, and what a father spends on his child is one of the greatest types of charity. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) stated that spending on one’s child brings great reward, and it takes precedence over other kinds of charity.\nIn the hadith it says that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The best dinar that a man spends is a dinar that he spends on his dependents, and a dinar that a man spends on his mount (for jihad) in Allah’s cause, and a dinar that he spends on his companions (in jihad) in Allah’s cause.”\nAbu Qilabah said: He started with the dependents. Then Abu Qilabah said: What man is greater in reward than a man who spends on young dependents and protects them from resorting to asking of people – or Allah benefits them through him – and makes them independent of means? Narrated by Muslim (994).\nSecondly:\nThe knowledge that you learned brings great benefit to Muslim women and provides them with medical treatment without having to see male doctors; this is one of the greatest benefits of which your father was a cause. It is known that a benefit that has far-reaching effect will bring reward to the one who initiated it, even if he did not have that particular intention in mind.\nSo we hope that there will be much good and great reward for your father for everyone who benefits from your treating them, because of his contribution and his being the cause of your education, without anything being detracted from your reward, in sha Allah.\nWhoever is the cause of some good deed being done will have a reward like that of the doer. It was narrated that Abu Mas‘ud al-Ansari said: A man came to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and said: My mount has died; give me a mount. He said: “I do not have anything.” A man said: O Messenger of Allah, I will tell him about someone who will give him a mount. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The one who tells another about a good deed is like the one who does it.” Narrated by Muslim (1893).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: [If someone does] deeds from which others benefit, he will be rewarded for benefitting others, even if he did not have that intention when he did that deed. Hence the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) stated that if someone sows a crop or plants a tree, and an animal eats from it or someone steals from it, he will be rewarded for that, even though he may have planted it without forming that intention; rather so long as people benefit from it, he will be rewarded for that.\nThis is also indicated by the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{No good is there in much of their private conversation, except for those who enjoin charity or that which is right or conciliation between people}\xa0[an-Nisa’ 4:114].\nThis indicates that if a person does that, even if it is simply to bring about reconciliation between people without seeking reward, there is goodness in that. Then Allah says:\n{And whoever does that seeking means to the approval of Allah - then We are going to give him a great reward}\xa0[an-Nisa’ 4:114].\nThis is something additional to the good which Allah mentions at the beginning of the verse.""(Liqa’ al-Bab al-Maftuh\xa0 32/9).\nWith regard to the hadith, “When a man dies, all his good deeds come to an end except three: ongoing charity (sadaqah jaariyah), beneficial knowledge, or a\xa0 righteous son who will pray for him” [narrated by Muslim 1631], what it refers to is whatever beneficial knowledge a person teaches to others from which people benefit. That includes beneficial worldly knowledge, foremost among which is medicine. Ash-Shafa‘i (may Allah have mercy on him) said: I do not know of any knowledge, after knowledge of what is halal and haram, that is more noble than medicine. End quote from Siyar A‘lam an-Nubala’ (10/57). Medicine is only of such high status because of what it contains of goodness and benefit, and because all people need it.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Regarding the hadith “When a man dies, all his good deeds come to an end except three: ongoing charity (sadaqah jaariyah), [and] beneficial knowledge…”, does this refer to Islamic knowledge or worldly knowledge?\nHe replied: What appears to be the case is that the hadith is general in meaning; any knowledge that is of benefit will earn that reward, but the foremost knowledge is Islamic knowledge. So if we assume that a man taught someone beneficial skills, and the one who learned that from him benefitted from learning it, then he will attain the reward and be rewarded for that.""(Liqa’ al-Bab al-Mahtuf\xa0 16/117).\nSo if someone teaches people beneficial worldly knowledge, he is included in the words of the hadith “or beneficial knowledge.” The same applies to the one who plays a role in conveying and spreading this knowledge and its benefits; there is the hope that he will also have a share of this reward, for the bounty of Allah is immense.\nIn the hadith narrated from ‘Uqbah ibn ‘Aamir (may Allah be pleased with him), he said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will admit three people to paradise by virtue of one arrow: the one who made it, intending good by making it, the one who shoots it, and the one who hands it to him.” Narrated by Ahmad in his Musnad (17300). The commentators said: The hadith is hasan when all its isnads and corroborating evidence are taken into account.\nThe scholars of the Permanent Committee for Ifta’ said: Printing useful books which benefit people regarding their religious and worldly affairs comes under the heading of the righteous deeds for which a person will be rewarded during his lifetime, and the reward and benefit thereof continue after he dies. That is included in the general meaning of the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) which are soundly narrated in the hadith of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When a man dies, all his good deeds come to an end except three: ongoing charity (sadaqah jaariyah), beneficial knowledge, or a\xa0 righteous son who will pray for him.” \xa0Narrated by Muslim in his Sahih. So anyone who plays a part in spreading this beneficial knowledge will attain this great reward, whether he is an author, a teacher, a publisher who distributes it to people, a designer, or one who plays a part in printing it.

82400,"What is the ruling on one who swears that his wife will be divorced if she does something such as severing the ties of kinship, and the husband is in a state of extreme anger at that point, and he is not in control of himself, to such an extent that he does not remember what he said?","['Praise be to Allah.Muslims should not take divorce lightly\nA man should not use divorce every time there is an argument between him and his wife, because of the negative consequences that result from divorce. Many men take the matter of divorce lightly and every time there is an argument between them and their wives, they swear to divorce them, and every time they have a disagreement with their friends, they swear to divorce their wives, and so on. This is a kind of toying with the Book of Allah, because the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) regarded the one who divorced his wife three times in one go as toying with the Book of Allah. So how about one who makes divorce his habit, and every time he wants to stop his wife doing something or urge her to do something he swears that he will divorce her?\xa0\nAn-Nasa’i (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated that Mahmud ibn Labid (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was told about a man who divorced his wife three times in one go. He got up angrily and said: “Will the Book of Allah be toyed with when I am still among you?”\xa0 A man stood up and said: “O Messenger of Allah, shall I kill him?” \xa0\nAl-Hafidh (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The men of its chain of narrators are trustworthy.” It was classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Ghayat Al-Maram (261).\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “These foolish men whose tongues utter the words of divorce for every issue, great or small, are going against the teachings of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) who said: “Whoever wants to swear an oath, let him swear by Allah or else remain silent.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 2679) If the believer wants to swear an oath, let him swear by Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. It is also not right to swear a great deal, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And protect your oaths (i.e. do not swear much).” [Al-Ma’idah 5:89]\nOne of the interpretations of this verse is that it means: do not swear a great deal.\xa0\nBut if they swear an oath of divorce, such as saying, “I will divorce you if you do such and such,” or “I will divorce you if you do not do such and such,” or “If you do such and such my wife will be divorced,” or “If you do not do such and such my wife will be divorced,” and other such phrases, these go against the teachings of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).” (Fatawa Al-Mar’ah Al-Muslimah, 2/753)\nIs conditional divorce valid?\nWhen a man says to his wife, “If you do such and such then you are divorced,” or, “If you do not so such and such then you are divorced,” this is a conditional divorce . The majority of jurists are of the view that this divorce counts as such when the condition mentioned is fulfilled.\xa0\nSome of the scholars – and this was the view favoured by Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) and others – were of the view that this condition is subject to further discussion, and it depends on the intention of the one who said it.\xa0\nIf he meant what is intended by the oath, which is to encourage someone to do something, or to stop someone from doing something, or to affirm something or deny something, then it comes under the ruling on oaths and no divorce takes place, but he must offer the expiation for breaking an oath when it is broken.\xa0\nIf he intended thereby to divorce his wife, then she is divorced when the condition is fulfilled. His intention is known only to Allah from Whom no secret is hidden. So the Muslim should beware of trying to deceive his Lord and of deceiving himself.\xa0\nThe Standing Committee was asked about a man who said to his wife: “Come with me or you are divorced,” and she did not go with him. Does that count as a divorce?\xa0\nThey replied:\xa0\n“If you did not intend that as a divorce and you only wanted to urge her to go with you, then that does not count as a divorce, but you have to offer the expiation for breaking an oath according to the more correct scholarly view. If you intended that to count as a divorce if she did not respond to you, then that counts as one divorce.” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 20/86)\xa0\nIs divorce in anger valid?\nIt should be noted that most cases of divorce occur at moments of anger , stress and agitation, not when one is feeling happy and relaxed. If a husband divorces his wife at a time of anger, that does not mean that the divorce does not count, as many people think, except if the anger reaches such an extent that the man loses his reason and is not aware of what he is saying, in which case it does not count as a divorce according to scholarly consensus.\xa0\nBut if it has not reached such an extent that he loses his reason, but the anger is so intense that the man is no longer in control of himself, then the majority of scholars are of the view that this anger does not mean that the divorce does not count.\xa0\nSome scholars are of the view that it does mean that the divorce does not count. This was the ruling issued by Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) and his student Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him), and it is the correct view in sha Allah. See the discussion on that in question no.\xa045174 . We have only referred to the view of the majority so that the questioner and readers may understand the seriousness of uttering the word of divorce, at times of anger and at other times. It may lead to the breakup of his family and to harm for himself and his family because of his haste and his unruly tongue. We ask Allah to keep us safe and sound.\xa0\nIf the oath that he swore concerning his wife happened when his anger had reached such an extent, then it does not count as a divorce, in sha Allah.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/82400/is-conditional-divorce-valid
