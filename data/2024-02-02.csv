467899,"My friend asked me for a favour to carry her luggage abroad, and I agreed. At the airport, I realized the weight limit has exceeded (due to misreading my ticket) and had to leave some items behind. In rush and illness, I forgot 3 items at the airport while sending back excess baggage. Unaware of this loss, I travelled and delivered the rest of her belongings, approximately 11-12 kgs of goods, to her.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIf someone is asked to transport some luggage and the like, this luggage is regarded as a trust under his care, and he is not liable for loss or damage unless he transgressed or was negligent, whether he is transporting it voluntarily or in return for payment. That is because in the case of one who is hired or appointed as a proxy, whatever is given to him to take care of is a trust (amanah).\nIt says in Sharh Muntaha al-Iradat (2/202): The proxy is in a position of trust. He is not liable if something is lost or damaged whilst in his care if he has not been negligent, because he is the proxy of the owner in possessing and disposing of it. So if it is destroyed when it is under his care, it is as if it was destroyed when under the care of its owner. This is like one who is given something for safekeeping, or the guardian of an orphan, and so on. It makes no difference whether he does that voluntarily or for payment; if he is negligent or transgresses, then he is liable. End quote.\nLeaving the excess baggage in the airport is regarded as negligence, and you should have contacted the owner of the items and worked out an arrangement to transfer those goods and pay excess baggage fees, or left them with someone honest, or told her to come and get them, and the like.\nBased on that, you are liable for these goods. If you can find a replacement for them, you must replace them, otherwise you are liable for their value on the day on which they were lost.\nSecondly:\nIf there was no agreement between you regarding payment for transporting the luggage, this means that you were doing it voluntarily, and you have no right now to demand payment.\nAnyone who carries luggage for someone else, or does work for him without a prior agreement on payment is doing it voluntarily, so he has no right to demand payment, unless that is his work which he does for a living, such as porters in the airport and the like. They are to be paid, even if there was no prior agreement.\nIt says in Kashshaf al-Qina‘ (4/206):\nWhoever does work for someone else without prior agreement on fees is not entitled to anything. That is because he offered his help without stipulating anything, so he is not entitled to any payment. That is so that no one will be obliged to pay anything that he did not commit to pay. This applies if the one who offered his help was not offering to do something that he does for a living. If he does do that for a living – such as sailors, porters, cuppers, fullers, tailors, real estate agents and so on, and such as those who measure and weigh things, and the like, who earn their living by doing these things – and the owner gives him permission to do that work, then he is entitled to the same wage as his peers, because that is what is customary.\nEnd quote.\nBased on that, you are not entitled to payment, because there was no prior agreement to that effect.\nYou should seek reward with Allah for what happened to you, for the reward with Allah for righteous deeds will not be lost.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/467899/is-the-person-who-was-entrusted-with-something-liable-if-he-leaves-it-in-the-airport-because-of-excess-weight
130499,"There was a discussion about the issue of putting one’s trust in Allah (tawakkul) and taking measures; the trust of some of the righteous is like that of Maryam, to whom summer fruits used to come in the winter and vice versa without her taking any measures; rather she focused completely on worship. Please advise us about that, may Allah bless you.","['Praise be to Allah.Shaykh `Abd Al-Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\nWhat is Tawakkul?\n“Putting one’s trust (Tawakkul) in Allah involves two things:\xa0\n\nDepending on Allah and believing that He is the One Who causes measures to be effective; His decree comes to pass; He has decreed all things, counted them out and ordained them, may He be glorified and exalted.\nTaking appropriate measures ; putting one’s trust in Allah does not mean refraining from taking measures ; rather part of putting one’s trust in Allah is taking appropriate measures and striving to do so. The one who refrains from doing so has gone against the laws and decree of Allah. Allah has commanded us to take appropriate measures and He encourages us to do so; He commanded His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to do that.\n\nIs it permissible to refrain from taking appropriate measures in Islam?\nSo it is not permissible for the believer to refrain from taking appropriate measures; in fact he is not truly putting his trust in Allah unless he takes appropriate measures. Hence it is prescribed to get married in order to have a child, and it is enjoined to have intercourse.\xa0\nIf someone were to say: I shall not get married and I shall wait to have a child without getting married, he would be regarded as insane; this is not the way of those who are wise and rational.\xa0\nSimilarly, he should not sit in his house or in the mosque seeking charity and waiting for provision to come to him; rather he should strive hard and work to seek to earn lawful provision.\xa0\nWhy did Allah tell Mary to shake a palm tree?\nMaryam (may Allah have mercy on her) did not forgo taking measures. Allah said to her (interpretation of the meaning): “And shake the trunk of the date-palm towards you, it will let fall fresh ripe-dates upon you.” [Maryam 19:25]\xa0\nSo she shook the palm tree and took appropriate measures until the dates fell. Her action is not contrary to taking measures and the fact that she found provision with her and that Allah honoured her and gave her some provision does not indicate that she refrained from taking appropriate measures; rather she devoted herself to worship and also took appropriate measures.\xa0\nIf Allah bestows upon some of His close friends some miracles (karamat), this is by His grace and bounty, but that does not indicate that we should forgo taking appropriate measures . It is proven that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Strive to do that which will benefit you and seek the help of Allah, and do not feel helpless.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2664)\nAnd Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help (for each and every thing).” [Al-Fatihah 1:5]\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/130499/what-is-tawakkul
184901,"I would like to ask about this man who leads the Naqshabandi Sufi tariqah, Nazim al-Haqqani. What advice can you give us on interacting with him and others like him?","['Praise be to Allah.This man, who is called Muhammad Nazim al-Haqqani an-Naqshabandi is one of the leading figures of the Naqshabandi Sufis. He used to live in Cyprus, and he had followers in Europe, America, East Asia and elsewhere. He died in 1435 AH.\nHe wrote a number of books about the Naqshabandi tariqah.\nBy researching his case, we find that he fell into many problematic matters, including the following:\nHis promotion of blatant shirk. In one of his lessons, he said: “We should not address the Lord of Glory directly, but we can address the qutub (a high-ranking wali or ‘saint’) who is in control.” Then he said: “The aqtab (plural of qutub) are men of Allah; they look at al-Lawh al-Mahfuz and control the affairs of the world, especially our master the qutub who is in control.”\nSee this at 5.00 in the video via the following link.\nThis is associating others with Allah in His Lordship (shirk ar-rububiyyah) and associating others with Him in worship. Believing that there is someone in control alongside Allah, may He be exalted, is associating someone else with Him in His Lordship, and believing that it is not permissible to call upon Allah, may He be exalted, directly, and that one must call upon Him through the aqtab is associating others with Allah in His divinity (shirk al-uluhiyyah).\nThis type of shirk is widespread among the Sufis.\nMuhammad az-Zamzami al-Maghrebi (may Allah have mercy on him) – who was a Sufi, then Allah guided him to Tawheed and the Sunnah – said, speaking of the innovations of the Sufis: One of them is their claim that the awliya’ (“saints”) are in control of running the affairs of the universe, so they give to some and withhold from others, they honour some and humiliate others, and they appoint people to positions of authority and dismiss others therefrom. Because of this corrupted belief, the Sufis turn to those who they believe are awliya’ and ask them to meet their needs, and they say: These are our intercessors with Allah; we ask of them and they intercede for us with Allah! And when they visit their graves, they recite a line of verse:\n“You are the door and Allah is most generous; whoever comes to you, his wishes will be met and he will be given generously.”\nThis belief is the same as the polytheists’ belief regarding their idols which they worshipped. They said: We only worship them so that they will intercede for us with Allah to meet our needs. Allah tells us about them in the Holy Quran (interpretation of the meaning):\n{ And they worship other than Allah that which neither harms them nor benefits them, and they say, ""These are our intercessors with Allah "" Say, ""Do you inform Allah of something He does not know in the heavens or on the earth?"" Exalted is He and high above what they associate with Him}\xa0[Yoonus 10:18].\nAllah states here that they are lying when they say that. Because of this innovation, the graves of the dead have become places of visitation to which ignorant people go when calamity strikes, and they go to some of them to ask for children, or to seek healing from sickness. Thus the graves have become like idols which are worshipped besides Allah.\nEnd quote from az-Zawiyah wa ma fiha min al-A‘mal wa’l-Bida‘ al-Munkarah (p.50).\nOne of this man’s actions that are contrary to Islam is that – in addition to saying that Allah cannot be asked directly, rather He must be asked through the aqtab – in a recorded meeting with the Pope of the Catholic Church, Benedict XVI, Nazim al-Haqqani asked the pope to pray for him! This is indicative of how far these misguided people have drifted away from the religion of Islam and sound human nature. For he forbids addressing Allah directly, then he asks the leader of the misguided Christians to pray for him!\nSee the meeting via the following link:\nThis also indicates that he is very ignorant of the belief in loyalty to the believers and disavowal of the disbelievers (al-wala’ wa’l-bara’), as he is very gentle with the Christian pope and one of his students kisses the pope’s hand in front of him, but he is stern with those whom he calls Wahhabis and Salafis, whom he reviles in crude terms. This confirms what some researchers have stated, that Sufism, by lending support to the disbelieving tyrants, was one of the causes of the Muslim ummah’s decline.\nYou can see him reviling the Wahhabis via this link.\nAnother of his misguided notions that is that he says that he is one of those whom the Most Gracious has ransomed from the Fire of Hell, and that the angel who is on his right records his good deeds, whereas the angel who is on his left does not record anything!\nAnother example of his misguidance is what happens in his gatherings of dancing. May Allah have mercy on Imam Ibn al-Qayyim, who said in verse:\n“When the Quran is recited, they sit still, not out of fear of Allah but like one whose mind is wandering.\nWhen the singing starts, they are like donkeys braying; by Allah, their dancing is not for the sake of Allah.\nDrum and flute and the melodious voice of a singer; when have you ever seen any kind of worship with music and entertainment?”\nSimilar to that is what happens in his gatherings of mixing between men and women, and the attendance of women who are uncovered and wearing make-up, and they kiss his hand. There are video clips which confirm that, but we do not want to share links here.\nThis is with regard to the man himself.\nAs for the ruling concerning him:\nIt may be said that he has undoubtedly fallen into some serious and grievous innovations, some of which could lead to him being deemed a disbeliever, and others of which are less serious than that. He and his group are among the most misguided of people, and you must warn people against him and against his group, pointing out their misguidance with wisdom. This is part of being sincere towards Allah and His Messenger. Otherwise, ruling that he himself is to be deemed a disbeliever depends on whether the conditions of doing that are met and the impediments to doing so are absent, as is the principle set out by Ahl as-Sunnah wa’l- Jama‘ah with regard to deeming someone to be a disbeliever. For more details regarding that, please see the answer to question no. 85102 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/184901/ruling-on-the-beliefs-and-actions-of-the-sufi-nazim-al-haqqani-shaykh-nazim
216483,"Is love for the sake of Allah and doing what is dictated thereby an act of worship that will bring one closer to Allah, may He be exalted? Is it equivalent to nafl (supererogatory) acts of worship or Hajj, as al-Hasan al-Basri said to someone: “O A’mash, do you not know that going and putting effort into helping your brother is like performing Hajj after Hajj?” Did he say that to him by way of simply motivating him, or is the reward for it actually as he said? How can a person reach such a level with the one whom he loves for the sake of Allah that he will stand in the shade of the Most Gracious and reach a point where Allah’s love becomes due to both of them?","[""Praise be to Allah.Importance of love for the sake of Allah\nLove for the sake of Allah is one of the strongest bonds of faith, and is one of the most important foundations on which Muslim society is based. It is the basis by means of which ties of friendship and harmony among people are attained, so that they love one another, visit one another, are sincere towards one another, intermarry, enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong, thus attaining true Islamic brotherhood. Through it people find the sweetness of faith in their interactions, companionship and friendship.\nAhmad (18524) narrated from al-Bara’ ibn `Aazib, that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Indeed the strongest bond of faith is to love for the sake of Allah and hate for the sake of Allah.” (Classed as hasan by the commentators on Al-Musnad; also classed as hasan by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Targhib (3030).\nLove for the sake of Allah is one of the greatest acts of worship and one of the best of righteous deeds.\nAl-Bukhari (13), Muslim (45), and An-Nasa’i (5017) narrated from Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “By the One in Whose Hand is the soul of Muhammad, no one of you truly believes until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself of good.”\nAl-Hafiz ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Al-Kirmani said: It is also part of faith to hate for his brother what he hates for himself of evil.” (Fath Al-Bari (1/58)\nIf faith, which is obligatory, is not complete unless one loves good for one’s fellow Muslim and hates evil for him, then loving the Muslim himself and being allied with him is more important and is of a higher level.\nAuthenticity of the Hadith “Do you not know that your going and striving to help your brother is better for you than performing Hajj after Hajj?”\nIbn Abi Dunya narrated in Qada’ Al-Hawa’ij (103) and in Istina’ Al-Ma`ruf (163) via Al-Hakam ibn Sinan: Malik ibn Dinar told us: Al-Hasan sent Muhammad ibn Nuh and Humayd At-Tawil on an errand for his brother, and said: Tell Thabit Al-Bunani to come to me with you. Thabit said to them: I am in seclusion worshipping my Lord (i'tikaf). Humayd went back to Al-Hasan and told him what Thabit had said, and he (Al-Hasan) said to him: Tell him: Do you not know that your going and striving to help your brother is better for you than performing Hajj after Hajj?\nThis is a weak isnad. Al-Hakam ibn Sinan is weak in hadith; he was classed as weak by Ibn Ma`in, An-Nasa’i, Ibn Sa`d, Abu Dawud and others. Ibn Hibban said: He is one of those who were sole narrators of fabricated hadiths from trustworthy narrators, so no attention should be paid to him.” ((Tahdhib At-Tahdhib (2/367)\nEven if we assume that it is sound, it may be understood as being by way of emphasizing and encouraging people to go about helping Muslims with what they need.\nMore sound than that is the hadith of Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “To go about with a brother of mine, trying to help him, is dearer to me than spending a month in seclusion (i’tikaf) in this mosque of mine. The one who goes about with his Muslim brother, trying to help him, until he meets his needs, Allah will make his feet steadfast on the Day when feet will slip.” (Narrated by At-Tabarani (13646), Ibn Bashran in Al-Amali, and others, classed as hasan by Al-Albani in As-Sahihah (906)\nIn Az-Zuhd (746), Ibn Al-Mubarak narrated that Abu Ja`far said:\n“A man came to Husayn ibn `Ali to seek his help, and he found him in seclusion for worship. He said: Were it not for being in seclusion, I would have gone out with you and helped you with what you need. Then the man left and went to Al-Hasan ibn `Ali, and told him what he needed, and he went out with him and helped him. The man said: I did not like to bother you and ask for your help, but I started with Husayn and he said, Were it not for being in seclusion, I would have gone out with you. Al-Hasan said: To help a brother in faith of mine is dearer to me than secluding myself in worship for a month.\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Helping Muslims with what they need is more important than secluding oneself for worship, because helping them benefits others and yourself, and doing something that benefits others and yourself is better than doing something that benefits only yourself, except when the deed that only benefits oneself is one of the obligatory and essential duties of Islam.” (Majmu` Fatawa wa Rasa’il Al-`Uthaymin (20/180)\nReward for love for the Sake of Allah\nAmong the seven whom Allah will shade with His shade on the Day when there will be no shade but His are “two men (people) who love one another for the sake of Allah, meeting and parting on that basis”, as it says in the sahih hadith on which the scholars are agreed.\nAhmad (22002) narrated from `Ubadah ibn As-Samit that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “[Allah says:] `My love is due for those who love one another for My sake; My love is due for those who visit one another for My sake; My love is due for those who help one another for My sake; My love is due for those whose hearts are free of grudges and who uphold ties with one another for My sake.’” (Classed as sahih by Al-Albani in Sahih Al-Jami` (4321)\nIt is possible to attain these high levels by means of sincere love for one’s brother, intending it solely for the sake of Allah, cooperating in righteousness and piety on a basis of love, sincerely advising one another to do good, getting together to do acts of worship, and casting away evil and inappropriate words and deeds; and by loving for your brother what you love for yourself, hating for him what you hate for yourself, sharing his joys and sorrows, helping him to obey Allah, helping him in matters of concern to him having to do with this world or the Hereafter, defending him in his absence, not hesitating to help him or any of his family members, speaking well of him, concealing his faults, not backbiting about him, and not telling lies about him; and by treating him as well as you would treat your own brother, if not better than that.\nTo sum up, you should treat him in all good ways that you would like to be treated yourself, in word and in deed, in his absence and in his presence.\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/216483/does-love-for-the-sake-of-allah-bring-you-closer-to-allah
