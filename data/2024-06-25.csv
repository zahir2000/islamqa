354831,"My question is about conditions in a transaction which were stipulated by the seller regarding the purchase of land by instalments. 1. If the purchaser fails to pay two consecutive instalments according to the payment plan, he is regarded as having defaulted, therefore there is no need for any warning or notification. In such a case, the seller has the right to terminate the agreement unilaterally and notify the purchaser in writing that it has ended. 2. If the purchaser ends the contract for any reason, the seller will allocate 30% of the purchase price as a stipulated penalty. After settling the penalty clause, the seller will return to the purchaser what remains of the instalments that had been made, in two equal payments, starting one month from the day when the contract was terminated, and the purchaser agrees not to demand any interest or compensation for the delay in repayment… etc. If this condition is not valid, what are the rights of the seller according to Islamic teachings, if the purchaser is unable to pay his debt, or he wants to get out of the contract? What are the valid conditions that the seller may stipulate in order to reduce the harm that would result from the purchaser getting out of the contract?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThere is nothing wrong with stipulating that the deal be cancelled if the purchaser defaults on two consecutive instalments, whether the purchaser is in financial difficulty or is well off but is taking too long to pay.\nIt says in Kashshaf al-Qina‘ (3/240): … or [if] the purchaser is in financial difficulty, even with regard to paying some of the price, then the seller has the right to cancel the deal immediately, because the delay is detrimental to his interests. End quote.\nIt says in al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (32/136): Ibn Taymiyah said that if the purchaser is in financial difficulty or is taking too long to pay, the seller may cancel the deal so as to ward off the harm to which dispute may lead. He said in al-Insaf: This is the correct view. End quote.\nSecondly:\nThere is nothing wrong with the seller stipulating that if the purchaser cancels the deal – with no valid reason according to Islamic teachings that allows him to do that – he must pay 30% of the price, because the basic principle is that conditions are valid.\nThe seller may refuse to cancel the deal, because a sale is a binding contract, but he may agree to cancel it in return for this amount of money, and it is permissible to stipulate that in the contract.\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The Muslims are bound by their conditions.” Narrated by Abu Dawud (3594); classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud.\nAl-Bukhari said in his Sahih: Ibn ‘Awn said, narrating from Ibn Sirin: A man said to the one from whom he wanted to lease a mount: Bring your mount, then if I do not set out with you on such and such a day, then you will have one hundred dirhams. Then he did not go out [on that day]. Shurayh said: Whoever stipulates a condition for himself willingly, without being forced, is bound by it.\nEnd quote from Sahih al-Bukhari: The Book of Conditions, Chapter on What Conditions are Permissible ... It says in a statement of the Islamic Fiqh Council concerning this issue: It is permissible to stipulate penalty clauses in all financial transactions, except in contracts in which there is a commitment to pay off a debt, because that is blatant riba (usury).\nSee the complete statement in the answer to question no. 112090 .\nThirdly:\nWhen cancelling a deal, the seller must return what the purchaser paid. If he stipulated that in the event of cancellation he will return the money in two equal payments, starting one month after cancellation of the deal, and the purchaser accepted that, there is nothing wrong with it, because of what was noted above about the basic principle being that conditions are valid.\nThus it becomes clear that it is permissible to stipulate these conditions in the contract.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/354831/ruling-on-the-seller-stipulating-a-penalty-clause-if-the-purchaser-cancels-the-transaction
270518,Please forgive me if my question sounds inappropriate. I need some guidance. I have been married for 15 yrs. Initially we exchanged French kisses but then hec started getting ill and hence for some reason or other would verbally abuse me. So I completely stopped kissing even though we would get intimate. Life has moved on but he has anger problems and this gets verbally abusive. He has requested many times for can French kiss and I just am trying my best but I feel how can I kiss a mouth that has said such and such words to me. My question is am I sinning? Should I forget and satisfy his desire?,"['Praise be to Allah.It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If a woman prays her five (daily prayers), fasts her month (Ramadan), guards her chastity and obeys her husband, she will enter whichever of the gates of paradise she wishes.” Narrated by Ibn Hibbaan (4163); classed as sahih by al-Albani.\nTherefore it is obligatory for the wife to obey her husband, so long as it does not involve disobedience towards Allah. This is one of the greatest of good deeds that may lead to paradise, after the woman fulfils her religious duties.\nWhilst we appreciate that you are suffering, we advise you to push yourself to respond to your husband’s request as much as you can, and we do not advise you to respond in the same way as he treats you, or to refuse intimacy with him because of his mistreatment, or to respond in kind, even though all of that is permissible for you and you cannot be blamed for it. Rather we advise you to try hard to treat him kindly as much as you can, and to make yourself respond to what he asks of you with regard to intimacy, or even to hasten to do what you know he likes before he asks you for it.\nWe advise all of the above for two reasons:\nFirstly, responding to his mistreatment in kind, even though it is legitimate justice between people, between spouses it only makes the problems worse and does not solve them. No relationship could continue between the spouses in that case; rather it is essential for them to interact with wisdom, forbearance, kindness and deliberation. Every time your husband shows harshness and strictness, wisdom dictates that you should respond in a soft manner; if he becomes stubborn regarding any issue, reason dictates that you should be easy-going regarding that matter, unless it involves sin or severing ties of kinship.\nSecondly, Allah, may He be exalted, has taught these good manners to His slaves and shown them the wisdom behind them and the great interest that may be served by adhering to them. He, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And not equal are the good deed and the bad. Repel [evil] by that [deed] which is better; and thereupon the one whom between you and him is enmity [will become] as though he was a devoted friend.\nBut none is granted it except those who are patient, and none is granted it except one having a great portion [of good]}\xa0[Fussilat 41:34-35].\nIf that etiquette is something that Allah has taught to all people when dealing with one another, then how about the interaction between spouses?\nWhatever you are unable to do or cannot bear it, so you do not do it because of what you feel of hurt sometimes, we hope that there will be no sin on you for that, and that you will be excused for it, on condition that this does not become your habit or the regular way in which you deal with your husband, and you do not use it as a means to solve problems between you. For that will only make matters more complicated and will not solve anything; rather it is like letting off steam most of the time or sometimes. The basic principle regarding your relationship with your husband is that you should obey him so long as it does not involve disobedience towards Allah, and you should give him his rights. If he disobeys Allah in the way he treats you, you should still obey Allah in the way you treat him, and try to make yourself do that as much as you can. Perhaps that may be a means of making him mend his ways and change his attitude, and come back to behaving in the way you like and treating you in an honourable manner.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/270518/ruling-on-the-wife-refusing-some-kinds-of-foreplay-because-she-is-subjected-to-verbal-abuse-by-her-husband
