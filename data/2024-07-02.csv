449362,"I was previously addicted to drugs, and I committed all kinds of sins, such as not praying, and so on. I am currently in the stage of recovery and repentance to Allah, may He be exalted, but it is difficult for me to do my religious duties and also focus on recovery from addiction at the same time. Please note that I take psychiatric medication, but I am trying hard to make myself pray, so long as I am not sleeping. But if I sleep and miss the prayer, I do not pray it, so that I do not burden myself with more than I can bear. But I am aware that this is a sin, but I am taking it step-by-step to do my religious obligations, so that I do not give up and drift away, and go back to my old ways. But – praise be to Allah – now, I pray so long as I hear the adhan, even though I do not always pray in the mosque. But I strive to make myself do the prayers, and at the same time I am aware of my shortcomings. The only reason I am striving to do that is because I tried to repent many times before, but I repent and do everything (of religious duties) once, then I find it difficult and I go back to my old ways. But this time, I started gradually, meaning that first of all I started to pray when I was not sleeping, and I am trying hard to do the prayers in the mosque. My intention is that if I do this action (prayer) perfectly and get used to it, then I will start to do the next action, and so on. My question is: is it permissible for me to take religious practice step-by-step, if it is difficult for me to do what Islam tells me to do all at once? Is it permissible to pray at home, noting that I am unwell, and I always pray Fajr in congregation, but it is difficult for me to pray Zuhr? Is it okay if I do not fast, because I have to take my medicine or it is too difficult for me to fast, and so on? What must I do as an addict during the recovery period, and as someone who used not to pray, then began taking it step-by-step to do religious duties, so that I do not burden myself with that which I cannot bear?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nWe praise Allah, may He be exalted, for guiding you and enabling you to repent, and we ask Him to help you and grant you a full recovery.\nSecondly:\nYou must do what you are able to of religious duties, and you will be excused – in sha Allah – with regard to what you are unable to do or what is definitely too difficult and is more than you can bear, according to your situation.\nYour praying in the mosque is something that is required according to Islamic teachings, and it is also part of your recovery, because mixing with people and good people will have a beneficial impact, in sha Allah.\nIf you sleep and miss Zuhr, or it is too difficult for you to go out to pray in the mosque, then you may pray at home or when you wake up, because of the report narrated by Muslim (684) from Anas ibn Maalik, who said: The Prophet of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever forgets a prayer or sleeps and misses it, his expiation is to offer that prayer when he remembers it.”\nThirdly:\nFasting is an important obligation which it is not permissible to omit except when one has an excuse. If you will be harmed by delaying taking your medicine until after iftar, this is an excuse which makes it permissible for you not to fast, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{O you who have believed, decreed upon you is fasting as it was decreed upon those before you that you may become righteous.\n\xa0[Fasting for] a limited number of days. So whoever among you is ill or on a journey [during them] - then an equal number of days [are to be made up]}\xa0[Al-Baqarah 2:183-184].\nIf you will not be harmed by delaying taking your medicine until after iftar, then you must fast.\nIf you will face hardship and find it too difficult to carry on fasting during the day, even though you are physically healthy – meaning that you are not feeling any symptoms of sickness, not even a headache, for example – then you must intend to fast from the night before, then if you start finding it too difficult to carry on and you become certain that it is beyond your capability to continue fasting, and you fear that you may be harmed by severe thirst, then you may drink, then you must refrain from eating and drinking for the rest of the day, and make up that day later on.\nIt says in Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah (10/233): It is not permissible for the accountable person not to fast during the day in Ramadan just because he is working.\nBut during the day, if he faces extreme hardship and realises that he has no choice but to break the fast during the day, he may do so by eating or drinking that which will ward off the hardship, then he should refrain from eating and drinking until sunset and break the fast with the people, and he must make up that day on which he broke the fast. End quote.\nBut if you are suffering from illness, such as a severe headache, this makes it permissible to not fast.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: There are several different scenarios with regard to the sick person and fasting.\n1.. He will not be affected by fasting, such as if he has a mild cold, a mild headache or a toothache and the like. In this case, it is not permissible for him not to fast, even though the scholars say that it is permissible for him not to fast because of the general meaning of the verse (interpretation of the meaning): {and whoever is ill} [al-Baqarah 2:185].\nBut we say: If this ruling is connected to a scenario in which breaking the fast will ease the hardship for him, then in that case we say that he may break the fast. But if the sick person will not be affected by fasting, then it is not permissible for him not to fast, and he is obliged to fast.\n2.. If it is difficult for him to fast (because of his sickness), but it will not harm him, then in this case it is disliked (makruh) for him to fast, and it is Sunnah for him to not fast.\n3.. If it is difficult for him to fast and it will harm him, such as a man who is suffering from kidney disease, diabetes or the like, then in that case fasting is prohibited for him.""(Ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘\xa0 6/341).\nWe advise you to offer a great deal of supplication and beseech Allah, may He be exalted, to accept your repentance and grant you good health. Strive to offer supplication at the times when a response is likely.\nWe ask Allah to comfort you, make things easy for you and accept your repentance.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/449362/he-is-being-treated-for-addiction-and-finds-it-difficult-to-do-the-prayers-and-fast
363652,"Her husband said to her that if she talks about her past, she is automatically divorced when she talks about it. He also said that whenever she would talk about her past, she is divorced one time, if she talks about it the second time, she would be the second divorced, and if she talks about it the third time, she is divorced the third time. They both didn't know about conditional divorce. She took permission from her husband and talk about her past many times with him. After she learned about conditional divorce, he asked her husband about that. Her husband said to her that he put the condition on specific past things, not all things. He told her that by saying "" you are divorced when you talk about your past"" he meant specific past things not all. Her husband said to her that she didn't break the condition because she didn't talk about what past things he meant. Can she trust her husband?. Did conditional divorce occurred?. ( note they didn't consummate the marriage). Plz, brother gives her a fatwa. ( her country's people follow the school of Hanafi). If it possible please brother give a reference so she would have no doubt","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIf the husband made the divorce dependent upon a condition and that condition was not met, then the divorce does not count as such.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf the husband connected the divorce to a particular time or to a specific condition, and made it dependent on that, it does not come into effect unless that condition is met or that time comes. This is the view of Ibn ‘Abbas, ‘Ata’, Jabir ibn Zayd, an-Nakha‘i, Abu Hashim (i.e., Yahya ibn Dinar), ath-Thawri, ash-Shafa‘i, Abu ‘Ubayd and ashab ar-ra’y.""(Al-Mughni\xa0 10/410).\nIf the divorcing husband uttered general words and said: I meant it to be specific, that is to be accepted from him, because general words may often be used to refer to specific meanings, and his intention makes specific what is general in wording and restricts that which is open-ended, as was stated by Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) and others.\nSee: at-Turuq al-Hukmiyyah fi’s-Siyasah ash-Shar ‘iyyah by Ibn al-Qayyim (2/803).\nAl-Bahuti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf in his heart he intended to exempt one of his wives from the general statements of divorce, such as if he said that his wives were divorced, but he intended to exclude So-and-so from that, then this exemption is valid and she is not divorced, because his saying “My wives are divorced” is a general statement, and it could be used to refer to some of what he mentioned, because using a general phrase to refer to something specific is something that is commonly accepted in ordinary speech.""(Ar-Rawd al-Murbi‘\xa0 6/531).\nHe also said (6/574, 575).\nIf someone says to his wife: “If I start talking to you, then you are divorced,” then she starts to speak, his oath becomes no longer applicable, because she spoke to him first and he did not speak to her first… unless what he meant was if he was the first to speak to her in some other situation. If that was what he meant, then it is to be understood according to what he meant and intended. End quote.\nBased on that, so long as the husband connected his words to specific things in the past, then he is to be believed with regard to what he said about his intention, and that is to be accepted from him. Thus the condition should be based on his intention, and you said that the wife did not speak about the things that the husband meant that she should not talk about, so no divorce takes place.\nThirdly:\nIf the man connected the divorce of his wife to a specific matter, as mentioned in the question and the like, then he has no right to retract the conditions he specified or to give her permission to do that thing. Rather if she does it, then he has broken his oath.\nAl-Bahuti (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The man who stipulated the condition for divorce of his wife has no right to cancel that condition, because cancelling it means that it is no longer applicable, but what happened cannot be deemed to no longer be applicable. So if the thing that was stipulated in order for divorce to occur happens, which is described as the condition, then she is divorced because that condition was met, and if it does not happen, then she is not divorced.""(Kashshaf al-Qina‘\xa0 12/297).\nSee also the answer to question no. 105438 .\nFourthly:\nIf it so happened that the wife spoke about what her husband meant with regard to her past, then most of the scholars say that the divorce counts as such, and the divorce is repeated every time she speaks of that, because the husband uttered the words “every time”, which is indicative of repetition.\nBut if that happened before the marriage was consummated, she is completely divorced by one talaq (divorce), and no other talaq counts after that.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah favoured the view that a conditional divorce counts as such if the husband intended that it should count, when that condition is met.\nBut if the husband’s intention was to prevent his wife from talking about a specific matter, then this comes under the ruling on oaths, and it does not count as a divorce, but the husband must offer expiation for breaking an oath (kaffarat yameen) if his wife goes against him.\nThis has been explained previously in the answer to question no. 229507 .\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about a woman who visits her family a great deal, and her husband said to her: “If you go to your family again, then you are divorced.” He said: She started to cry and urged me to change that, and I felt sorry for her, so I tried to find a way to re-interpret what I had said, and I told her: If you go to your family without my permission, then you are divorced, and now I give you permission to go.\nHe said: But I am not comfortable about that, because I did not ask any scholar about it; rather we carried on with our marital life as it had been.\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) replied:\nBefore answering this question, I would like to offer some advice. How often some Muslims do things which require us to give them some advice about those matters. I would like to say:\nAny action that a person does when he does not know the Islamic ruling concerning it, he is taking a risk by doing it. What the believer should do, when he wants to do some deed – whether it is an act of worship or some interaction with other people – is not to do anything until he finds out the Islamic rulings regarding it, so that he will be acting on the basis of knowledge, especially with regard to such serious matters as marriage and divorce.\nThe fact that a man does not realise what he has done until after he has been stricken with something which he may think is because of his infraction means that it is not appropriate for a believer or one who is prudent to do that thing. When that happened, this brother should have asked us, before trying to interpret things for himself on the basis of ignorance. I ask Allah to turn in mercy to us and to him.\nWith regard to the answer to his specific question, I say:\nIf, when this man said to his wife, “If you go to your family, then you are divorced,” he intended to threaten her and prevent her from going to her family, then this is regarded as coming under the ruling on oaths, and he may change his mind and offer expiation for breaking an oath (kaffarat yamin), which is freeing a slave, or feeding or clothing ten poor persons. If he cannot afford that, then he must fast for three days.\nBut if what he meant by saying “If you go to your family, then you are divorced” was divorce, and the idea that he had in mind was that she would be divorced if she disobeyed him and went against his wishes, and he does not want her to remain his wife, then in that case the divorce counts as such if she went to her family.\nHe cannot change this condition, meaning that he cannot add another condition to it or cancel it completely. So he cannot say the last thing he said: which was “If you go to your family without my permission, then you are divorced.” This does not count for anything, because by stipulating a condition the first time, the ruling became binding, which is that the divorce that was dependent upon this action of the wife would come into effect if she did that action. So he cannot add anything to it or subtract anything from it, or cancel it altogether.\nBased on that, if she went to her family, then she is divorced as a result of going to her family. If the divorce was revocable (first or second talaq), then he can take her back so long as her ‘iddah has not yet ended.\nYes, if he intended from the outset, that “if you go to your family, then you are divorced,” and he meant “without permission from me,” this intention makes the general statement specific, so if she went out with his permission, there is no blame on either of them.""(Fatawa Nur ‘ala ad-Darb\xa021/2).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/363652/is-it-valid-for-the-husband-to-retract-a-conditional-divorce-or-limit-it-after-uttering-it-by-stating-his-intention
