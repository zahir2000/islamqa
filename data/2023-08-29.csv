290668,What is the remedy for major hypocrisy? How can a person rid himself of major hypocrisy?,"['Praise be to Allah.Major hypocrisy is when a person inwardly disbelieves but outwardly shows himself as a Muslim.\nAl-Jurjani (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe hypocrite is the one who conceals kufr (disbelief) in his heart and inwardly adheres to it, but outwardly tells people that he is a believer.""(At-Ta‘rifat, p. 298).\nAs for minor hypocrisy – which is also known as hypocrisy in actions – it means making an outward display of doing righteous deeds, whilst concealing something else in one’s heart, or harbouring in one’s heart something other than what one shows outwardly, but that has nothing to do with the fundamentals of faith.\nThat includes having the characteristics of the hypocrites, namely lying, treachery and breaking promises.\nSee the answer to question no. 153691 .\nIf a person makes a show of believing in Allah, His angels, His Books, His Messengers and the Last Day, and conceals in his heart something that is contrary to that or contradicts some of it, then he is a hypocrite in the sense of major hypocrisy.\nThese are the ones to whom Allah, may He be exalted, refers in the verse (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Indeed, the hypocrites will be in the lowest depths of the Fire}\xa0[An-Nisa’ 4:145].\nThis is like the hypocrisy of Ibn Salul and the other hypocrites of whom Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And of the people are some who say, “We believe in Allah and the Last Day,” but they are not believers.\nThey [think to] deceive Allah and those who believe, but they deceive not except themselves and perceive [it] not.\nIn their hearts is disease, so Allah has increased their disease; and for them is a painful punishment because they [habitually] used to lie.\nAnd when it is said to them, “Do not cause corruption on the earth,” they say, ""We are but reformers.""\nUnquestionably, it is they who are the corrupters, but they perceive [it] not.\nAnd when it is said to them, “Believe as the people have believed,” they say, “Should we believe as the foolish have believed?” Unquestionably, it is they who are the foolish, but they know [it] not.\nAnd when they meet those who believe, they say, “We believe”; but when they are alone with their evil ones, they say, “Indeed, we are with you; we were only mockers.”\n[But] Allah mocks them and prolongs them in their transgression [while] they wander blindly.\nThose are the ones who have purchased error [in exchange] for guidance, so their transaction has brought no profit, nor were they guided.\nTheir example is that of one who kindled a fire, but when it illuminated what was around him, Allah took away their light and left them in darkness [so] they could not see.\nDeaf, dumb and blind - so they will not return [to the right path].\nOr [it is] like a rainstorm from the sky within which is darkness, thunder and lightning. They put their fingers in their ears against the thunderclaps in dread of death. But Allah is encompassing of the disbelievers.\nThe lightning almost snatches away their sight. Every time it lights [the way] for them, they walk therein; but when darkness comes over them, they stand [still]. And if Allah had willed, He could have taken away their hearing and their sight. Indeed, Allah is over all things competent}\xa0[Al-Baqarah 2:8-20].\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nSome hypocrisy is major, and the one whose hypocrisy is of this type will be in the lowest level of Hell. This is like the hypocrisy of ‘Abdullah ibn Ubayy and others of his ilk, who openly disbelieve in the Messenger, or reject some of what he brought, or hate him, or do not believe that they have to follow him, or feel happy when his religion suffers a setback, or feel upset if his religion prevails, and so on. Such a person cannot be anything but an enemy to Allah and His Messenger.\nThis type of hypocrisy existed at the time of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and continued after that. In fact, after he passed away it became greater than it had been during his time, because the reasons to have strong faith were greater at his time; even though those reasons for having strong faith were greater, hypocrisy still existed at his time, so it is more likely that it would exist at other times when those reasons were not as great as they had been.""(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa\xa0 28/434).\nThe way to rid yourself of major hypocrisy is by entering into the religion of Islam sincerely, affirming and believing wholeheartedly in Allah, His angels, His Books, His Messengers, the Last Day, and the divine decree, both good and bad.\nAnd you should testify that there is no god worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah with certainty in your heart, out of love for Allah and His Messenger.\nAny hypocrite who repents, cleanses his heart, and shows sincere devotion to Allah is one of the believers.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Indeed, the hypocrites will be in the lowest depths of the Fire - and never will you find for them a helper\nExcept for those who repent, correct themselves, hold fast to Allah, and are sincere in their religion for Allah , for those will be with the believers. And Allah is going to give the believers a great reward}\xa0[An-Nisa’ 4:145-146].\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/290668/how-to-rid-oneself-of-major-hypocrisy
394812,"One of my classmates in college said, a few months ago, “He is going to cause us to become disbelievers,” meaning that the professor is so harsh that he will make us lose our faith and become disbelievers [this is a colloquial Arabic expression]. Has he become a disbeliever because of saying that?","['Praise be to Allah.If a person says “So and so is going to cause us to become disbelievers”, what he means is that that person will push us to do that because of his bad attitude or raising doubts and the like.\nThat person does not become a disbeliever because of saying that, because he is speaking about something in the future that has not happened.\nBut saying such a thing is abhorrent in all circumstances, because disbelief (kufr) is not a matter to be taken so lightly that a person could fall into it because of some annoyance he is faced with. Using this phrase is indicative of a lack of religious commitment, and demonstrates that the issue of falling into disbelief is something that the speaker takes lightly.\nWhat we must do is be wary of slips of the titonguee. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Man does not utter any word except that with him is an observer prepared [to record]}\xa0[Qaf 50:18].\nAnd the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “A person may say a word which displeases Allah, thinking little of it, for which he will be thrown down into Hell.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (6478) and Muslim (2988).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/394812/ruling-on-saying-so-and-so-is-going-to-cause-us-to-become-disbelievers
