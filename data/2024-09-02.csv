127933,"In the hadith “No one of you believes until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself,” is what is meant that the person is a disbeliever – even if he believes in the Qur’an and Sunnah – until he loves his brothers? Or is what is meant that his faith is not complete? I hope you can explain.","['Praise be to Allah.With regard to the negation of faith in Quranic verses and Hadiths, sometimes what is meant is that the person is not a believer at all, so the person is a disbeliever, and sometimes what is meant is that the person does not have complete faith; thus he is basically a believer, so he is not a disbeliever, but he is lacking in faith.\nThe Hadith asked about is of the second type.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhat it means is that his faith is not complete, otherwise one who has not attained this characteristic is still basically a believer. (End quote from Sharh Muslim, 2/16)\nAl-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhat is meant is that his faith has not reached the perfect level until, in addition to his being a Muslim, people are safe from his harm, he wants good for them and he is sincere towards all of them in his dealings with them. (End quote from Al-Mufhim lima Ashkala min Talkhis Sahih Muslim, 1/224).\nHe also said:\nThat is: his faith is not complete, because the one who deceives a Muslim and is not sincere towards him is committing a major sin, but he does not become a disbeliever as a result, as we have explained more than once.\nBased on that, what the Hadith means is that the one who is described as having perfect faith is the one who is sincere in his dealings with people, so he wants for them what he wants for himself and dislikes for them what he dislikes for himself. (End quote from Al-Mufhim, 1/227).\nWhat indicates that what is meant by the negation of faith in this Hadith is negation of complete faith is the fact that the version of this Hadith narrated by Ibn Hibban says: “No one can attain true faith until he loves for people what he loves for himself of good.” (Al-Albani classed it as authentic in Sahih At-Targhib, 1780).\nAl-Hafidh Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhat is meant by the negation of faith is that the person has not attained complete faith…\nIbn Hibban stated – based on a report of Ibn Abu `Adiy from Husayn Al-Mu`allim – that in the Hadith “No one can attain true faith,” what is meant by “true faith” is complete faith, which means that the one who does not attain this characteristic does not become a disbeliever. (End quote from Fat-h Al-Bari, 1/57).\nIbn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“No one can attain true faith until he loves for people what he loves for himself of good” – this version explains the meaning of the version that is narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim, and demonstrates that what is meant by the negation of faith is that the individual has not attained true or ultimate faith. Faith is often negated because it is lacking some of its essential or obligatory parts, as when the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “No adulterer is a believer at the time when he is committing adultery; no thief is a believer at the time when he is stealing; no drinker of wine is a believer at the time when he is drinking it” and “He does not believe, whose neighbour is not safe from his evil conduct.” (End quote from Jami` Al-`Ulum wal-Hikam, 120)\nWhat is meant by the negation of faith here is the lack of complete faith that is obligatory. So the one who does not love for his brother what he loves for himself is falling short in the faith that is required of him and is committing something that is prohibited, for which he deserves punishment.\nAl-Hafidh Ibn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhen the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said that the one who does not love for his brother what he loves for himself does not truly believe, this indicates that this is one of the characteristics of faith and, in fact, is one of the obligations thereof, for faith cannot be negated unless one of its obligations is not being met, as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said elsewhere: “No adulterer is a believer at the time when he is committing adultery…” Rather a man can only love for his brother what he loves for himself when he is free of envy, rancour, deceit and resentment, and that is something that is obligatory.

469532,"If the father is well off and provides his family with all basic needs that are required according to Islamic teachings, and he has a lot of money left over, but he uses the excuse that he has done what is required according to Islam, so he will not buy non-essential luxuries that he can easily afford for the children, how can we respond to such a father? Especially when it hurts the children’s feelings to see him refusing to buy a simple cake to celebrate the achievement of one of his children, on the grounds that it is non-essential and he is not obliged to provide it?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt is indisputably obligatory for the father to spend on his children. Ibn al-Mundhir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The scholars are agreed that a man must spend on his young children who have no wealth, and they are agreed that if the father dies and leaves behind wealth, the costs of maintenance for the child and the fee for breastfeeding him are to be taken from that wealth. End quote from al-Ijma‘ (98).\nIbn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: All the scholars from whom we acquired knowledge were agreed that the man is obliged to spend on his young children who have no wealth, because a man’s child is part of him, and he is part of his father. Just as he is obliged to spend on himself and his wife, he is also obliged to spend on his children and parents. End quote from al-Mughni (8/212).\nAl-Kasani gave the reason for that, as he said: And because spending when there is a need comes under the heading of maintaining the life of the one on whom that money is spent. The child is part of the father, and it is obligatory for him to maintain his own life and the life of the child who is part of him. Based on what we have mentioned above, each of them is obliged to spend on the other.\nBecause ties of kinship of this kind must be upheld and it is prohibited to sever those ties according to scholarly consensus, and spending on maintenance comes under the heading of upholding these ties, it is obligatory. Not doing that when one is able to do it, and when the one on whom he is obliged to spend is in need, leads to severing those ties of kinship, so it is prohibited.""(Bada’i‘ as-Sana’i‘\xa0 5/2230).\nSecondly:\nThe religious texts did not specify a specific amount for maintenance, because that is something that varies according to people’s circumstances and what they can afford, and according to differences in customs and traditions. Islam refers such matters to local custom (‘urf), so what is obligatory with regard to maintenance for children is what the people in that community regard as essential for the man to spend on the maintenance of his children. That includes fundamentals such as food, drink and clothing, and basic needs, such as transportation, basic education and marriage.\nThis is indicated by the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to Hind: “Take what is sufficient for you and your children on a reasonable basis.” Al-Bukhari (5364).\nThirdly:\nAnything more than the maintenance which is obligatory – when the man can afford it – comes under the heading of kind treatment which Allah, may He be exalted, has enjoined. He has enjoined kindness and generosity to relatives, and the closest of people to a man are his children. Being kind and generous is something additional to doing what is obligatory, which is being just and fair. Allah, may He be exalted, has enjoined justice, and kindness and generosity, and He singled out relatives for mention in the verse (interpretation of the meaning): {Verily, Allah enjoins justice, kindness and giving kinsfolk [their due]} [an-Nahl 16:90]. Justice in the case of maintenance means doing what is obligatory, and kindness means doing more than that, by being generous towards them as much as one can afford.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Kindness is something additional to fairness, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {Verily, Allah enjoins justice, kindness and giving kinsfolk [their due]} [an-Nahl 16:90]. Kindness sometimes means complying with what is required according to Islamic teachings – even if it is obligatory – and sometimes it means doing more than is obligatory.(Tafsir al-‘Uthaymin: al-Fatihah wa’l-Baqarah\xa01/169).\nIbn Sa‘di (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \xa0Allah singled out giving to relatives for mention – even though it is included in the general meaning – so as to emphasize their rights and the importance of upholding ties with them, showing kindness to them and striving in doing that. That includes all relatives, whether they are closely or distantly related, but the more closely they are related, the greater their right to kindness is.""(Tafsir as-Sa‘di\xa0\xa0p. 447).\nThe Quran also mentions them after the command to show kindness to parents, in the verse (interpretation of the meaning): {Be kind to parents [and] relatives} [an-Nisa’ 4:36].\nBased on that, being generous towards one’s children is something that Allah has enjoined, and He has made it a means of attaining His love, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): {for Allah loves those who do good} [Al ‘Imraan 3:134].\nThe religious texts also encourage showing generosity to one’s wife and children.\nAccording to the hadith, the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The best dinar that a man spends is a dinar that he spends on his dependents, and a dinar that a man spends on his mount (for jihad) for the sake of Allah, and a dinar that he spends on his companions (in jihad) for the sake of Allah.” Abu Qilabah said: He started with the dependents. And Abu Qilaabah said: What man is greater in reward than a man who spends on young dependents and protects them from resorting to asking of people – or Allah benefits them through him? Narrated by Muslim (994).\nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said in a marfu‘ report [that is, one that is attributed directly to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)]: “A dinar that you spend for the sake of Allah, a dinar that you spend to free a slave, a dinar that you give in charity to a needy person and a dinar that you spend on your family – the greatest of them in reward is the one that you spend on your family.” Narrated by Muslim (995).\nIt was narrated from ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: “If Allah is generous to you, then be generous.”\nUndoubtedly a father’s being generous to his children and not being stingy with them is one of the most effective ways of reaching their hearts and increasing love between them, because people naturally love the one who shows kindness to them.\nIn this situation, being generous is something to be emphasized when there is an occasion which calls for that, such as one of the children succeeding in exams, or completing the Quran or part of it, or reaching the age of accountability, and so on. These are occasions which require a display of happiness and celebration, and it is important to do that, because the effect on the child cannot be ignored. Hence it is prescribed to offer feasts on numerous occasions, including ‘aqiqah when a child is born, or offering a wedding feast. Some scholars say that it is recommended to celebrate the child’s completing the Quran and so on. This is a beneficial guideline for raising children.\nFourthly:\nThe things referred to in the question are non-essential items, so the father may decide not to provide them by way of raising the children with a simple life and not let them get used to having non-essential luxuries. He may be right or wrong in his decision, but he may be excused and be appreciated for his efforts and the hardship he goes through to provide obligatory maintenance. Thus we may regard his approach as something for which he is to be praised. Many fathers save what is surplus to necessity for the future interests of the children, not to enjoy it themselves. This is something that should be taken into consideration.\nRelationships between family members are not limited to essential and unavoidable rights and duties; rather there should be room for love, compassion, gentleness, kindness, upholding ties of kinship and being easy-going, especially with regard to one’s parents.\nIn most cases, the children will eventually realize that what their father is doing is in their best interests, because parents are usually keener to do that which will benefit their children than the children themselves are. Hence the family must appreciate that and not make it a reason to complain about the father. In the hadith that was narrated from Abu’d-Darda’, it is narrated that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The father is the middle gate of Paradise; if you wish, you may miss that gate or you may maintain it.” Narrated by at-Tirmidhi (1900); classed as sahih by al-Albani in as-Silsilah as-Sahihah (914).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/469532/is-it-obligatory-to-provide-non-essential-luxuries-for-children
34171,I would like to know if Allah will forgive somebody who has done shirk knowingly but wants to change his ways for good forever pls it is very important and another thing how can such a person be forgiven and know that he is forgiven and how can a person increase his iman and do the things that are halal and avoid haram plus be void of psychological problems because I have a lot of them and they bring a lot of confusion and anger and lead me astray thank u pls i am very desperate for guidance from Allah in the form of a person.,"['Praise be to Allah.Is Shirk forgivable?\nAllah has told us that he will forgive all sins for the one who repents to Him. He says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Say: ‘O My slaves! who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allah, verily, Allah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful’” [Az-Zumar 39:53]\nThis includes all sins, even Shirk . Whoever repents, Allah will accept his repentance .\xa0\nHow to repent from Shirk\nWith regard repentance from Shirk in particular and the acceptance thereof, Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And those who invoke not any other god along with Allah, nor kill such person as Allah has forbidden, except for just cause, nor commit illegal sexual intercourse and whoever does this shall receive the punishment. The torment will be doubled to him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein in disgrace; Except those who repent and believe (in Islamic Monotheism), and do righteous deeds; for those, Allah will change their sins into good deeds, and Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” [Al-Furqan 25:68-70]\xa0\nAllah mentions the disbelief and Shirk (associating others with Allah) of the Christians, then calls them to repent. He says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Surely, disbelievers are those who said: “Allah is the third of the three (in a Trinity).” But there is no god (none who has the right to be worshipped) but One God (Allah). And if they cease not from what they say, verily, a painful torment will befall on the disbelievers among them. Will they not turn with repentance to Allah and ask His forgiveness? For Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” [Al-Ma’idah 5:73-74]\xa0\nNo matter how great the sin, the forgiveness, generosity and kindness of Allah is greater.\xa0\nAll you have to do is to turn to Allah , regret what you did and resolve not to do it again. Then receive the glad tidings of the bounty and mercy of Allah, for Islam wipes out whatever sins came before it, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to `Amr ibn Al-`As (may Allah be pleased with him): “O `Amr, do you not know that Islam wipes out whatever came before it.” (Narrated by Muslim, 121 and Ahmad, 17861)\xa0\nAnd the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The one who repents from sin is like one who did not sin.”\xa0 (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, and classed as sound by Al-Albani) \xa0\nIf a person repents to Allah, Allah accepts his repentance and forgives him. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And He it is Who accepts repentance from His slaves, and forgives sins.” [Ash-Shura 42:25]\xa0\n“And verily, I am indeed forgiving to him who repents, believes (in My Oneness, and associates none in worship with Me) and does righteous good deeds, and then remains constant in doing them (till his death.)” [Ta-Ha 20:82]\xa0\nWe have to think well of our Lord and hope that He will accept our repentance, for Allah says, “I am as My slave thinks I am.” (A Qudsi Hadith narrated by Al-Bukhari, 7066 and Muslim, 2675) According to Ahmad with an authentic chain of narrators:\xa0 “I am as My slave thinks I am, so let him think whatever he wants.”\xa0\nHow to strengthen faith\nWith regard to strengthening your faith , this may be done in many ways, such as the following:\xa0\n\nRemembering Allah a great deal, reading His Book and sending a great deal of blessings upon His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).\xa0\nRegularly offering the obligatory prayers on time and offering a lot of optional prayers, so that one may attain the love and support of Allah as it says in the Hadith: “Whosoever shows enmity to someone devoted to Me, I shall be at war with him. My servant draws not near to Me with anything more loved by Me than the religious duties I have enjoined upon him, and My servant continues to draw near to Me with supererogatory works so that I shall love him. When I love him I am his hearing with which he hears, his seeing with which he sees, his hand with which he strikes and his foot with which he walks. Were he to ask [something] of Me, I would surely give it to him, and were he to ask Me for refuge, I would surely grant him it.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 6137)\xa0\nKeeping company with good people who will help you to worship and obey Allah and discourage you from disobeying Him. \xa0\nReading biographies of righteous people among the scholars, ascetics (Zahids), devoted worshippers and those who repented.\xa0\nKeeping away from everything that reminds you of sin and calls you to it.\xa0\n\nIn general, faith is increased by doing acts of worship and keeping away from prohibited things.\xa0\nWe ask Allah to help you and to accept your repentance, and to guide your heart.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34171/is-shirk-forgivable
249339,"You have a verdict stating that it is permissible to use vanilla which contains alcohol. This ruling has made people in Britain think that one can use food which contains alcohol or wine, on the basis that they evaporate after cooking the food, as stated in your verdict. We hope that you can discuss this verdict again, because it has led to confusion among many women here, and they have begun to buy all those types of foods – there is no power and no strength except with Allah. There are some who say that if it is permissible to buy such foods, then adding alcohol to food when cooking it is also permissible. By Allah, this is a serious problem, so – please – I urge you to discuss the issue again, because the sisters took the verdict from your website.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nAlcohol is an intoxicant and subject to the same rulings as wine, so it is not permissible to deliberately add it to food, medicine, or anything else.\nBut if it has already been added to something, then the sin is on the one who added it.\nThen we should try to find out about the amount of alcohol in the food or medicine. If the amount of alcohol in it is so small that it is absorbed into the food, so that no trace of it remains and the one who eats or drinks a lot of this food or medicine will not become intoxicated, then there is nothing wrong with consuming it.\nThis is contrary to the case where the traces of alcohol or wine remain discernible, such as some types of chocolate, for example, to which some alcohol has been added. In this case, it is not permissible to sell, buy or consume such foods.\nWhat we said about vanilla is not excluded from that. We did not say that it is permissible to use alcohol in it; rather we said that it is permissible to consume it if no trace of alcohol is discernible in it.\nIt says in Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah (22/123): The way in which vinegar is made in Egypt involves using nabeedh or beer, which are then put in sawdust and another substance is added to it until the nabeedh ferments and gives us Egyptian vinegar, as is explained in the science curriculum for students in the third year of preparatory school. What is the ruling on consuming this vinegar?\nAnswer: It is not permissible to add anything that could cause intoxication to something that is intended to be used as medicine, food or drink, or in anything that is intended to be used to make food, drink or condiments, whether that intoxicating substance is nabeedh, beer or anything else.\nA fatwa was issued by the Permanent Committee stating the ruling on mixing medicine with alcohol, and the ruling on consuming it. The fatwa stated: It is not permissible to mix medicines with alcohol that causes intoxication.\nBut if it is already mixed with alcohol, it is permissible to use it if the amount of alcohol is very small and no trace of it is discernible in the colour, taste or smell of the medicine, and drinking it does not cause intoxication. Otherwise, it is prohibited to use that with which alcohol has been mixed.\n‘Abdullah ibn Qa‘ud, ‘Abdullah ibn Ghadyan, ‘Abd ar-Razzaaq ‘Afifi, ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn ‘Abdillah ibn Baz. End quote.\nSo you should point out the difference between adding alcohol or wine to food or medicine, which is prohibited, because alcohol must be poured away and destroyed, and it is not permissible to use it, and using food or medicine which contains alcohol or has been treated with alcohol. The latter is subject to further discussion; if this mixture does not cause intoxication in larger amounts, and no trace remains in it of the alcohol, then it is not regarded as khamr (intoxicant) and it is permissible to consume it.\nFor more information, please see questions no. 59899 , 177030 , 201520 and 198536 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/249339/verdict-on-adding-a-small-amount-of-alcohol-or-wine-to-food-or-drink
39258,"Is it permissible for me to return the Salam of a woman who is a stranger to me, i.e., a non-Mahram?","['Praise be to Allah.The command to spread Salam\xa0\nAllah has commanded us to spread the greeting of Salam, and has enjoined us to return the greeting to all Muslims. He has made the greeting of Salam one of the things that spread love among the believers.\xa0\nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n""When you are greeted with a greeting, greet in return with what is better than it, or (at least) return it equally. Certainly, Allah is Ever a Careful Account Taker of all things."" [An-Nisa\' 4:86]\nAnd it was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""You will not enter Paradise until you (truly) believe, and you will not (truly) believe until you love one another. Shall I not tell you something which, if you do it, you will love one another? Spread the greeting of Salam amongst yourselves."" (Narrated by Muslim, 54)\xa0\nIn the answer to question no.\xa04596 , there is a lengthy discussion on the importance of greeting with Salam and returning the greeting.\xa0\nObligation for all Muslims to initiate and return the greeting of Salam\xa0\nThe command to spread the greeting of Salam is general and applies to all the believers. It includes men greeting men and women greeting women, and a man greeting his female Mahrams. All of them are enjoined to initiate the greeting of Salam, and the other is obliged to return the greeting .\xa0\nBut there is a special ruling that applies to a man greeting a non-Mahram woman, because of the Fitnah (temptation) that may result from that in some cases.\xa0\nCan we greet non-Mahrams with Salam?\nThere is nothing wrong with a man greeting a non-Mahram woman with Salam, without shaking her hands , if she is elderly , but he should not greet a young woman with Salam when there is no guarantee that there will be no Fitnah (temptation). This is what is indicated by the comments of the scholars, may Allah have mercy on them. \xa0\nImam Malik was asked: Can a woman be greeted with Salam? He said: With regard to the elderly woman, I do not regard that as disliked, but with regard to the young woman, I do not like that.\xa0\nAz-Zarqani explained the reason why Malik did not like that, in his commentary on Al-Muwatta\': Because of the fear of Fitnah when he hears her returning the greeting.\xa0\nIn Al-Adab Ash-Shar`iyyah (1/370) it says: Ibn Muflih mentioned that Ibn Mansur said to Imam Ahmad: (What about) greeting women with Salam? He said: If the woman is old there is nothing wrong with it.\xa0\nSalih (the son of Imam Ahmad) said: I asked my father about greeting women with Salam. He said: With regard to old women, there is nothing wrong with it, but with regard to young women, they should not be prompted to speak by being made to return the Salam.\xa0\nAn-Nawawi said in his book Al-Adhkar (p. 407):\xa0\n“Our companions said: Women greeting women is like men greeting men. But when it comes to women greeting men, if the woman is the man\'s wife, or his concubine, or one of his Mahrams, then it is like him speaking to another man ; it is recommended for either of them to initiate the greeting of Salam and the other is obliged to return the greeting. But if the woman is a stranger (non-Mahram), if she is beautiful and there is the fear that he may be tempted by her, then the man should not greet her with Salam, and if he does then it is not permissible for her to reply; she should not initiate the greeting of Salam either, and if she does, she does not deserve a response. If he responds then this is disliked.\xa0\nIf she is an old woman and he will not be tempted by her, then it is permissible for her to greet the man with Salam and for the man to return her Salam.\xa0\nIf there is a group of women then a man may greet them with Salam, or if there is a group of men, they may greet a woman with Salam, so long as there is no fear that any of the parties may be tempted.\xa0\nAbu Dawud (5204) narrated that Asma’, the daughter of Yazid said: ""The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) passed by us women and greeted us with Salam."" (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud).\xa0\nAnd Al-Bukhari (6248) narrated that Sahl ibn Sa`d said: ""There was an old woman of our acquaintance who would send someone to Buda`ah (a garden of date-palms in Madinah). She would take the roots of Silq (a kind of vegetable) and put them in a cooking pot with some powdered barley. After we had prayed Jumu`ah, we would go and greet her, then she would offer (that food) to us.""\xa0\nAl-Hafidh said in Al-Fath:\xa0\n“Concerning the permissibility of men greeting women with Salam and women greeting men: what is meant by its being permitted is when there is no fear of Fitnah .\xa0\nAl-Halimi was quoted as saying: Because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was infallible and protected from Fitnah. Whoever is confident that he will be safe from temptation may greet (women) with Salam, otherwise it is safer to keep silent.\xa0\nAnd Al-Muhallab is quoted as saying: It is permissible for men to greet women with Salam and for women to greet men, if there is no fear of Fitnah.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/39258/can-we-greet-non-mahrams-with-salam
