258651,"Will the Muslim be rewarded for reciting dhikr without focus of mind (reciting dhikr automatically)? Will he be rewarded for that, such as reciting tahlil (La ilaha illa Allah) or istighfar (Astaghfirullah), but without focus of mind? Will he receive the reward in full, as mentioned in the hadiths that speak of dhikr?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nWhat the Muslim should do is remember Allah, may He be exalted, properly, so that he will reap the benefits of dhikr and achieve its objectives, which cannot be achieved unless the verbal dhikr is accompanied by dhikr in the heart, for it is not sufficient for the person to simply move his lips and tongue in dhikr.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{The believers are only those who, when Allah is mentioned, their hearts become fearful, and when His verses are recited to them, it increases them in faith; and upon their Lord they rely}\xa0[al-Anfal 8:2].\nThe benefits of dhikr – namely fear of Allah and increased faith – cannot be attained except through reflection and contemplation.\nShaykh ‘Abd ar-Rahman as-Sa‘di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n{are only those who, when Allah is mentioned, their hearts become fearful} that is, they are filled with fear and awe, and that fear of Allah (st) dictates that they should refrain from that which is prohibited. Fear of Allah (st) is one of the greatest signs that restrain one from committing sin.\n{and when His verses are recited to them, it increases them in faith}, the reason being that they listen to them with presence of mind, contemplating the meaning, and as a result of that their faith increases, because contemplation is one of the actions of the heart, and it is inevitable that they will learn a meaning that they did not know, or they will be reminded of something that they had forgotten, or it will make their hearts inclined towards good and make them long for the reward of their Lord, or will make them fear His punishment, or they will be deterred from sin. All of these are things that increase one in faith.""(Tafsir as-Sa‘di, p. 315).\nBeing content merely to recite dhikr verbally, without reflection in the heart, will not lead to the hoped-for benefits of dhikr as it should be done, and it will be an action that falls short.\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nDhikr with focus and reflection will increase a person’s knowledge of Allah and love of Him; it will make him feel shy before Him and prompt fear of His punishment, and it will make him realise that Allah is constantly watching him, which will deter him from falling short in doing acts of worship or being careless in committing sins and doing bad deeds.\nDhikr that is only verbal will not lead to any of these benefits, and if it does lead to any of that, it will be lacking.""(Al-Wabil as-Sayyib ( p. 221).\nSecondly:\nIf the Muslim falls short and only recites dhikr verbally, will he be rewarded?\nIt was said that yes, he will be rewarded as befits his deed, for moving the tongue with words remembering Allah is a righteous deed with which the tongue is occupied, and it is a verbal act of worship. If he reflects in his heart on what his tongue is uttering, that is good, otherwise his reward will be commensurate with his action.\nHowever, there will inevitably be some sort of reflection in the heart on what he is saying, even if it is not perfect, and he will think of what he is saying to some extent. Hence he will choose a supplication (du‘a’), for example, in one situation, and he will choose istighfar or pure dhikr in other situations, and so on, and Allah has ordained reward for every action.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAl-Qadi ‘Iyad (may Allah have mercy on him) said: dhikr or remembrance of Allah, may He be exalted, is of two types: dhikr in the heart and dhikr on the tongue… As for dhikr on the tongue or purely verbal dhikr, it is the least type of dhikr, but it is still of great value, as mentioned in the hadiths.""(Sharh Sahih Muslim\xa0 17/15).\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf dhikr is recited verbally only, the one who utters it will be rewarded.\nIt is not stipulated that he should focus on the meaning, but it is stipulated that he should not intend its meaning in a wrong way.\nIf, in addition to uttering the words, he focuses on them in his heart, that is better.\nIf, in addition to that, he bears in mind the meaning of the words and what they contain of venerating Allah, may He be exalted, and denying that He has any shortcomings, that is even better.""(Fath al-Bari\xa0 11/209).\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWith regard to dhikr, people are at four levels:\n\nDhikr in the heart and on the tongue; this is what is enjoined.\nDhikr in the heart only. If the person is unable to speak, that is fine, but if he is able to speak, then he has failed to do what is better.\nDhikr on the tongue only. In this case the person is keeping his tongue moist with the remembrance of Allah, as is mentioned in the story of the person in whom the angels found nothing good to his credit except that he kept moving his tongue in remembrance of Allah. Allah, may He be exalted, says (in the hadith qudsi): “I am with My slave so long as he remembers Me and his lips move in remembrance of Me.”\nWhen there is neither kind of dhikr. This is the state of the losers.""(Majmu‘ Fatawa\xa010/566).\n\nFor more information, please see the answers to questions no. 72826 and 235993 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/258651/ruling-on-reciting-dhikr-without-focus-of-mind-and-reflection
140840,"I want to know how sound the hadith “Choose strangers for marriage” is, which is widely circulated among people. Is marrying relatives not encouraged in Islamic teachings?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIn some hadiths it is encouraged to seek strangers or non-relatives for marriage, but none of these hadiths have been proven to be soundly narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nAl-Hafiz Ibn al-Mulaqqan (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nI have not seen anything regarding this topic in any book of hadith that could be reliable.""(Al-Badr al-Munir\xa0 7/500).\nThere follow some of the hadiths that have been narrated concerning that:\n\n“Choose strangers for marriage”\n\nShaykh al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about that and he said: It is da‘if (weak).\nHe was asked: Have any sahih (sound) hadiths been narrated which encourage marrying non-relatives?\nThe shaykh replied, No. ""(Silsilat al-Huda wa’n-Nur (tape no. 594, 0.53).\n\n“Do not marry close relatives, for the child will be born unhealthy.”\n\nAl-Hafiz Abu ‘Amr Ibn as-Salaah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nI have not found any reliable source for it. End quote.\nIt was narrated by al-Haafiz Ibn al-Mulaqqan in al-Badr al-Munir (7/499).\nAs-Subki mentioned it in Tabaqat ash-Shafa‘iyyah (6/154) among the hadiths that were quoted by Abu Hamid al-Ghazali in Ihya’ ‘Ulum ad-Din for which he found no isnads.\nShaykh al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIt has no basis and cannot be attributed to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). It is well known nowadays among those who pretend to be knowledgeable, and some doctors, who do not fear Allah when teaching their students, so they teach them views and ideas that have no proof or evidence. There are some hadiths that do not have a leg to stand on, and have no basis in the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), such as this hadith. I have been asked about it many times by some of their students.""(As-Silsilah ad-Da‘ifah\xa0 5365).\nSome scholars stated that it is recommended to marry a woman who is not a relative.\nAl-Ghazali (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nShe should not be a close relative, because that reduces desire… End quote from Ihya’ ‘Ulum ad-Din (2/41).\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nYou should choose a woman who is not a relative, for her children will be more intelligent. Hence it was said: Marry non-relatives so that you will not have weak children. One of them said: The children of non-relatives are more intelligent, and the children of cousins are more resilient. Moreover, there is no guarantee that enmity will not develop in the marriage, which could end in divorce, and if the wife is a relative, that may lead to severing ties of kinship, which we are enjoined to uphold.""(Al-Mughni\xa0\xa07/83).\nBut this ruling is not agreed upon among the jurists. Some of them rejected this idea, quoting as evidence the fact that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) gave his daughter Fatimah in marriage to her paternal cousin ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib, and he gave his daughter Zaynab in marriage to her maternal cousin Abu’l-‘As ibn ar-Rabi‘, and so on.\nAs-Subki (may Allah have mercy on him) said, commenting on the view that it is recommended to marry non-relatives:\nThis ruling cannot be sound, because there is no evidence to support it. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) gave his daughter Fatimah in marriage to ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with them both), and she was his close relative.""(Quoted from Mughni al-Muhtaj by ash-Sharbini 4/206).\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\nI read something that said, “Marry non-relatives lest you have unhealthy children.” Is it a sahih hadith? Are there any other hadiths about this topic? We hope that you can explain what is the sound Sunnah with regard to the issue of choosing a wife.\nHe replied:\nThis has no basis; rather it is better to marry relatives, as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) gave his daughters in marriage to some of his relatives. As for the view of some jurists, there is no basis for it; rather it is optional. If a man wants to marry relatives such as his paternal cousin or maternal cousin, or if he wants to marry a non-relative, there is nothing wrong with that.\nAs for the view of those who say that marriage to a non-relative will produce more intelligent children and is better, there is no basis for that and no evidence to support it. If there is a relative who is good, it is more appropriate to marry her, and marriage to her may be regarded as upholding ties of kinship. But if there is a non-relative who is better-looking and better in character, then marrying a non-relative is better.\nThe point is that the man should seek a righteous wife, whether she is a relative or not, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Women may be married for four things: their wealth, their lineage, their beauty and their religious commitment. Choose the one who is religiously-committed, may your hands be rubbed with dust (i.e., may you prosper).” So the believer should seek a woman who is religiously committed and good, even if she is not one of his relatives; by the same token, women should seek a righteous husband and ask about him, even if he is not one of her relatives.""(Fatawa Nur ‘ala ad-Darb\xa0 tape no. 831).\nFor more information, please see the answer the question no. 72263 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/140840/marrying-relatives-and-the-hadith-choose-strangers-for-marriage
