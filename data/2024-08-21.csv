178188,What is the ruling if a man shuns his wife for five consecutive months?,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt is not permissible for a man to shun his wife for this length of time, unless she is defiantly disobedient, meaning that she disobeys him and does not fulfil his rights. In that case, it is permissible to shun her until she repents, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{As for those women on whose part you fear defiant disobedience, [first] admonish them, [next] refuse to share their beds, [and last] hit them [lightly]. Then if they obey you, take no further action against them. Verily, Allah is Most High, Great}\xa0[an-Nisa’ 4:34].\nBut if these methods do not succeed in dealing with the defiant disobedience on the part of the wife, then the man should choose an arbitrator from his family and she should choose an arbitrator from her family, who can then examine the problem and decide on a solution, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{If you fear a breach between them, appoint an arbitrator from his family and another from hers; if they both want to put things right, Allah will bring about reconciliation between them. Verily, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Aware}\xa0[an-Nisa’ 4:35].\nBut if there is no defiant disobedience, it is not permissible to shun the wife in this way for two reasons:\n1.. The husband is obliged to keep his wife chaste, so he must have intercourse with her according to what she needs and according to what he is able to do.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about a man who is able to keep away from his wife for a month or two months without having intercourse with her; is he sinning or not? Should the husband be asked to have intercourse with her?\nHe replied: The man must have intercourse with his wife on a reasonable basis, and this is one of the most important rights that she has over him. It is more important than feeding her. With regard to what is obligatory in terms of intercourse, it was said that it is obligatory once every four months, or that it should be according to what she needs and according to what he is able to do, just as he should feed her according to what she needs and according to what he is able to do. The latter is the more sound of the two scholarly views.""(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa\xa0 32/271).\n2.. If he refuses to have intercourse with his wife – when there is no issue of defiant disobedience – for four months, he comes under the ruling on one who has vowed not to have intercourse with his wife. Therefore he should be ordered to have intercourse with her or to divorce her, and if he refuses to divorce her, the judge should issue a divorce.\nThe scholars of the Permanent Committee said: Regarding someone who shuns his wife for more than three months, if that is because of her defiant disobedience – meaning that she disobeys her husband with regard to the marital duties that are obligatory for her, and she persists in that after he admonishes her and reminds her to fear Allah, may He be exalted, and he reminds her of the duties that she must fulfil towards her husband – then he may shun her for as long as he wishes, so as to discipline her until she willingly fulfils her duties towards her husband. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) shunned his wives and did not visit any of them for a month. As for not speaking to her, it is not permissible for a man to ignore his wife for more than three days, because of the hadith that was narrated soundly from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) by Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which he said: “It is not permissible for a Muslim to shun his brother for more than three days.” Narrated by Imam al-Bukhari and Muslim in their Sahihs, and by Ahmad in his Musnad.\nWith regard to a husband forsaking his wife in bed for more than four months in order to cause harm to her, when there is no shortcoming on her part in fulfilling her husband’s rights, in this case he is like one who has vowed to keep away from his wife, even if he did not actually swear an oath to that effect. So the deadline of the vow to keep away from his wife (ila’) is to be set for him, then if four months passes without him going back to his wife and having intercourse with her in the vagina, when he is able to have intercourse, and she was not menstruating or bleeding following childbirth, then he is to be ordered to divorce her. If he refuses to go back to his wife and he refuses to divorce her, the judge should issue a divorce, or annul her marriage to him, if the wife requests that.\nAnd Allah is the source of strength. May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.

Then if he does not return, the judge may issue a verdict as he sees fit, either divorce or annulment of the marriage.\nIt is the same whether the husband’s travel and absence was for a valid reason, such as his need for money and there being no work available for him in his country, or there was no valid reason. But the difference between having a valid reason and not is that if the husband had a valid reason, he does not have to return and he is not sinning if he does not return.\nBut if he has no valid reason, then he must return, and he is sinning if he does not return.\nIn either case, the woman has the right to ask for a divorce, so as to ward off the harm that she is suffering. We have discussed this previously in the answer to question no. 102311 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/178188/he-shunned-his-wife-for-five-consecutive-months
105391,What are the situations in which Ghibah (backbiting or talking about others in their absence) is permitted?,"['Praise be to Allah.The scholars have stated that Ghibah is permitted in certain situations :\xa0\n\nComplaining . It is permissible for the one who has been wronged to complain to the ruler or judge and others who have the authority or ability to settle the score with the one who wronged him.\xa0\n\n\nSeeking help to change evil and bring the sinner back to the right path, so he may say to the one who he hopes is able to do something: “So and so is doing such and such; tell him not to do it.”\xa0\n\n\nSeeking advice or a Fatwa (religious ruling), by saying to the scholar, “So and so/my father/my brother has wronged me by doing such and such, does he have the right to do that? How can I solve this problem and ward off his harm from me?”\xa0\n\n\nWarning the Muslims of someone’s evil, such as highlighting the weakness of some reporters or witnesses or authors. That also includes seeing someone buying faulty goods, or someone keeping company with one who is a thief or adulterer, or giving a female relative of his to such a man in marriage, and the like. You should tell them about that by way of sincere advice, not with the aim of causing harm and spreading mischief.\xa0\n\n\nIf a person openly commits evil or follows Bid`ah (innovation), such as drinking alcohol and seizing people’s wealth unlawfully, it is permissible to speak of what he is doing openly, but it is not permissible to speak against him any other way, unless it is for another reason. \xa0\n\n\nFor identification, if someone is known by a nickname such as the dim-sighted one, or the blind man or the one-eyed or the lame one, it is permissible to identify him as such, but it is impermissible to mention that by way of belittling him, and if it is possible to identify him in some other way, that is better.\xa0\n\nIt says in Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah lil-Ifta’:\xa0\n“Speaking about a person in his absence is permissible in certain situations as indicated by Shar`i Islamic legal) evidence, if there is a need for that, such as if someone consults you about arranging a marriage to him, or entering into a business partnership with him, or if someone complains to the authorities to put a stop to his wrongdoing. In that case there is nothing wrong with saying things about him that he may not like to be said, because there is an interest to be served by that. One of the scholars summed up in two lines of poetry the situations in which it is permissible to talk about a person in his absence, and said:\xa0\nCriticizing is not Ghibah in six (cases) – complaining, identifying, warning,\nWhen the person is committing evil openly, when advice is sought, and when one is asking for help in removing an evil.”\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/105391/when-is-backbiting-allowed-in-islam
505019,"The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There are three whose supplication is not rejected… the fasting person when he breaks his fast.” Does the time specified by the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) end as soon as the time for Maghrib begins, or does it end when the fasting person breaks his fast, even if he delays breaking his fast until sometime after the adhan?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There are three whose supplication is not rejected: the just ruler, the fasting person until he breaks his fast, and the supplication of one who is wronged, which rises above the clouds and the gates of the heavens are opened for it, and the Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, says: ‘By My glory, I shall help you (against the wrongdoer), even if it is after a while.” Narrated by Ahmad in al-Musnad (13/410); at-Tirmidhi (3598) and Ibn Majah (1752).\nAt-Tirmidhi said: This is a hasan hadith. It was classed as hasan by al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar, as stated in al-Futuhat ar-Rabbaniyyah by Ibn ‘Allan (4/338). It was classed as sahih on the basis of corroborating reports by the commentators on al-Musnad.\nIbn Hibban narrated it in al-Ihsan (8 /214) under the chapter heading: The hope that the supplication of the fasting person at the time of breaking his fast will be answered. End quote.\nIbn Majah (1753) narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘As said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There is a supplication that will not be rejected for the fasting person when he breaks his fast.”\nThe commentators on as-Sunan said:\nIts isnad is hasan. End quote.\nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 26879 .\nSecondly:\nThese hadiths may be understood as referring to the breaking of the fast as mentioned in the religious texts, which is when the time for breaking the fast begins with the setting of the sun.\nOr it may be that what is referred to is the actual breaking of the fast, by eating or drinking, even if that is some time after sunset.\nThe second view is the one that is more likely to be correct.\nAl-Kamal ad-Dumayri (may Allah have mercy on him) said: In Ibn Majah (1753), it is narrated from Ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘As (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When the fasting person breaks his fast, he has a supplication that is answered.” And Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) used to say when breaking his fast: “O Allah, thirst is gone, the veins are moistened and the reward is certain if Allah wills. O Allah, O Oft-Forgiving, forgive me.”\nFrom the supplication mentioned, it may be understood that it is to be recited after breaking the fast. This is clear.\nEnd quote from an-Najm al-Wahhaj fi Sharh al-Minhaj (3/325).\nIbn ‘Allan (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Chapter: What is to be said when breaking the fast.\nIt says in al-Khadim: ash-Shafa‘i also stated that it is recommended to recite the dhikr mentioned when breaking the fast, but he did not explain whether it is to be recited before breaking the fast. His wording is more likely to mean that, and the word “aftartu (I have broken my fast)” could refer to when the fast is to be broken, which is when that time begins. All of that is possible. But what appears to be the case is that it may be after breaking the fast, or before, or whilst breaking the fast; it is all the same, [so whenever he recites this supplication], he will have done what is recommended. I say: What is proven is offering the supplication after breaking the fast.\nEnd quote from al-Futuhat ar-Rabbaniyyah ‘ala al-Adhkar an-Nawawiyyah (4/339).\nConclusion:\nIt is recommended for the fasting person to offer supplication, whether he hastens to break his fast or delays it, and whether he offers supplication after the time for breaking the fast begins and before he actually breaks his fast, or whilst he is breaking his fast, or after that. The matter is broad in scope, in sha Allah.\nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 293455 .\nBut it should be noted that the Sunnah is to hasten to break the fast, as has been explained previously in the answer to question no. 50019 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/505019/should-the-supplication-of-one-who-is-fasting-be-offered-when-the-time-for-breaking-the-fast-begins-or-when-he-actually-breaks-the-fast-even-if-that-is-delayed
11014,"We have heard that the `Awrah of a woman in front of other women is from the navel to the knees. Is this correct? Especially since in banquet halls we see women who come – may Allah keep us safe and sound – wearing short or see-through clothes, or garments with cut-away designs which show her calves, or they wear light and filmy garments, or things that leave a part of the chest or back uncovered… So Muslim women come out and they look like dancers in the non-Muslim countries or improperly-dressed actresses on the screen. If we tell them not to do that, they say, There is nothing wrong with that; women’s `Awrah is from the navel to the knee. Modesty has disappeared and women are becoming argumentative and imitating the non-Muslims, and the problem has reached overwhelming proportions. Please advise us, may Allah reward you.","['Praise be to Allah.`Awrah of women in front of men\nAll of a woman is `Awrah in front of non-Mahram men , and it is not permissible for her to appear before men even if she is covered, if there is the fear of fitnah (temptation) because of looking at her and seeing how tall she is and how she walks.\xa0\nA Woman’s `Awrah in Front of Women\nConcerning what was said about a woman’s `Awrah in front of other women being from the navel to the knee, this applies only when she is in her house among her sisters and the women of her household.\xa0\nThe basic principle is still that she should cover all of her body lest she be taken as an example and this evil practice become widespread among women.\xa0\nSimilarly, she must also cover her charms in front of her Mahrams and strange women lest some of her Mahrams be tempted by her or lest some of the women describe her to others.\nIt was reported in the Hadith that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No woman should describe another woman to her husband so that it is as if he can see her.”\xa0\nWhat this means is that if her charms, such as her chest, her shoulders, her stomach, her back, her arms, her neck and her calves, become visible, whoever sees that will inevitably have an impression of her, and usually women talk about what they have seen to their families, male and female alike. So a woman may mention that in front of non-Mahram men [i.e., men who are not Mahrams of the woman being described] in a manner that may provoke them to pursue her, or which may cause bad people to form an attachment to her.\nFor this reason, women have to cover their charms – such as their chests, backs, arms, calves, etc., - even in front of Mahrams and other women.\xa0\nObserving modesty in parties, schools, and hospitals\nThis covering becomes even more essential in parties, leisure facilities, hospitals and schools, even if there are only women present, because some non-Mahram men and adolescent boys may see them or take pictures of them naked which will be a cause of temptation to those who see them.\xa0\nA Warning to Women against making Wanton Displays\nA stern warning has been issued to those who make a wanton display of themselves and wear see-through or tight clothing, when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:\n“There are two kinds of the people of Hell … women who are clothed yet naked, walking with an enticing gait with something on their heads looking like the humps of camels, leaning to one side. They will not enter Paradise or even smell its fragrance.”\xa0\nWhat this means is that they are wearing see-through or tight clothes which show the size of their frame, or there are openings cut in the fabric which show their chests, breasts and other charms. This is widespread in parties and in general gatherings.\nFor more details, please see these answers:\xa043289 ,\xa026304 ,\xa0102187 ,\xa0310812 , 153367 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11014/a-womans-awrah-in-front-of-women
