509477,There is a man who is married to a Christian woman.,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt is not permissible to swear by anything or anyone except by Allah, may He be exalted, or one of His attributes, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever swears by something other than Allah has committed an act of shirk.” Narrated by Abu Dawud (3251) and by at-Tirmidhi (1535), who said: This is a hasan hadith. It was classed as authentic by al-Albani in Irwa’ al-Ghalil (8/189).\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAnother major sin is swearing by anything or anyone other than Allah, as the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever swears by something other than Allah has committed an act of shirk.” The one who said that this is disliked (makruh) has made a serious mistake, because the Lawgiver stated that it is shirk, therefore it is more serious than other major sins.""(I‘lam al-Muwaqqi‘in\xa0 6/571-572).\nThis hadith is general in meaning and applies to both Muslims and disbelievers, because the minor issues of sharia – meaning its rulings – are also addressed to the disbeliever. One of the rulings of sharia is that it is not permissible to swear by anything or anyone other than Allah.\nWali ad-Din al-‘Iraqi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe correct view on which the majority of scholars are agreed is that the minor issues of sharia are addressed to the disbelievers, so silk is prohibited for them as it is for the Muslims.(Tarh at-Tathrib\xa0 3/227).\nBased on that, it is not permissible for anyone to ask another person to swear by someone other than Allah, even if the one who is being asked to swear the oath is not Muslim. Therefore it is not permissible to ask him to swear by his god that he believes in and venerates.\nThe scholars stated that if a disbeliever is required to swear an oath, he should only swear by Allah, such as the Jews, Christians and Zoroastrians, and even the atheists who do not believe in the existence of Allah. They should not be asked to swear by anyone except Allah.\nKhalil ibn Ishaq al-Maliki (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his Mukhtasar (p. 228):\nAn oath to establish rights should be sworn by Allah besides Whom there is no god worthy of worship, even if he [the person being asked to swear the oath] is a Jew or a Christian. End quote.\nAl-Kharashi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his Sharh (7/237):\nThe well-known view is that the Jew or Christian should say this phrase, just like a Muslim, when swearing an oath.\nAs for a Zoroastrian, he should swear by Allah only. End quote.\nIbn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nFor both Muslims and disbelievers, oaths should be sworn by Allah, may He be exalted, because no one should swear by anyone except Him, because He, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {and let them both swear by Allah} [al-Ma’idah 5:106]. And because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever wants to swear an oath, let him swear by Allah or remain silent.”""(Al-Mughni\xa0 14/223).\nAl-Haskafi al-Hanafi (may Allah have mercy on him said in al-Durr al-Mukhtar (11/617):\nThe idol worshipper should swear by Allah, may He be exalted, because he acknowledges Him, even if he worships someone else.\nIbn al-Kamal stated that the Dahris do not believe in Allah, may He be exalted.\nI say: Based on that, then how could they swear an oath? End quote.\nThis question was answered by ‘Ala’ ad-Din in Takmilah Haashiyah Ibn ‘Abidin, where he said:\nI say, they should swear by Allah, may He be exalted, because of what was narrated from al-Mabsut in Mi‘raj ad-Dirayah: Free and slave, men and women, evildoers and righteous, disbelievers and Muslims are all the same with regard to swearing oaths, because the purpose here is to pass a judgement, and they all believe that swearing a false oath is prohibited.""(Takmilah Hashiyah Ibn ‘Abidin\xa0 11/618).\nAl-Qadi Shihab ad-Din ibn Abi’d-Dam ash-Shafa‘i said in his book Adab al-Qada’ (1/553, 554):\nIf the one who is swearing an oath is a Dahri who does not believe in any Creator or God, make him swear by Allah, the Creator, the Provider.\nIf it is said that that will not deter him from telling lies, so what benefit is there in it?\nOur response is that there are two benefits in that:\nFirstly, we will be able to pass our judgement concerning them. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): {And judge, [O Muhammad], between them by what Allah has revealed and do not follow their inclinations} [al-Ma’idah 5:49].\nSecondly, he will increase in sin by this oath and will be punished because of the sin, so he may hasten his own punishment by way of (divine) vengeance. End quote.\nThirdly:\nIf a Muslim asks a non-Muslim to swear by his own god, not intending thereby to venerate that god, then he has done something prohibited, but it does not constitute major disbelief (kufr akbar).\nThat is because swearing by something other than Allah constitutes minor disbelief (kufr asghar), not major disbelief.\nBut it may constitute major disbelief if he intended to venerate that god as he venerates Allah, or more.\nUsually the Muslim who does that is either unaware of the prohibition on doing that, or he justifies it on the basis of his thinking that it is permissible in the case of a disbeliever, so that he will not tell lies.\nIn these two cases, the Muslim is not sinning, but after he comes to know the Islamic ruling, he must refrain from doing that, and should not ask anyone to swear an oath by anything or anyone except by Allah.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/509477/is-it-permissible-to-ask-a-non-muslim-to-swear-by-what-he-venerates
59957,What is the ruling on clasping the hands when praying?,"['Praise be to Allah.Ruling on clasping the hands when praying\xa0\nClasping the hands when praying means placing the right hand over the left when standing . This is one of the sunnahs of prayer, and is proven from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). This is the view of the majority of scholars.\xa0\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“As for placing the right hand on the left during prayer, it is one of the sunnahs of prayer according to the majority of scholars. That was narrated from `Ali, Abu Hurayrah, An-Nakha`i, Abu Majlaz, Sa`id ibn Jubayr, Ath-Thawri, Ash-Shafi`i and Ashab Ar-Ra`i. It was also narrated by Ibn Al-Mundhir from Malik.” (Al-Mughni, 1/281)\xa0\nThe scholars of the Standing Committee said: \xa0\n“Clasping the hands in prayer means placing the right hand over the left hand, and letting the arms hang means letting them hang down by the sides . It is proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) placed his right hand on his left during prayer, when standing to recite Quran, and when standing after rising from bowing. This is according to the report narrated by Ahmad and Muslim from Wa’il ibn Hajar (may Allah be pleased with him), that he saw the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) raising his hands and saying Takbir when he started to pray, then he wrapped his cloak around himself, then he placed his right hand on his left. When he wanted to bow, he brought out his hands, then he raised them and said Takbir , then he bowed. When he said “Sami`a Allahu liman hamidah (Allah hears the one who praises Him)” he raised his hands , and when he prostrated, he prostrated between his hands.” According to a report narrated by Ahmad and Abu Dawud he said: Then he placed his right hand on his left hand, wrist and forearm. According to a report narrated by Abu Hazim from Sahl ibn Sa`d Al-Sa`idi: The people were commanded to place the right hand on the left forearm when praying. Abu Hazim said: All I know is that he attributed it to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). (Narrated by Ahmad and Al-Bukhari)\xa0\nThere is no Hadith to prove that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) let his arms hang by his sides when standing during prayer.” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah)\xa0\nWhere to place your hands in prayer\nAs for where the hands are to be placed, it is on the chest.\xa0\nIbn Khuzaymah (479) narrated that Wa’il ibn Hujr (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I prayed with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and he placed his right hand over his left hand on his chest.\xa0(Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Tahqiq Sahih Ibn Khuzaymah)\xa0\nAl-Albani said in Sifat Salat An-Nabi (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), p. 69:\xa0\n“Placing them (the hands) on the chest is what is established in the Sunnah, and doing otherwise is either weak (based on weak evidence) or has no basis.”\nAs-Sindi said in Hashiyat Ibn Majah:\xa0\n“Just as it is Sunnah to clasp the hands and not let them hang by one’s sides, it is proven that they are to be placed in the chest, not elsewhere. As for the Hadith “It is Sunnah to place one hand over the other beneath the navel when praying”, the scholars agree that it is inauthentic.”\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin said:\xa0\n“This method – i.e., placing the hands beneath the navel – is what is prescribed according to the well known view of the madhhab, and there is a Hadith narrated from `Ali which says “It is Sunnah to place the right hand over the left beneath the navel when praying.” It was narrated by Abu Dawud and classed as inauthentic by An-Nawawi, Ibn Hajar and others.\xa0\nSome scholars are of the view that the hands may be placed above the navel. This was stated by Imam Ahmad.\xa0\nOther scholars are of the view that they should be placed on the chest, and this is the most correct view. There is some debate concerning the evidence\xa0 for that but the apparent meaning of the Hadith of Sahl ibn Sa`d which is in Al-Bukhari supports the idea that the hands should be placed on the chest. The best report concerning this issue, even though there is some debate concerning it, is the Hadith of Wa’il ibn Hujr who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to put (his hands) on his chest.” \xa0(Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti`, 3/36, 37)\xa0\nHow are the hands placed on the chest in prayer?\nAs for the manner in which the hands are placed , there are two ways:\xa0\n\nPlacing the right hand on top of the left hand, wrist and forearm\nClasping the right hand over the left\n\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/59957/where-to-place-your-hands-in-prayer
315954,"We live in a western country, where there are restaurants which sell pizza meals of different types, and they also sell types of pizza with pieces of pork. Of course we only order cheese or vegetable pizza, but the problem is that the workers do not wash their hands every time they have touched pork, and when someone who is not Muslim orders a pizza that has pork and vegetables, for example, the worker touches the pork, and after that he touches some vegetables and puts his hand in them, and he may touch some other wet things in the restaurant, to which the impurity of the pork could be transferred, as the vegetables are naturally wet. My question is: do the other pieces of vegetables and pieces of cheese become impure, which the worker’s hand may or may not have touched? On that basis, is it haram to eat the pizza on which there is nothing except cheese or cheese and vegetables? Finally, we always ask the worker to wash his hands and to wash the knife and other things, before cutting the pizza.","['Praise be to Allah.Pork is impure according to scholarly consensus, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Say, ""I do not find within that which was revealed to me [anything] forbidden to one who would eat it unless it be a dead animal or blood spilled out or the flesh of swine - for indeed, it is impure - or it be [that slaughtered in] disobedience, dedicated to other than Allah}\xa0[al-An‘am 6:145].\nIf the worker touches the pork, then put his hand in the wet vegetables, that makes them impure. Similarly, if he cuts a pizza on which there is pork with a knife, then uses the knife before washing it to cut another pizza, that makes it impure, and it is well known that it is not permissible to eat food that is contaminated with impurity.\nThe basis for that is the report narrated by al-Bukhari (5478) and Muslim (1930) from Abu Tha‘labah al-Khushani, who said: I said: O Prophet of Allah, we are in the land of some of the People of the book; can we eat from their vessels? He said: “If you can find other vessels, then do not eat from them, but if you cannot find other vessels, then wash them and eat from them.”\nThis is to be understood as referring to someone who uses their vessels in which there are impurities, as in the version of this hadith narrated by Abu Dawud (3839): We live close to some the people of the Book and they cook pork in their pots and drink wine in their vessels. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If you can find something else, eat and drink from it. If you cannot find anything else, then wash them with water and eat and drink.”\nThe scholars of the Permanent Committee for Ifta’ were asked: Some restaurants grill beef on the same hotplate as pork. Is it permissible to eat that meat? Similarly, they use the same knife to cut the meat.\nThey replied: It is not permissible to eat beef that is grilled on the same hotplate as pork. The same applies to the knife.""(Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah\xa022/285).\nPlease see the answers to question no. 465771 .\nIf you are certain that the worker washes his hands before touching the vegetables and dough, and he washes the knife before cutting the pizza, it is permissible to eat those foods that are permissible.\nIf you are uncertain about that, it is not permissible, because the basic principle is that the impurity remains on his hand and on the knife after touching the pork, and this uncertainty cannot be dispelled unless you are certain that he has washed both.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/315954/is-it-permissible-to-eat-pizza-if-it-has-been-cut-with-a-knife-that-was-used-for-cutting-pork
