132499,"A young man wants to marry his sister’s friend, and he asked his sister to show him her picture because he wants to see her hair, and he is insisting on that. Please note that he is a religiously-committed young man and he really wants to get married and not play about. He chose this girl because he knows of her good character, but he does not know how she looks, and he does not want to approach her family and conclude the matter before seeing her, because he may not like how she looks after concluding the matter and that would hurt her feelings. Can his sister show him a picture of her without hijab, without the other girl knowing about it?","['Praise be to Allah.The basic principle regarding one who wants to propose to a woman is that he should look at her directly, not look at her picture. In the answer to question no. 4027 , we quoted from Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) that it is not allowed to send the woman’s picture to the suitor, and he mentioned some of the negative consequences that are likely to result from that. But it seems that there is little risk of these negative consequences in a case such as yours, so there is nothing wrong with you looking at her picture, because if it is permissible for you to see her directly, then it is more appropriate to say that it is permissible for you to see her picture. But it is essential to pay attention to the following conditions and guidelines:\n1.\xa0You should definitely intend to propose marriage. If you are hesitant, it is not permissible for you to look at her or at her picture, because Islam has only permitted looking for the suitor.\n2.\xa0What should be visible in the picture is the woman’s face and hands, and what would normally be uncovered in front of her mahrams, such as the head and neck, because that is the limit of what it is permissible for the suitor to see of the woman to whom he is proposing.\nIf anything more than that is visible in the picture, it is not permissible for you to look at it.\n3.\xa0Your seeing the picture should be through a trustworthy intermediary. It is not permissible for the woman to send her picture to the suitor so that he can see it, because of the negative consequences that may result from that.\n4.\xa0The matter should be limited to seeing the picture only, and there is nothing wrong with looking repeatedly at it, but it is not permissible for the suitor to keep this picture, and it is not permissible for the intermediary to allow him to do that.\n5.\xa0No man other than the suitor should see this picture.\nWith regard to the suitor seeing the woman or her picture it is not stipulated that the girl should give her permission.\nNevertheless, looking directly at the woman remains the basic principle, and it is what is preferred, because a picture does not really show reality as it is, in many cases.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/132499/he-wants-his-sister-to-show-him-a-picture-of-her-friend-so-that-he-can-propose-to-her
212705,"I am a single man, working for a company in Dubai, and I have a good income. I got a job in this company with a two-year contract, and I do not have any intention of extending this contract. Right now I am at the stage of looking for a wife. Is it essential for me to tell a future wife that this job of mine is temporary?","['Praise be to Allah.What we think is that you should tell the woman to whom you want to propose about your contract with the company and what you intend to do, because people may have different attitudes regarding such matters. Perhaps the woman will accept that, or her guardians will accept for her to marry you, because they think that you will continue in this job, which will guarantee you a good income, and if they knew that your work there is temporary, or they knew that you want to leave it, perhaps they would not accept that situation.\nYou may be rewarded for that too, if you intend thereby to show sincerity towards the woman, so that she will agree to marry with full awareness of the situation.\nBut if she asks you, in that case you must tell her the truth and not deceive her.\nIt was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever bears weapons against us is not one of us, and whoever deceives us is not one of us.”\xa0 Narrated by Muslim (164).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/212705/ruling-on-telling-his-potential-fiancee-details-about-his-work
