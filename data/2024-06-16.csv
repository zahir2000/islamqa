357385,"Is the one who could have asked about the ruling on some action, but did not ask, regarded as if proof was established against him? For example, if he is not sure whether doing something is a sin or not, then he decided not to ask about the ruling on it, is there any sin on him if he goes ahead and does that thing, when that thing is a sin? If possible, please refer to scholarly views on this issue, and say which you think is most likely to be correct, if there is no consensus on the matter.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nWhat the Muslim must do is learn before he acts. So it is not permissible for him to go ahead and do something when he does not know the ruling on it. That becomes more important if he is not sure whether that thing is a sin or not.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And do not pursue that of which you have no knowledge. Indeed, the hearing, the sight and the heart - about all those [one] will be questioned}\xa0[al-Isra’ 17:36].\nShaykh Muhammad al-Amin ash-Shinqiti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIn this verse, Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, forbids pursuing that of which one has no knowledge… That includes speaking without knowledge, or doing some actions about which one has no knowledge. And Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, refers to this meaning in other verses.""(Adwa’ al-Bayan\xa0 3/682).\nImam al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his Sahih:\nChapter: Learning before speaking or acting, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {So know, [O Muhammad], that there is no god worthy of worship except Allah} [Muhammad 47:19]; thus He began with knowledge.\nThe scholars are the heirs of the prophets, who left behind a legacy of knowledge. Whoever acquires that knowledge has taken an abundant share, and whoever follows a path seeking knowledge, Allah will make easy for him a path to Paradise.\nAllah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Only those fear Allah, from among His servants, who have knowledge}\xa0[Fatir 35:28]\n{But none will understand them except those of knowledge}\xa0[al-‘Ankabut 29:43]\n{And they will say, “If only we had been listening or reasoning, we would not be among the companions of the Blaze”}\xa0[al-Mulk 67:10]\n{Are those who know equal to those who do not know?}\xa0[az-Zumar 39:9].\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When Allah wills good for a person, He grants him understanding of religion” and “Knowledge is only acquired through learning.” Abu Dharr said: If you put this sword on here – and he pointed to the back of his neck – then I thought that I could convey a word I heard from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) before you kill me, I would convey it.\nIbn ‘Abbas said: Be pious scholars of the Lord, possessed of forbearing and understanding. It was said that the pious scholar [rabbani] is the one who starts by teaching people easy issues of knowledge before difficult issues.\nIbn Majah narrated that Anas ibn Malik said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Seeking knowledge is obligatory for every Muslim.”\nIbn ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIt was narrated that Ishaq ibn Rahawayh said: Seeking knowledge is obligatory, although there is no soundly-narrated report which says that. But what is meant is that the individual must seek the knowledge of how to do what he needs to do, such as wudu’ and prayer, zakah if he has wealth, and also Hajj and so on…\nAbu ‘Umar said: Ishaq meant – and Allah knows best – that regarding the hadith about the obligation to seek knowledge, there are some reservations among the scholars of hadith about its isnad, but its meaning is correct in their view…\nThen he narrated with his isnad from ‘Ali ibn al-Hasan ibn Shaqiq that the latter said: I said to Ibn al-Mubarak: What is the thing that the believer cannot do unless he seeks knowledge about it? And what must he learn? He said: He cannot take any action except on the basis of knowledge, and he cannot acquire knowledge unless he asks.""(Jami‘ Bayan al-‘Ilm wa Fadlihi\xa0 1/52-56).\nThis is a matter on which the scholars are agreed.\nAl-Qarafi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAl-Ghazali narrated in Ihya’ ‘Ulum ad-Din that there was consensus on that. Ash-Shafa‘i also narrated in ar-Risalah that it is not permissible for the accountable person to take any action until he knows the ruling of Allah concerning it. So the one who becomes involved in buying and selling must learn the rulings and guidelines that Allah has prescribed with regard to buying and selling. The one who gets involved in renting and hiring must learn what Allah, may He be exalted, has prescribed with regard to renting and hiring. The one who wants to lend or borrow money must learn the rulings that Allah, may He be exalted, has prescribed with regard to lending and borrowing. The one who wants to offer a particular prayer must learn the rulings that Allah, may He be exalted, has prescribed for that prayer. The same applies to purification and all other words and deeds.""(Al-Furuq\xa02/275).\nAl-Bukhari (2964) narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said:\n… One of you will be fine so long as he fears Allah. If he has any doubt about something, he should ask a man who will give him an answer.\nIbn al-Mulaqqin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nRegarding his words “If he has any doubt about something, he should ask a man who will give him an answer,” what he means is that part of fearing Allah is not doing anything that you are unsure of until you ask someone who has knowledge about that, so that he can give you an answer regarding it.""(At-Tawdih\xa0 18/81).\nAsh-Shatibi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If one who follows a scholar is faced with some religious issue, he has no option but to ask about it, and that is the general ruling, because Allah did not ask the people to worship Him on the basis of ignorance; rather He asked them to worship Him on the basis of the verse in which He, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning): {So fear Allah, for it is Allah Who teaches you} [al-Baqarah 2:282]. It is not in the way in which many people interpret this verse; rather, according to the understanding of leading scholars of Arabic language, it means: Allah will teach you about whatever issue you are faced with, so fear Him. It is as if the second thing mentioned (teaching) will lead to the first thing mentioned (taqwa or fear of Allah). So the issue of taqwa (fear of Allah) is connected to the condition, which is that you should acquire knowledge. This means that knowledge comes before actions. There is a great deal of evidence to support this meaning, and this is a matter concerning which there is no dispute among the scholars, so there is no need to discuss it at length.""(Al-Muwafaqat\xa0 5/283).\nSecondly:\nIf someone is required to ask and learn, but he fails to ask about what he is not sure of with regard to his religion by way of negligence, laziness and following whims and desires, then he is undoubtedly being heedless about his religion and exposing himself to punishment.\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe one who is able to ask, seek guidance and learn about the truth, but he fails to do that because he is preoccupied with worldly matters, pursuit of leadership, seeking pleasure, making money and so on, is heedless and deserves the punishment, and he is sinning by neglecting what is required of him, which is fearing Allah as much as he can. The ruling in his case is the same ruling as that on others like him who neglect some obligatory duties.""(At-Turuq al-Hukmiyyah\xa0 1/465).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhat is required of the individual is not to delay asking people of knowledge, because the more he delays asking, the more he will increase in sin, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{So [O people] ask those who have knowledge, if you do not know}\xa0[an-Nahl 16:43].\nSo what the individual must do is ask first, before taking action. If it so happens that he acts, then becomes uncertain, then he must hasten to ask.""(Fatawa Nur ‘ala ad-Darb\xa08/315).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/357385/what-is-the-ruling-on-going-ahead-and-doing-something-without-asking-about-the-ruling-on-it
45684,"We are from Jeddah and after Hajj, some of those who were with us said that the people of Jeddah do not have to do the Farewell Tawaf. What should we do?","[""Praise be to Allah.Is Farewell Tawaf compulsory?\xa0\nThe Farewell Tawaf is obligatory for the one who wants to leave Makkah after completing the rituals of Hajj, because Al-Bukhari (1755) and Muslim (1328) narrated that Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The people were commanded that the last thing they should do should be to circumambulate the House, but this was waived in the case of menstruating women.\xa0\nAl-Hafidh (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Fat-h:\xa0\n“This indicates that the Farewell Tawaf is obligatory, because the command is confirmed and because it is waived in the case of menstruating women; and a thing can only be waived if it is first confirmed.”\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said something similar in Sharh Muslim.\xa0\nThe scholars differed concerning those for whom the Farewell Tawaf is obligatory. Some of them said that it is obligatory for the one who is going to travel and pass the Miqat, but for those who live within the Miqat, the Farewell Tawaf is not obligatory.\xa0 (See Radd Al-Muhtar, 3/545)\nOthers were of the view that it is obligatory for anyone who is going to travel the distance at which it becomes permissible to shorten the prayers (approximately 80 kilometres), but for those who are travelling a shorter distance, it is not obligatory. Ash-Shafi`i and Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on them) were of the view that it is obligatory for everyone who is going to travel from Makkah and exit the city.\xa0\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Majmu` (8/236):\xa0\n“We narrated from Al-Baghawi that the Farewell Tawaf is required of everyone who wants to leave Makkah and travel the distance at which it becomes permissible to shorten the prayers. He said: if a person wants to travel for less than that distance, he does not have to do the Farewell Tawaf. But the correct and well known view is that it is required of the one who wants to travel the distance at which it becomes permissible to shorten the prayers or less, whether that is a short or long distance, because of the general meaning of the Hadith.”\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Mughni (5/337):\xa0\n“If a person's home is in the Haram, then he is like a Makkan and does not have to do the Farewell Tawaf . If a person's home is outside the Haram, but close to it, then the apparent meaning of Al-Khuraqi`s words is that he should not depart until he has bid Farewell to the House. This is the view of Abu Thawr and is similar to what Malik said, and is based on the general meaning of the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “No one should leave until the last thing he has done is to circumambulate the House.” And because he is leaving Makkah, he must bid Farewell, like one who lives far away.” End quote.\xa0\nIs the Farewell Tawaf Obligatory for the People of Jeddah?\nThe view that the people of Jeddah do not have to do the Farewell Tawaf was stated by some scholars, but the correct view is that it is obligatory for them. Based on that, those who did not do it have to offer a sacrifice (a sheep or one-seventh of a cow) to be slaughtered in Makkah and its meat distributed among the poor of the Haram. The same applies to everyone who omitted one of the obligatory parts of the Hajj rituals.\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Whoever lives in Jeddah must not leave Makkah until he has bid Farewell.” (Majmu` Fatawa Ibn `Uthaymin, 23/353)\xa0\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about some people from Jeddah who did not do the Farewell Tawaf and went back to Jeddah.\xa0\nHe replied:\xa0\n“Their Hajj is valid, but they have done wrong by omitting to bid Farewell, because the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded the pilgrim to bid Farewell, and said: \xa0“No one should leave until the last thing he has done is to circumambulate the House.”\xa0\xa0\nThis command, which is addressed to the pilgrims, includes the people of Jeddah and others. So all the people from other cities – whether they come from Jeddah or At-Ta`if or anywhere else – should bid Farewell to the House.\nSome scholars granted a dispensation to those whose homes are closer than the distance at which is becomes permissible to shorten the prayers, such as the people of Bahrah etc, and said that they do not have to bid Farewell, but in order to be on the safe side, everyone who comes from outside the sanctuary should bid Farewell when his Hajj is over. The people of Jeddah live far away, as do the people of At-Ta`if, so they should bid Farewell before they leave, because the Hadith applies to them too. They should offer a sacrifice to be slaughtered in Makkah for each of them who did not do the Farewell Tawaf , the meat of which should be distributed to the poor, a sheep or one-seventh of a camel or one-seventh of a cow” (Majmu` Fatawa Ibn Baz, 17/394)\nIt says in Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 11/303:\xa0\n“If you do Hajj then you should not travel to Jeddah after your Hajj until you have done the Farewell Tawaf; if you travel before bidding Farewell, then you have to offer a sacrifice to be slaughtered in Makkah, from which you should not eat, rather it should be distributed to the poor, because the Farewell Tawaf is obligatory after Hajj, because of the general meaning of the Hadith of Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him), who commanded the people that the last thing they should do should be to circumambulate the House, but this was waived in the case of menstruating women. (Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim) And you also have to repent to Allah for going out to Jeddah before doing the Farewell Tawaf.”\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45684/is-the-farewell-tawaf-obligatory-for-the-people-of-jeddah
398094,"Nowadays there is something that is called environmentally-friendly burial (“green” or “natural” burial that allows the body to decompose naturally, or “tree pod burial”). The way in which this burial is done is by placing the person in a biodegradable pod. The body is placed in the foetal position inside the pod, which is then buried in the ground and a small tree, chosen by the deceased or his relatives, is planted above the pod. What is meant is that this will be a new life for a soul by planting the tree, or a revival or bringing his life back. Usually the tree is of a long-lived variety, which with the passage of time will spread widely. What is the ruling on that?","['Praise be to Allah.With regard to the method of burial described in the question, and planting a tree as mentioned, none of that is permissible, because of what it involves of innovated ideas and introducing new things. Allah, may He be exalted, has prescribed that bodies are to be buried in the ground. This is what His prophets and messengers did, and no attention is to be paid to anyone who claims that this is harmful to the environment.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{From the earth We created you, and into it We will return you, and from it We will extract you another time}\xa0[Ta-Ha 20:55]\n{Have We not made the earth a container,\nOf the living and the dead?}\xa0[al-Mursalat 77:25-26].\nAl-Baghawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his Tafsir (8/305): {a container [kifat]} is a vessel. What is meant by the root word al-kaft is bringing something together. Al-Farra’ said: What is meant is bringing the living together on the surface of the earth in their houses and homes, and bringing the dead together under the surface; in other words, containing them. End quote.\nAbu Dawud (3208), an-Nasa’i (2009), at-Tirmidhi (1045) and Ibn Majah (1554) narrated that Ibn ‘Abbas said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The niche (lahd) is for us and the trench (shaqq) in the ground is for others.”\nIt was also narrated by Ahmad (19158) from Jarir ibn ‘Abdillah al-Bajali; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud.\nThe lahd (niche) and shaqq (trench) are both in the ground, but the lahd is in the side of the grave. See the answer to question no. 103880 .\nSecondly:\nIt is not prescribed to plant trees on graves.\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is not prescribed to plant trees on graves, whether Indian figs or any other kind, or to sow barley or wheat or anything else on them, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not do that with graves, and neither did the Rightly-Guided Caliphs who succeeded him (may Allah be pleased with them).\nWith regard to what he did with the two graves when Allah informed him of the torment of their occupants, and he placed a palm branch on them, this is something that was only for those two graves, because he did not do that with any other graves.\nThe Muslims have no right to introduce any acts of worship or rituals that Allah has not prescribed, because of the hadiths quoted above, and because Allah, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Or have they other deities who have ordained for them a religion to which Allah has not consented?}\xa0[ash-Shura 42:21].""(Majmu‘ Fatawa ash-Shaykh Ibn Baz\xa0 5/407).\nAnd he (may Allah have mercy on him) said: That is not prescribed, rather it is an innovation, because the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) only put the palm branch on the two graves when Allah, may He be glorified, informed him of the torment being suffered by their occupants, and he did not place palm branches on any other graves. Thus it is known that it is not permissible to place them on graves, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever introduces anything into this matter of ours that is not part of it, it will be rejected.” According to a version narrated by Muslim: “Whoever does a deed that is not in accordance with this matter of ours, it will be rejected.”\nSimilarly, it is not permissible to write on graves, or to place flowers on them, because of the two hadiths quoted above. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade plastering over graves, building structures over them, sitting on them and writing on them.""(Majallat al-Buhooth al-Islamiyyah\xa0 68/50).\nThis is in addition to the fact that the tree mentioned is not planted on the grave itself, and is not connected to the body of the deceased; rather the trees are planted between the graves, or the palm branches are placed on the graves; in either case, they are not connected to the body of the deceased person in his grave.\nAs for the way of planting trees that is mentioned, and saying or believing that this will be a new life for a soul by planting the tree, or a revival or bringing his life back, all of that is the misguidance of the people of ignorance, and it is more akin to deviant belief in the transmigration of souls. When life departs from a person, it will never come back to him until Allah resurrects those who are in the graves. His soul does not go to a tree or to an animal; rather the soul is with its Creator, Who will place it wherever He wills. It will not return to another body or to an animal or to a tree, according to the consensus of the Muslim scholars; rather those who say this and similar things are deviant people who believe in the transmigration of souls, and those who are influenced by them.\nFor more information, please see the answer\xa0to question\xa0no. 14379 \xa0.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/398094/what-is-the-ruling-on-environmentally-friendly-burial-tree-pod-burial
34744,"I am going to Makkah to do `Umrah, but I do not know any Du`as. Can you help me?","['Praise be to Allah.There are Du`as and Adhkar \xa0 narrated in the authentic Sunnah which you can recite during the rituals of `Umrah , and from which the Muslim can benefit by memorizing them, understanding them and acting upon them. These include the following:\xa0\nDu`a\xa0 at the Miqat\xa0\nIt is Sunnah for the Muslim to recite Tasbih (saying “Subhan-Allah (glory be to Allah)”), Tahlil (saying “La ilaha illallah (there is none worthy of worship but Allah)”) and Takbir (saying “Allahu akbar (Allah is Most Great)”) before entering Ihram for `Umrah or Hajj.\xa0\nIt was narrated that Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prayed Dhuhr with four Rak`ahs when we were with him in Madinah, and he prayed `Asr in Dhu`l-Hulayfah with two Rak`ahs, then he stayed there overnight. When morning came he rode until he reached Al-Bayda’, then he praised, glorified and magnified Allah. Then he recited Talbiyah with the intention of performing Hajj and `Umrah and the people did likewise.\xa0(Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 1476)\xa0\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“This ruling – that it is recommended to recite Tasbih and the other (Adhkars) mentioned before Ihram – is something that not many people do even though it is proven in the Sunnah.” (Fat-h Al-Bari, 3/412)\xa0\nDu`a\xa0 on the way to Makkah\xa0\nIt is Sunnah to recite the Talbiyah a great deal and to raise one`s voice – for men; women should recite in a low voice so that no non-Mahram men will hear them.\xa0\nIt was narrated from `Abdullah ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that when the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) set out riding from the mosque of Dhul-Hulayfah, he recited the Talbiyah and said: “Labbayk Allahumma labbayk , labbayka la sharika laka labbayk, inna Al-hamda wa`l-ni`matah laka wal-mulk, la sharika lak (Here I am, O Allah, in response to your call, here I am. Here I am, in response to your call, You have no partner, here I am. Verily all praise and grace and dominion are Yours, You have no partner).”\xa0(Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 5571 and Muslim, 1184)\xa0\nDu`a during Tawaf\xa0\nEvery time you come in line with the Black Stone in each circuit, say, “Allahu akbar.” Al-Bukhari (1613) narrated from Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) circumambulated the House, and every time he came to the corner (i.e., the Black Stone), he pointed to it with something he had in his hand and said Takbir .\xa0\nBetween the Yemeni Corner and the Black Stone you should say the words that were narrated from `Abdullah ibn As-Sa’ib (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say between the two Corners: “Rabbana atina fid-dunya hasanah wa fil-akhirah hasanah wa qina `adhab An-nar (Our Lord, give us that which is good in this world and that which is good in the Hereafter, and protect us from the torment of the Fire).” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 1892; classed as sound by Shaykh Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud)\xa0\nDu`a before climbing up As-Safa and when atop it\xa0\nIt was narrated that Jabir ibn `Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: … then he (the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)) went out through the gate to As-Safa and when he drew near to As-Safa he recited: “Verily, As-Safa and Al-Marwah (two mountains in Makkah) are of the Symbols of Allah” [Al-Baqarah 2:158 – interpretation of the meaning], (and he said:) “I begin with that with which Allah began.” He began with As-Safa and climbed it until he could see the House, then he turned to face the Qiblah and proclaimed the Oneness of Allah and magnified Him, and said: “La ilaha illallah wahdahu la sharika lah, lahul-mulk wa lahul-hamd wa huwa `ala kulli shay’in qadir; La ilaha illallah wahdahu anjaza wa`dah wa nasara `abdah wa hazama Al-ahzaba wahdah (There is none worthy of worship but Allah alone, with no partner or associate, His is the dominion and to Him be praise, and He is able to do all things; there is none worthy of worship but Allah alone, He fulfilled His promises and granted victory to His slave and defeated the confederates alone).” Then he made Du`a between that and repeated this three times.\xa0(Narrated by Muslim, 1218)\xa0\nDu`a when climbing Al-Marwah\xa0\nYou should do the same as you did when climbing As-Safa, without reciting the verse before starting to climb.\xa0\nJabir (may Allah be pleased with him) said:\xa0 Then he came down towards Al-Marwah and when his feet reached the bottom of the valley he ran until the ground started to rise, then he walked until he came to Al-Marwah, and he did at Al-Marwah as he had done at As-Safa. (Narrated by Muslim, 1218)\xa0\nWhen drinking Zamzam water, you may say Du`a asking for the best of this world and the Hereafter, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The water of Zamzam is for whatever it is drunk for.” (Narrated by Ibn Majah, 3062; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in 5502)\xa0\nSimilarly it is prescribed to remember Allah a great deal (Dhikr), which includes Du`a, during Tawaf and Sa`i, so the Muslim should make Du`a as Allah inspires him. There is nothing wrong with reciting Quran during tawaf and Sa`i. What some people say, that there are special Du`as for each circuit of tawaf and Sa`i is something for which there is no basis in Shari`ah.\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“It is recommended during Tawaf to remember Allah and call upon Him in ways that are prescribed in Shari`ah. If one recites Quran there is nothing wrong with that. There is no specific Dhikr that has been narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), that he either enjoined, said or taught to others. Rather (the pilgrim) may say any Du`a that is prescribed in Shari`ah. What many people say, that there is a specific Du`a to be recited beneath the downspout of the Ka`bah and so on has no basis.\xa0\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to end his Tawaf between the two Corners by saying,\xa0 “Rabbana atina fid-dunya hasanah wa fil-akhirah hasanah wa qina `adhab An-nar (Our Lord, give us that which is good in this world and that which is good in the Hereafter, and protect us from the torment of the Fire),” as he used to finish all his Du`as with these words, and there is no specific Du`a for that, according to scholarly consensus.” (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 26/122, 123)\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34744/dua-during-umrah
