150659,"I divorced my wife three times during an argument that was very heated, when I had not consummated the marriage with her and had only done the marriage contract. What is the Islamic ruling: is this considered a divorce, or what should I do?","['Praise be to Allah.If a man divorces his wife three times in separate words, such as saying: “You are divorced, divorced, divorced” or “You are divorced and divorced and divorced,” a before consummating the marriage, it counts as a single irrevocable divorce according to the majority of scholars, because she becomes completely divorced from him with the uttering of the first word of divorce, and the subsequent words serve no purpose because she is not required to observe ‘iddah.\nSee: Bada’i‘ as-Sana’i‘ (3/137); Hashiyat Ibn ‘Abidin (3/287); Mughni al-Muhtaj (4/482); al-Mughni (7/367).\nIf he divorced her three times in a single phrase, such as saying, “You are thrice divorced,” then it counts as three, according to the majority of scholars. Some of the scholars are of the view that it counts as one divorce, and becomes completely divorced from him; however, because she was divorced before consummation of the marriage, she becomes permissible for him to marry with a new marriage contract. This is the view of ‘Ata’, Tawus, Sa‘id ibn Jubayr, Abu’sh-Sha‘tha’ and ‘Amr ibn Dinar. It is the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam and a number of contemporary scholars, including Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) and Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him).\nSee: al-Mughni (7/282); Fatawa ash-Shaykh Ibn Baz (21/430); ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘ (13/40).\nBased on that, if you divorced your wife before consummating the marriage, issuing three divorces even if that was in a single phrase, then she is divorced from you, but you can do a new marriage contract with a new mahr, after which two talaqs will remain.\nWhat you must do is beware of taking lightly the matter of issuing divorce (talaq), because of the consequences to which it may lead of ending the marriage and breaking it up without that being the intention of the one who issues the divorce.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/150659/he-divorced-her-three-times-before-consummating-the-marriage
303336,"I sent a question before, about dealing with the forex and avoiding leverage, and avoiding delayed payment. But you told me that immediate exchange is not possible in the forex, and after some research, I found that with the Exness company, the money will be withdrawn immediately to the online bank, such as Skrill Bank. But the problem is that the minimum leverage is 2, i.e., double, but it is possible to avoid leverage manually, by not setting up a deal of which the size is greater than the size of your wealth. What is the ruling on dealing in this manner?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nUsing financial leverage when dealing with an organisation means taking a loan from that organisation, hence there are two things that are prohibited in this case:\n\nTaking what is called the installation fee, because it is a stipulated increase on the loan, therefore it is riba.\nDoing transactions through this organisation, for which it will charge a fee, because this is brokerage. It is not valid to combine a loan and brokerage, or any other type of transaction, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “It is not permissible to arrange a loan combined with a sale.” Narrated by at-Tirmidhi (1234), Abu Dawud (3504) and an-Nisa’i (4611); classed as sahih by at-Tirmidhi and al-Albani.\n\nThe Islamic Fiqh Council issued a statement prohibiting trade in margins or the forex system. Please see the text of this statement in the answer to question no. 106094 .\nThe reasons for the prohibition mentioned by the council are:\n\nWhat it involves of blatant riba, which comes in the form of paying something additional to the loan, which is called installation fees. This comes under the heading of riba, which is prohibited.\nCombining a loan with another type of transaction.\nNot doing the exchange immediately in deals in which that is required, such as selling currencies and gold and silver. This comes under the heading of riba an-nasi’ah.\n\nThe council said: Buying and selling currencies is usually done without the exchange taking place immediately in such a way that one will have access to the funds straight away, as prescribed in Islamic teachings. End quote.\nBased on that:\nIf you dealt with your money only, and did not use financial leverage, then you have avoided both infractions.\nIf the exchange was done in the meeting in which you bought the currencies, then the transaction is permissible, because it is free of infractions.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/303336/ruling-on-dealing-with-forex-and-avoiding-leverage
