31807,"What are the actions which, if a Muslim does them, he will be an apostate from Islam?.","[""Praise be to Allah.Shaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn `Abdullah ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Note that Allah has commanded all people to enter Islam and to adhere to it and to beware of whatever is contrary to it. He sent His Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to call mankind to that. He tells us that those who follow him will be guided and that those who turn away from him have gone astray.\nIn many verses He warns against the means that lead to apostasy and all forms of polytheism and disbelief .\nThe scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) have said, when discussing apostasy, that a Muslim may apostatize from his religion by doing many acts that nullify Islam, which makes it permissible to shed his blood and seize his wealth, and which will put him beyond the pale of Islam.\xa0\nAmong the most serious and most common of these things are ten which were mentioned by Shaykh Muhammad ibn `Abd Al-Wahhaab and other scholars (may Allah have mercy on them all).\xa0\nWe will mention them in brief here, so that you and others can beware of them, in the hope that you will be safe and sound. We will also explain a little about them after mentioning each one. \xa0\n\nShirk or associating others in worship with Allah . Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n\n“Verily, Allah forgives not (the sin of) setting up partners (in worship) with Him, but He forgives whom He wills, sins other than that, and whoever sets up partners in worship with Allah, has indeed strayed far away.”\xa0[An-Nisa’ 4:116]\xa0\n“Verily, whosoever sets up partners (in worship) with Allah, then Allah has forbidden Paradise to him, and the Fire will be his abode.”\xa0[Al-Ma’idah 5:72]\nThat includes praying to the dead, seeking their help, making vows and offering sacrifices to them or to the jinn or to the grave.\xa0\n\nWhoever sets up intermediaries between himself and Allah and calls upon them, asks them to intercede, and puts his trust in them, is a disbeliever according to scholarly consensus.\xa0\nWhoever does not regard the polytheists as disbelievers, or doubts that they are disbelievers, or regards their way as correct, is a disbeliever.\xa0\nWhoever believes that anything other than the teaching of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is more complete than his teachings , or that the rulings of anyone else are better than his rulings – such as those who prefer the rule of false laws to his rulings – is a disbeliever.\xa0\nWhoever hates any part of that which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) brought, even if he acts in accordance with it, is a disbeliever, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n\n“That is because they hate that which Allah has sent down (this Quran and Islamic laws); so He has made their deeds fruitless.”\xa0[Muhammad 47:9]\n\nWhoever makes fun of anything in the religion of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), or makes fun of any texts that refer to rewards or punishments, is a disbeliever. The evidence for that is the verse (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n\n“Say: Was it at Allah, and His Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) and His Messenger that you were mocking?\nMake no excuse; you disbelieved after you had believed.”\xa0[At-Tawbah 9:65-66]\n\nWitchcraft – including spells to turn one person against another or to make someone love another. Whoever does this or approves of it is a disbeliever. The evidence for that is the verse (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n\n“but neither of these two (angels) taught anyone (such things) till they had said, `We are for trial, so disbelieve not (by learning this magic from us).’”\xa0[Al-Baqarah 2:102]\n\nSupporting the polytheists and helping them against the Muslims. The evidence for that is the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n\n“O you who believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians as Awliya’ (friends, protectors, helpers), they are but Awliyaa’ of each other. And if any amongst you takes them (as Awliya’), then surely, he is one of them. Verily, Allah guides not those people who are the Dhalimun (polytheists and wrongdoers and unjust)”\xa0[Al-Ma'idah 5:51]\n\nWhoever believes that some people are allowed to operate outside the law of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) just as Al-Khidr operated outside the law of Musa (peace be upon him) is a disbeliever, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n\n“And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers.”\xa0[Al `Imran 3:85]\n\nTurning away from the religion of Allah, not learning it and not acting in accordance with it. The evidence for that is the verse (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n\n“And who does more wrong than he who is reminded of the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of his Lord, then turns aside therefrom? Verily, We shall exact retribution from the Mujrimon (criminals, disbelievers, polytheists, sinners).”\xa0[As-Sajdah 32:22]\nWith regard to all of these acts that nullify Islam, it makes no difference whether a person is joking, serious or afraid, unless he is forced to do it. All of them are very serious, and they all happen a great deal.\xa0\nThe Muslim should beware of them and fear falling into them. We seek refuge with Allah from the things that may incur His wrath and painful punishment. May Allah send blessings and peace upon the best of His creation, Muhammad, and upon his family and companions.\xa0\n\nThe fourth category includes those who believe that the systems and laws devised by men are better than the Shari`ah of Islam, or equal to it; or that it is permissible to refer to them for judgements and rulings, even if he believes that referring to Shari`ah is better; or that the Islamic system is not fit to be applied in the twentieth century; or that it was the cause of the Muslims’ backwardness; or that it should be limited to a person’s relationship with his Lord and not have anything to do with the other affairs of life\xa0\nThe fourth category also includes those who think that carrying out the ruling of Allah by cutting off the hand of the thief or stoning the married adulterer is not appropriate in the modern age.\xa0\nThat also includes: everyone who believes that it is permissible to rule according to something other than the laws of Allah with regard to interactions, hudud punishments or other matters, even if he does not believe that that is better than the ruling of Shari`ah, because by doing so he is regarding as permissible something that Allah has forbidden according to consensus, and everyone who regards as permissible something that Allah has forbidden and is well known to be forbidden in Islam, such that no Muslim has any excuse for not knowing that it is forbidden, such as adultery , alcohol and Riba , and ruling by something other than the Shari`ah of Allah, is a disbeliever according to the consensus of the Muslims.\xa0\n\nWe ask Allah to help us all to do that which pleases Him, and to guide us and all the Muslims to His Straight Path, for He is All Hearing, Ever-Responsive.

300311,"One of the texts which prove it is permissible to wipe over the khuffs is the hadith of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), which is: It was narrated that al-Mugheerah ibn Shu‘bah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I was with the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on a journey. I bent down to take off his khuffs and he said: “Leave them, for I put them on when my feet were clean.” Then he wiped over them. The scholars say that one of the conditions of it being permissible to wipe over the khuffs is that they should have been put on when one was in a state of purity, referring to wudu’, based on this hadith. I do not understand this, because in the text of the hadith it says that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) put on the khuffs when his feet were clean, as he said. Does this refer to wudu’? Because his feet may have been clean without him having done wudu’, and he could have said, “Leave them, for I put them on when I was in a state of purity,” not “when my feet were clean.” I hope that you can give me an answer about this confusion. May Allah reward you with good.","['Praise be to Allah.The majority of jurists stipulated that in order for wiping over the khuffs to be permissible, they must have been put on when one was in a state of purity. They based that on the hadith of al-Mugheerah ibn Shu‘bah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: I was with the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on a journey. I bent down to take off his khuffs and he said: “Leave them, for I put them on when my feet were clean.” \xa0Narrated by al-Bukhari (206) and Muslim (274).\nDawud az-Zahiri (the literalist) was of the view that what is stipulated is that the feet should be clean only.\nWhat supports the view of the majority is the report narrated by ‘Abd ar-Razzaaq in his Musannaf (793), Ibn Khuzaymah (193) and Ibn Hibban (1325) from Safwan ibn ‘Assal (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: We were with the army that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) sent out. He ordered us to wipe over our khuffs, if we had put them on when in a state of purity, for three days when we were travelling, and for one night if we were not travelling, and not to take them off after defecating or urinating, and not to take them off except in the case of janabah. Classed as hasan by al-Albani and by Shu ‘ayb al-Arna’ut in Takhrij Ibn Hibban.\nAl-Bayhaqi narrated it in as-Sunan al-Kubra (1/423) as follows: If we had put them on in a state of purity.

End quote.\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar said: Even though the hadith of Safwan is sahih, it does not meet the conditions of al-Bukhari. But the hadith that is mentioned in al-Bukhari is in harmony with this hadith, which stipulates that one should be in a state of purity when putting them on.\nAl-Muzani was referring to a difference of opinion regarding this matter. In brief, al-Shafa‘i and the majority of scholars understood the references to cleanliness as meaning taharah (purity) in the shar‘i, ritual sense, i.e., wudu’, whilst Dawud disagreed and said: If there was no impurity (najasah) on the person’s feet when he put on the khuffs, it is permissible to wipe over them.""(Fath al-Bari\xa0 1/309).\nThus it becomes clear that the view of the majority is sound and their evidence is strong for stipulating that the khuffs should have been put on when in a state of purity.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/300311/what-is-the-evidence-for-stipulating-that-one-should-be-in-a-state-of-purity-before-putting-on-the-khuffs
259676,"Our Lord, may He be Glorified and Exalted, enjoins us in the Holy Quran to remember the blessings that Allah has bestowed upon us, numerous blessings, such as when He, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning]:","['Praise be to Allah.The command mentioned in the verse quoted by the questioner is a command to the Companions and the believers to remember the blessings of Allah and His grace towards them, and His kindness to them in causing the defeat of their enemies and frustrating their enemies’ plots.\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Here Allah, may He be Exalted, is speaking of His blessings, grace and kindness to His believing slaves when He averted their enemies and inflicted defeat upon them in the year when they came together and formed an alliance against them, which was the year of Al-Khandaq [the Trench]."" (Tafsir Ibn Kathir,\xa0 6/383)\nWhen there is a command in the Quran to remember Allah’s blessing, what is meant is to remember it in one’s heart, by calling to mind Allah’s grace and favour in bestowing it upon His slaves; remembering it in one’s words, by speaking of it; and remembering it in one’s physical actions, by not using that blessing in ways that incur the wrath of Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted.\nRemembering the blessing is giving thanks for it , and may be done in one’s heart, in one’s words or in one’s actions; each of them confirms the others, unless the gratitude is false.\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said, commenting on the verse (interpretation of the meaning): “And remember the favour of Allah upon you.” [Al-Baqarah 2:231]:\n“Remembering may be done in one’s heart, in one’s words and in one’s actions. Remembering it in one’s words means saying: Allah has blessed me with such and such, as Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “But as for the favour of your Lord, report [it]” [Ad-Duha 93:11]. So you should praise Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, for it by saying: O Allah, to You be praise for what you have blessed me with of wealth, or a wife, or children, and so on.\nRemembering it in one’s heart is by calling it to mind and acknowledging that it is a blessing from Allah.\nRemembering it in one’s actions is by striving to obey Allah, and by showing the effects of His blessing on you."" (Tafsir Surat Al-Baqarah\xa0 3/132)\nAl-Harawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “What is meant by gratitude is three things: acknowledging the blessing, then appreciating the blessing, then giving praise for it .”\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said, commenting on the words of Al-Harawi:\n“As for acknowledging it, that means calling it to mind, realising its significance and recognising it as a blessing in and of itself.\nSo acknowledging it is done in the mind.\nAppreciating it means showing humility when receiving it from the Bestower, by expressing one’s need for it and acknowledging that it came to him without him deserving it and without him paying any price; rather he sees himself as being completely dependent upon Allah. This attitude shows true appreciation.\n“then giving praise for it”: praise for the Bestower in connection with the blessing is of two types: general and specific.\nThe general type is ascribing to Him the attributes of generosity, kindness, munificence and so on.\nThe specific type is speaking of His blessing, and stating that it came to him from Him, as Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “But as for the favour of your Lord, report [it].” [Ad-Duha 93:11]\nRegarding this reporting or speaking of the blessing that is enjoined, there are two views:\nThe first is that it means mentioning the blessing and speaking of it, by saying: Allah has blessed me with such and such. Muqatil (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Give thanks for what Allah has mentioned of blessings to you in this surah, such as helping orphans, granting guidance after misguidance, and granting self-sufficiency after poverty.\nSpeaking of the blessings of Allah is gratitude , as in the Hadith of Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him): “Whoever has a favour done for him, let him reciprocate, and if he cannot reciprocate, then let him praise [the person who did him the favour], for if he praises him, then he has thanked him, but if he conceals it, then he has been ungrateful towards him. And whoever pretends to have what he has not been given is like one who wears two garments of falsehood.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari in Al-Adab Al-Mufrad, 215; classed as authentic by Al-Albani)\nThis Hadith mentions three types of people: one who is grateful for the blessing and gives praise for it; one who denies it and conceals it; and one who pretends to be one of those who were given it when that is not the case, so he pretends to have something that he was not given. In another report it says: “Whoever does not give thanks for a little will not give thanks for a great deal, and whoever does not show gratitude to people has not shown gratitude to Allah. Speaking of the blessing of Allah is gratitude, and not speaking of it is ingratitude. Unity is a mercy and division is a punishment.” [Narrated by ‘Abdullah ibn Ahmad in Zawa’id Al-Musnad, 18449; classed as sound by Al-Albani)\nThe second view is that speaking of the blessing that is enjoined in this verse [at the end of Surah Ad-Duha, quoted above] means calling people to Allah, conveying His message and teaching the Ummah. Mujahid (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It refers to Prophethood. Az-Zajjaj (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It means: Convey that with which you [O Prophet] have been sent, and speak of the Prophethood that Allah has bestowed upon you. Al-Kalbi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It refers to the Quran, which Allah commanded him to recite.\nThe correct view is that it includes both types, because each of them is a blessing for which it is enjoined to give thanks and speak of it. Manifesting it is part of being grateful for it."" (Madarij As-Salikin 2/237)\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said regarding gratitude:\n“It is based on three pillars: acknowledging it inwardly, speaking of it outwardly, and using it to earn the pleasure of the One Who granted it and bestowed it.""
