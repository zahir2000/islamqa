474431,"Is it permissible to give money to a number of people, approximately fifty, and give each one eight or ten cents in return for registering on some websites by email, whilst making sure that there is nothing Islamically objectionable on the website, and no scam or depositing money, and it is simply a survey website, or a platform for communications, and the website assigns some profit for me of approximately thirty cents for every person who registers through the link that I send to him, therefore I will have knowledge of how much profit I am going to get?","['Praise be to Allah.If what is meant is that the website will give you thirty cents if someone registers with them through your link, and in order to encourage people to register with the website through you, you say to them: Whoever registers through me and participates in a survey, I will give him eight cents or ten cents, then the answer is:\n1. With regard to yourself, if you get others to register with the website for free, and you are given that amount of money for anyone who registers through you, then there does not seem to be anything wrong with it, except for what we will mention below, at the end of the answer.\n2. With regard to the people you recruit, if the work expected of them is permissible – which is filling out a survey, checking the website or merely registering – and the payment is definitely known, whether it is eight cents or ten cents, and is not merely possible, and they can register with the website for free, then there is nothing wrong with that either.\nThe problem that may be there is if the website deceives investors, advertisers and the like, by showing them how many visitors, browsers and subscribers there are, to make them think that these people like the product, for example. In that case it is haram to work with this website, if it becomes clear that it is deceiving people, because in that case registering with it is helping in deception.\nIf what the question means is something other than what we have mentioned, then we hope you will explain it further, so that we can give an answer.\nFor the benefit of readers, we will list some guidelines on when it is permissible to earn money through websites, which are as follows:\n1. Registration with the website should be free.\n2. The content of the website, ads and otherwise, should be permissible.\n3. The work that is to be done should be known, such as clicking on ads, or completing a survey, in which case it is stipulated that you should answer truthfully.\n4. The commission should be known.\n5. The website should not be one that deceives investors, advertisers and the like about the number of visitors and browsers. If that is the case, it is haram to work with it, because that is helping in deceit.\n6. The individual should not try to cheat the website by making more than one account if that is contrary to the rules of the website, because of the prohibition on deceiving and cheating.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/474431/the-conditions-of-making-money-from-websites-and-platforms
127946,"I have a problem that is causing me to think a great deal and is making me frustrated. Approximately two months ago, I was able to do well in my exams to become a secondary school teacher, and now I am studying in a school that prepares teachers who specialise in English. I am studying in a mixed class composed of fifteen male students and fifteen female students. After that I will be appointed to teach in one of the secondary schools in my country. This secondary school is also mixed. What frustrates me in fact is that I know that mixing is forbidden, and that men are commanded to lower their gaze. But I tell myself that our country is not like other Muslim countries; moreover people who are religiously committed and righteous have to compete to attain these positions so as to bar the way to those who promote innovation and sin. Now I do not know whether I will be rewarded for what I am doing, or whether the Shaytan is making this action fair-seeming to me and making me think that I am keen to spread the Da`wah and benefit the Muslims by guiding them to correct belief and the sound path. I am convinced that it is not permissible for a non-Mahram man to teach women without a barrier, but isn’t my work necessary, because the secularists, Sufis and others are in control of most fields in our country?","['Praise be to Allah.The prohibition of free mixing between men and women\nOne of the problems with which many Muslims are faced nowadays is the prevalence of free mixing in universities, hospitals , most public facilities and government workplaces.\xa0\nWe have previously explained the prohibition on free mixing and the negative consequences that result from it, in the answer to question no.\xa01200 , where we stated that it is obligatory for the Muslim to avoid studying and working in mixed environments.\xa0\nStudy or teaching in mixed schools\nBut in the countries where the people are faced with the problem of mixing in most fields of life , especially educational centres and workplaces , to the extent that it has become extremely difficult for the Muslim to protect himself from that, a concession is granted to them that is not granted to others whom Allah has protected from such problems.\xa0\nThis concession is based on a principle of Fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) that “whatever is prohibited so as to bar the means that may lead to evil may be permitted in cases of necessity and where doing so serves a greater interest.”\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“All Islamic rulings are based on the principle that some evil which is ordinarily prohibited becomes permissible if there is an urgent need that outweighs."" (Majmu` Al-Fatawa 29/49)\xa0\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) also said:\xa0\n“With regard to that which comes under the heading of barring the means (that lead to something prohibited), it is only to be prohibited if there is no need for it. However, if there is a need for it in order to achieve a purpose that cannot be achieved otherwise, then it is not to be prohibited."" (Majmu` Al-Fatawa\xa0 23/214)\xa0\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“That which is prohibited so as to bar the means (that lead to something prohibited) may be permitted if there is a clear benefit to be achieved, for example: … Nafl prayers that are offered for a specific reason are permissible after Fajr and ‘Asr (when Nafl prayers that are not done for a specific reason are not allowed, until after sunrise and sunset respectively); it is permissible for one who wants to propose for marriage, one who is giving a testimony, a doctor and one who is party to a transaction, buying or selling, to look at a woman’s face in a manner that is ordinarily prohibited; and the prohibition on gold and silk for men is a prohibition that serves to bar the means that may lead to men imitating women, for which the one who does that is cursed, but it is permitted in cases of necessity."" (I`lam Al-Muwaqqi`in\xa0 2/161)\xa0\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“With regard to that which is prohibited in the sense of prohibiting the means (that may lead to something prohibited), it may be permitted in the case of necessity."" (Manthumat Usul Al-Fiqh\xa0 p. 67)\xa0\nWhat appears to be the case, and Allah knows best, is that in such countries where this problem (free mixing) is widespread, a concession may be granted allowing the people to study and work in mixed environments, such as is not granted to others, as stated above.\xa0\nConditions of studying or working in mixed schools\nNonetheless, the following are some conditions that have be met:\xa0\n\nOne should first of all strive hard to look for a place in which there is no mixing, as much as possible.\xa0\n\n\nOne should adhere to the Islamic rulings such as lowering the gaze, and not talking and engaging in conversation more than is necessary for the purpose of work or study.\xa0\n\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about a young man who cannot find anything but a school that is mixed. He said:\xa0\n“You have to look for a school that is not like this, but if you cannot find such a school, and you need to study, then you may read and study, and try to the best of your ability to keep away from immorality and temptation, by lowering your gaze, guarding your tongue, not talking to women and not walking past them."" (Fatawa Nur `Ala Ad-Darb\xa0 1/103, 13/127)\xa0\n\nIf one notices in himself an inclination towards that which is prohibited, and realises that he is being tempted by some of the women who are with him, then preserving his religious commitment takes precedence over all other benefits. In that case, it becomes essential for him to leave that place, and Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, will make him independent of means by His bounty.\xa0\n\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/127946/studying-or-teaching-in-mixed-schools
145770,"I am going to trade in 24-karat gold, but not on a daily basis. For example, I have a gold ingot and if I realise that the price has risen, I will sell it, but if the price drops I will not sell it. If I am waiting for the price to rise again, is it regarded as trade goods? Do the rulings on zakah apply to it, and what is the rate of zakah? Please note that my intention is not to buy and sell gold, except when the price rises.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nZakah is due on gold of all types, if it reaches the nisab (minimum threshold at which zakah becomes due), regardless of whether it is kept for sale or not, unless it is permissible jewellery that is kept to be worn. In that case, there is a difference of scholarly opinion, but the more correct view is that it is subject to zakah, as has been explained previously in the answers to questions no. 19901 and 59866 .\nSecondly:\nThe nisab for pure (24-karat) gold is 85 grams. If someone owns gold of this amount, and one full hijri year has passed since he acquired it, then he must give zakah on it. The amount he must give is one quarter of one tenth (2.5%), to be given from the gold itself, or the value of the gold must be worked out based on today’s price, then the value of the zakah may be given in cash.\nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 64 .\nWe ask Allah the Most Generous to bless us and you and all the Muslims with halal provision, and to guide us all to the truth, for He, may He be glorified, is able to do that.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/145770/zakah-is-obligatory-on-all-types-of-gold
99642,"I borrowed some money in dollars from a friend, and I paid him back in Saudi riyals in installments based on the rate of exchange at that time (the time of the loan). What is the ruling on that?","['Praise be to Allah.Can you pay off a loan in a different currency?\nThe basic principle is that loans should be repaid in the same currency as they were taken by the borrower, unless the two parties agree at the time of repayment to repay it in a different currency.\xa0\nThere is nothing wrong with that, so long as that is done at the rate of exchange on the day of repayment, not the rate of exchange that existed on the day when the loan was given. This applies to every payment; it is permissible for the two parties to agree at the time of repayment that it may be paid in a different currency , at the current rate of exchange.\xa0\nHaram transactions pertaining to paying off a loan in a different currency\nBut you should be aware that there are three haram forms of such transactions:\xa0\n\nWhere the two parties agree at the time of the loan to pay it back in a different currency. This is haram, because in this case the transaction is actually selling the present currency for another currency to be paid at a later date, which is riba al-nasi’ah .\xa0\n\nOne of the conditions of selling one kind of currency for another is that it be done hand to hand, as is indicated by the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Gold for gold, silver for silver, like for like, same for same, hand to hand… but if these commodities differ, then sell as you wish, if it is hand to hand.” (Narrated by Muslim (1578) from ‘Ubadah ibn as-Samit)\xa0\nThe currencies that exist nowadays are based on the value of gold and silver, so they come under the same rulings as them.\xa0\n\nWhere they do not agree to that initially, but they agree on a different currency at the time of repayment and they work it out based on the rate of exchange at the time of the loan. This is also haram, and it is like the form mentioned above.\xa0\n\nThe jurists quoted as evidence that it is haram the well known hadith that was narrated by Ahmad (6239), Abu Dawud (3354), Al-Nasa’i (4582), At-Tirmidhi (1242) and Ibn Majah (2262) from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: I used to sell camels for dinars [i.e., to be paid at a later date] but accept dirhams, and sell them for dirhams but accept dinars. I asked the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about that and he said: “There is nothing wrong with taking it based on the current price, so long as you do not separate with something still outstanding.”\xa0\nThis hadith was classed as sahih by some scholars, such as An-Nawawi and Ahmad Shakir; others classed the words of Ibn ‘Umar, but not the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), as sahih, such as Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar and Al-Albani. (See: Irwa’ al-Ghalil, 5/173)\xa0\nThere is another reason for this prohibition, which is that if you take more than the price on the day of repayment, then you have made a profit on something that is not in your possession, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade making a profit on anything that is not in one’s possession. (Narrated by the authors of Al-Sunan with a sahih isnad)\xa0\n\nWhere they agree at the time of repayment to repay it in a different currency, but they part with something till outstanding. For example, if the loan is one thousand dollars, and they agree when the time comes to pay it back in pounds, let’s say 5000, and he takes 4000 but the borrower still owes 1000. This is not permissible, because when selling one currency for another, it is stipulated that it should be done hand to hand, as stated above.\xa0\n\nAl-Khattabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said, commenting on the hadith of Ibn ‘Umar quoted above: “It is stipulated that they should not part with anything outstanding between them, because paying off dirhams with dinars is an exchange of currency, and a transaction that involves exchanging currencies is not valid unless it is done hand to hand.” (`Awn Al-Ma`bud)\xa0\nBut if the loan is to be paid off in installments, then there is nothing wrong with agreeing to pay each installment at the rate of exchange on the day it is paid. There are no shar’i reservations about that, because it does not involve any delay in exchanging the currency. \xa0\nThere follow some comments of the scholars concerning this issue:\xa0\nThe scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas were asked: I borrowed some money from someone (French currency) on the condition that I would give it back to him in France, but when he came to Algeria he asked me to give him Algerian dirhams with some extra. What is the ruling on that?\xa0\nThey replied:\xa0\n“It is permissible to pay him back in Algeria the same amount in French currency or the equivalent at the current rate of exchange in Algerian currency, so long as it is handed over before you part.” (Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Da’imah, 14/143)\xa0\nThey were also asked (14/144): What is the ruling on borrowing money in one currency then paying the loan back a few months later in a different currency, when the price of the currency may have changed during the period of the loan?\xa0\nThey replied:\n“If a person borrows money without stipulating any interest to be paid, or he repays it in another currency at the rate of exchange at the time of repayment, without stipulating anything that benefits the lender, that is permissible, because that involves cooperation between Muslims and meeting their needs. But if he stipulates that he has to pay interest on this loan or that he has to give it back in a certain currency or offer any benefit to the lender, then it is haram, because it is riba that is forbidden according to the Quran and Sunnah and scholarly consensus.”\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: One of my relatives who lives in Cairo has asked me for a loan of 2500 Egyptian pounds, and I sent him 2000 dollars, which he sold and got 2490 Egyptian pounds. Now he wants to pay back the loan. Please note that we did not agree on a time or method for repayment. My question is: Should I take from him 2490 Egyptian pounds, which is currently worth 1800 US dollars (less than the amount that I gave him in dollars) or should I take 2000 dollars, knowing that this will mean that he has to buy the dollars for approximately 2800 Egyptian pounds (i.e., over 300 pounds more than he actually got)?\xa0\nHe replied:\xa0\n“What he must do is return the dollars that he borrowed from you, because this is the loan that he got from you. But if you agree that he will give you Egyptian pounds, there is nothing wrong with that. Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: We used to sell camels in al-Baqi’ for dirhams and accept dinars for them, and we would sell for dinars and accept dirhams. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is nothing wrong with taking it based on the current price, so long as you do not separate with something still outstanding.” This is selling one currency for another, which is akin to selling gold for silver. If you and he agree that he will repay you for these dollars in Egyptian pounds, so long as you do not take from him more pounds than are dictated by the rate of exchange at the time when you agree to that, there is nothing wrong with it. For example, if 2000 dollars are equivalent to 2800 pounds now, it is not permissible for you to take three thousand pounds from him, but it is permissible for you to take 2800 pounds, and it is permissible for you to take 2000 dollars only, i.e., you should take it at the current price or less, and do not take more because if you take more, you will have made a profit on something that is not in your possession, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade making a profit on anything that is not in one’s possession.. But if you take less, you will have taken some of what you are entitled to, and waived the rest, and there is nothing wrong with that.” (Fatawa Islamiyyah, 2/414)\xa0\nFor, more, please see these answers: 23388 , 12541 , 381582 , 109938 , and 217847 .\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/99642/can-you-pay-off-a-loan-in-a-different-currency
