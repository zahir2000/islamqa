502471,"I started a partnership with a friend of mine, and after six months I wanted to introduce to the market a product that I had already started to develop myself without any contribution from my partner. But that was not very clear, even though in my own mind I thought that he understood from our conversation that I would sell to some of my own exclusive customers [and keep that profit for myself], and we would share the profit on what he sold, because I gave him the product. After one year, when we divided the assets of the company and dissolved the partnership, he asked me to pay him his share of what I had collected of profits. After referring the matter to an imam in our neighbourhood, I give him half of what I had collected from customers. Now there are outstanding debts still owed by customers whose accounts I was in charge of, and I intend to give him half of what they pay back to me. My question is about another type of customers; they are customers who were with me and I will continue to provide services to them. There are also other customers who spoke to me during that year [when the company was operating] but did not buy the product from me until after the partnership had been dissolved. Is he [my former partner] entitled to a share of the income from these customers on the grounds that I got to know them and they got in touch with me during the time of our partnership, or is it income in which he has no share, because we clearly changed the partnership, and those transactions were done after these changes were made to the partnership and it was dissolved?","['Praise be to Allah.Your question is not clear, and you should have explained what you meant by services and how they are connected to the products. If, for example, you sold a product during the lifetime of the company, and that product needs regular maintenance in return for fees, then a deal should have been made when dissolving the partnership to share these customers, or to agree on a specific way of dealing with those who bought these products, because these services are connected to the partnership, so neither partner should keep the customers and exclude the other partner.\nMoreover, if a product was offered to a customer during the lifetime of the company, and that took effort and time, but the sale was done after the dissolution of the partnership, then you must tell your former partner and reach an agreement with him to divide the profits, because the profits resulted from efforts made during the lifetime of the company.\nThis applies so long as the partners did not agree when dissolving the partnership that each partner would deal with whatever calls he received for maintenance, sales and so on, regardless of whether it was a continuation of the partner’s work during the lifetime of the company or not.\nBut generally speaking, if the partnership has ceased, there is nothing wrong with any of the partners dealing with former customers of the company, and there should be no restrictions on him. So no one should be told to end his connection with the customers or to get rid of customers’ phone numbers and the like. The partner has no right to stipulate that when dissolving the partnership.\nThe partner does not have to give away any of his profits to his former partner because he did business with some customers whom he came to know through the company. If it were to be suggested that that should be the case, this means that the partnership should still exist. But in principle partnership is not a permanently binding contract, and it has now been dissolved.\nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 417781 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/502471/doing-business-with-customers-of-the-company-after-the-partnership-has-been-dissolved
511535,How can we reconcile between affirming Allah’s exaltedness and the verse {and the heavens will be rolled up in His Right Hand}?,"['Praise be to Allah.There is no contradiction between affirming the exaltedness of Allah, may He be exalted, and the fact that on the Day of Resurrection He will roll up the heavens in His right hand, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{They have not given due recognition to Allah. On the Day of Resurrection, the entire earth will be in His grip, and the heavens will be rolled up in His Right Hand. Glorified and exalted be Allah far above the partners they ascribe to Him!}\xa0[az-Zumar 39:67].\nThat is because exaltedness means that Allah, may He be exalted, is above all things, above the heavens, above the Throne and above everything that is created. He is exalted in the sense of controlling and subduing, and exalted in His Essence (in a true sense). Thus He is the Exalted, the Most High, as is stated in His Book and by His Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and as was unanimously agreed upon by the early generations of the ummah.\nWhat is narrated in the texts about Allah being “in heaven” – such as the verse (interpretation of the meaning): {Do you feel secure that He who is in heaven would not cause the earth to swallow you and suddenly it would begin to shake?} [al-Mulk 67:16];\nThe hadith narrated from Abu Sa‘eed al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Do you not trust me, when I am the trustee of the One Who is in heaven”;\nThe hadith narrated by Muslim (537) from Mu‘awiyah ibn al-Hakam as-Sulami about his striking his slave woman. He said: I came to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and he regarded that as a grievous action on my part. I said: O Messenger of Allah, should I set her free? He said: “Bring her to me.” So I brought her to him and he said to her: “Where is Allah?” She said: In heaven. He said: “Who am I?” She said: You are the Messenger of Allah. He said: “Set her free, for she is a believer.”\nWhat is meant by fi’s-sama’ (translated here as “in heaven”) is exaltedness, because anything that is high above may be called sama’ in Arabic.\nOr it may mean above the heaven, because prepositions in Arabic may be used interchangeably, as in the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): {and I will crucify you on [fi – lit. “in”] the trunks of palm trees} [Ta-Ha 20:71] and {So travel freely, [O disbelievers], throughout [fi – lit. “in”] \xa0the land} [at-Tawbah 9:2], meaning on the land.\nNone of Ahl as-Sunnah suggest that Allah is inside the seven heavens, or that anything of His creation encompasses Him; exalted be Allah far above that.\nAbu’l-Hasan al-Ash‘ari says in his letter to the people on the border (Risalah ila Ahl ath-Thaghr, p. 130), regarding what was agreed upon by Ahl as-Sunnah: That Allah, may He be exalted, is above His heavens, above His throne. This is indicated by the verses (interpretation of the meaning): {Do you feel secure that He who is in heaven would not cause the earth to swallow you and suddenly it would begin to shake?} [al-Mulk 67:16] and {To Him ascend all good words, and righteous deeds exalt them} [Fatir 35:10].\nAnd Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): {The Most Gracious rose over the Throne [in a manner that befits His Majesty]} [Ta-Ha 20:5]. His rising over the Throne does not mean that He has control of it, as the Qadaris said, because He, may He be glorified and exalted, has always been above all things. End quote.\nAl-Bayhaqi said in al-I‘tiqad (p. 112): Chapter regarding Allah’s rising above the Throne. Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {The Most Gracious rose over the Throne [in a manner that befits His Majesty]} [Ta-Ha 20:5].\nThe Throne is the well-known seat that is known to people of reason. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says elsewhere (interpretation of the meaning): {and His Throne had been upon water} [Hud 11:7]… and {They fear their Lord above them, and they do what they are commanded} [an-Nahl 16:50], and {To Him ascend all good words, and righteous deeds exalt them} [Fatir 35:10] and {Do you feel secure that He who is in heaven would not cause the earth to swallow you and suddenly it would begin to shake?} [al-Mulk 67:16].\nWhat is meant is the One Who is above the heavens, as Allah says elsewhere: {and I will crucify you on [fi – lit. “in”] the trunks of palm trees} [Ta-Ha 20:71] and {So travel freely, [O disbelievers], throughout [fi – lit. “in”]\xa0 \xa0the land} [at-Tawbah 9:2], meaning on the land.\nEverything that is up above may be called sama’ in Arabic, and the Throne is above the highest heavens.\nWhat the verse means – and Allah knows best – is: Do you feel secure that He Who is on the Throne [will not cause the earth to swallow you up…], as is clearly stated in other verses. End quote.\nAl-Hafiz ibn ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said: As for the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {Do you feel secure that He who is in heaven would not cause the earth to swallow you and suddenly it would begin to shake?} [al-Mulk 67:16], what it means is: the One Who is above the heavens, meaning above the Throne.\nThe Arabic preposition fi (“in”) may mean ‘ala (“above”) as in the verses: and {So travel freely, [O disbelievers], throughout [fi – lit. “in”]\xa0 the land} [at-Tawbah 9:2], meaning on the land, and {and I will crucify you on [fi – lit. “in”] the trunks of palm trees} [Ta-Ha 20:71].""(At-Tamhid\xa0 7/130).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The scholars said: In response, we may adopt one of two interpretations:\n1. Either we may understand as-sama’ as referring to what is up above, and as-sama’ in the sense of what is up above is well known in Arabic, and indeed, in the Qur’an. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {He sends down water from the heaven [as-sama’] and the watercourses flow} [ar-Ra‘d 13:17]; what is meant by as-sama’ [translated here as heaven] is what is up above, because the water comes down from the clouds, not from as-sama’, which is the canopy of heaven, whereas the cloud is up high, between heaven and earth, as Allah, may He be exalted, says elsewhere (interpretation of the meaning): {and the clouds controlled between the heaven and the earth} [al-Baqarah 2:164].\nSo what is meant by the One Who is in heaven is the One Who is up above.\nThere is no problem after that, for Allah is up above; there is nothing at the same level as Him and nothing above Him.\n2.. Or we may understand the preposition fi (“in”) as meaning ‘ala (“above”), and regard as-sama’ as being the canopy of heaven raised high, referring to the heavenly bodies, as the preposition fi (“in”) may mean ‘ala (“above”) in Arabic. In fact, in the Qur’an, Pharaoh says to his people, the magicians who believed: {and I will crucify you on [fi – lit. “in”] the trunks of palm trees} [Ta-Ha 20:71].\nThus the meaning of the One Who is in the heaven is the One Who is above the heaven.""(Sharh al-Wasitiyyah\xa0 1/398).\nOnce this is clear, it is the same whether the heavens are there or Allah, may He be glorified, has rolled up the heavens in His Right Hand, for He is above all things, and He has no need of the heavens or the Throne.\nAt-Tahawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his ‘Aqidah (p. 54): The Throne and the Footstool are real, and Allah has no need of the Throne nor anything beneath it; He encompasses and is above all things. End quote.\nConclusion:\nThe confusion about the apparent contradiction is only caused by thinking that Allah, may He be exalted, is in the heavens or that He needs the heavens to be exalted.\nHe, may He be glorified, is far above both, for nothing encompasses Him and He has no need of anything, may He be blessed, exalted and sanctified.\nYou should understand that there is no alternative to believing that He is exalted, except two views which are both false: the view that Allah is present everywhere, as the Jahamis said, and the view that Allah is neither inside the universe not outside it, as the Ash‘aris said.\nAdh-Dhahabi (may Allah have mercy on him) concluded his book al-‘Uluw li’l-‘Ali al-Ghaffar by saying:\nAllah is above His Throne, as the early generations were agreed on and the leading scholars narrated it from them. They said that in refutation of the Jahamis, who said that Allah is everywhere, and quoted as evidence the verse (interpretation of the meaning): {and He is with you} [al-Hadid 57:4].\nThese two views are those that existed at the time of the Tabi‘in and succeeding generations and they are reasonable views in general.\nAs for the third view which developed recently – which says that Allah, may He be exalted, is nowhere; He is not outside anything or above His Throne; He is not connected to His creation or separate from them; His holy Essence is not separate from His creation; He is not in any direction and is not outside the directions; and He is not this and not that, and so on – this is something that makes no sense and is incomprehensible, in addition to being contrary to the religious texts.\nSo flee for the sake of your faith and beware of the views of ahl al-kalam. Believe in Allah and what came from Allah, as Allah intended it, and delegate your affairs to Allah, for there is no power and no strength except with Allah.""(Al-‘Uluw, p. 267).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/511535/how-can-we-reconcile-between-affirming-allahs-exaltedness-and-the-verse-and-the-heavens-will-be-rolled-up-in-his-right-hand
21616,"If I miss a prayer for a reason such as sleeping, should I pray the prayer I have missed or the present prayer, if the present prayer has already been prayed in congregation?","['Praise be to Allah.Importance of offering prayer on time\nThe Muslim should maintain the habit of praying regularly on time , for Allah praises the believers who, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And those who guard their Salah (prayers) well.” [Al-Ma’arij 70:34]\nMaking missed up prayer\xa0\nIf a person has an excuse and he missed a prayer, then he has to make it up , because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever forgets a prayer or sleeps and misses it , the expiation for this sin is to pray it when he remembers it.” (Narrated by Muslim, Al-Masajid wa Mawadi` Al-Salah, 1103)\nShould one pray the missed prayer first?\nIf you miss a prayer , then you have to pray that prayer first, then pray the current prayer; it is not permissible to delay (making up the missed prayer). It is commonly thought among the people that if a man misses an obligatory prayer, he should make it up with the corresponding obligatory prayer of the next day, so that if, for example, he missed Fajr on one day he can only pray it with Fajr on the second day. This is wrong, and it goes against the teaching of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), in both his words and deeds.\nIt was narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever forgets a prayer or sleeps and misses it, then let him pray it when he remembers it.” He did not say, let him pray it on the following day when the time for that prayer comes, rather he said, “let him pray it when he remembers it.”\xa0\nWith regard to the Prophet’s actions, when he missed a prayer on one of the days of the campaign of Al-Khandaq, he prayed it before the current prayer , which indicates that one has to pray the missed prayer and then pray the current prayer. But if he forgets and prays the current prayer before the missed prayer, or he was ignorant and did not know (of the ruling), then he prayer is valid because he has an excuse. (See Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin, vol. 12, p. 222)\nThe hadith about the prayer on the day of Al-Khandaq was narrated by An-Nasa’i from ‘Abd Ar-Rahman ibn Abu Sa`id from his father, who said: “The disbelievers kept us busy on the day of Al-Khandaq and distracted us from praying Dhuhr until the sun set. Then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded Bilal to call the Iqamah for Dhuhr prayer, and he prayed it, then he called the Iqamah for Asr and he prayed it, then he called the Adhan for Maghrib then he prayed it as he usually prayed it, on time.” (Al-Adhan, 655; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih An-Nasa’i, no. 638)\nMaking up missed prayers: In what order?\nThe action of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) indicates that it is obligatory to pray the missed prayers in the right order . But if there is only enough time left to pray the current prayer, then he should pray the current prayer, then pray the ones that came before it.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21616/should-one-pray-the-missed-prayer-first
