503221,What is the ruling on believing that the divine attributes – such as the Quran or other divine attributes – could benefit or harm?,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nDivine attributes that are isolated [in a person’s mind] from the divine Essence can neither bring benefit nor cause harm. Whoever believes that they can bring benefit or cause harm in and of themselves has gone against Islamic teachings and reason.\nWe have previously explained that in the case of a divine attribute that is isolated [in a person’s mind] from the divine Essence, we cannot call upon that attribute on its own, or seek refuge with it. Calling upon the attribute in isolation [of the divine Essence] constitutes shirk, according to the consensus of the Muslims.\nSecondly:\nThe attributes of Allah, may He be exalted, are part of His Essence and cannot be separated from it. Hence the one who seeks refuge in the might of Allah, may He be exalted, or in His words has sought refuge with Allah, Who possesses the attributes of might and speech. So there is a difference between calling upon the attribute and calling upon Allah by virtue of the attribute, and between seeking refuge with the attribute and seeking refuge with the One Who possesses this attribute.\nIf someone says: However, since the Quran benefits the one who reads it and will intercede for its companions, this is true and is proven in the religious texts. But that is not because the attribute can bring benefit by itself; rather it is because Allah, may He be exalted, has put benefit and blessing in His words. Therefore the one who reads His words will be rewarded, and the one who seeks healing from them will be healed, and so on, and that has been proven, such as the fact that the Quran will come on the Day of Resurrection to intercede for its companions.\nSo the Quran may bring benefit in two ways: because it is the word of Allah, and the benefit comes from Allah, Who uttered it; or because the Quran is a means which Allah has made to be beneficial, so the benefit in its entirety is from Him, may He be blessed and exalted.\nThe Quran is the word of Allah and is not created. In other words, Allah, may He be exalted, uttered it, so it is one of His attributes. But people may assume things that are not possible, and think that the words are something separate that Allah did not say. In that case, whoever believes that the words on their own may bring benefit or cause harm by themselves has disbelieved. He has said something that is impossible, because the attribute can only exist in the one to whom it is ascribed. There is no such thing as words that exist by themselves; rather they are the words of Allah or the words of Zayd or ‘Amr. There is no such thing as knowledge that stands by itself or mercy that stands by itself; rather the attributes exist in the one to whom they are ascribed.\nShaykh ‘Abd ar-Rahman al-Barrak (may Allah preserve him) said: Calling upon the attribute is not mentioned in the supplications that are narrated in the religious texts, and that cannot be something that is prescribed or permissible, because calling upon the attribute – such as saying “O mercy of Allah, O might of ALlah, O power of Allah” – implies that the attribute is something separate and independent of Allah, and that it can hear and respond. Whoever believes that is a disbeliever. Rather the attributes of Allah exist in Him, and none of them is a god that can be called upon. In fact, Allah with His attributes, is one God, and He is the one to be called upon and the one in Whom we should put our trust; He is the only one to be worshipped, and there is no god worthy of worship except Him.

219227,"The iqamah for `Asr prayer was given after I had finished the second circuit of Tawaf when I did `umrah, so I prayed `Asr, then after praying I was not able to continue Tawaf because of the crowds, so I left with my family, and I came back the next day and did seven circuits of Tawaf around the Ka`bah to replace the five circuits of Tawaf from the previous day.","['Praise be to Allah.Is doing the Tawaf\xa0 circuits consecutively Essential?\nDoing the Tawaf\xa0 circuits consecutively is a condition of it being valid, according to the most correct scholarly view. However, a brief interruption between them does not matter.\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“One of the conditions of Tawaf being valid is continuity between its circuits.” (Al-Liqa’ Ash-Shahri, 3/205)\xa0\nInterruption of Tawaaf for Prayer\nIf the Iqamah for prayer is given when you are doing Tawaf , then you should pray, then complete Tawaf from where you left off in order to pray.\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“If the Iqamah for prayer is given whilst you are doing Tawaf , whether it is Tawaf for `Umrah or for Hajj or a voluntary Tawaf, then you should interrupt your Tawaf and pray, then go back and complete your Tawaf. You do not have to start all over again; rather you may complete your Tawaf from where you left off, and there is no need to start the circuit over again, because what you did previously was based on a sound foundation, and it is allowed to interrupt it for the prayer, so it cannot be invalid.” (Fatawa Nur `ala Ad-Darb, 12/2)\xa0\nShaykh Salih Al-Fawzan (may Allah preserve him) said:\xa0\n“One of the conditions of Tawaf being valid is that there should be continuity between the circuits, and one should also persist in doing a single circuit until it is complete. However it is permissible, when there is a valid excuse, interrupting that continuity , such as if the Iqamah for prayer is given when a person is doing Tawaf. In that case he should pray, then when he has said the Taslim, he should do the remaining circuits of Tawaf, carrying on from where he left off. The same applies if he feels tired during a circuit, and he rests briefly, then continues. There is nothing wrong with that, in sha Allah, because it is for a valid reason. But if he interrupts that continuity when there is no need to do so – for example, if there is a lengthy interruption between circuits – then in that case it is essential to start Tawaf all over again, because he did not fulfill the condition of continuity between circuits , with no valid reason.” (Al-Muntaqa min Fatawa Al-Fawzan, 67/1)\xa0\nBased on the above, what you did of repeating Tawaf in full, with seven circuits, on the second day, was the right thing to do and was what was required of you, because you did not complete the first Tawaf within a reasonable time, and you left a lengthy interruption between the two Tawafs. So it would not have been correct to try to complete the first one by basing the circuits on the second day on it.\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\xa0\nA man did two circuits of Tawaf, but because of the crowds he came out of Tawaf and rested for an hour or two, then he went back to do Tawaf again. Should he start all over again or complete his Tawaf from where he left off?\xa0\nHe replied:\n“If the interruption was lengthy, such as one or two hours, then what he must do is repeat his Tawaf. But if the interruption was brief, it does not matter. That is because with regard to Tawaf and Sa`i, it is essential that there be continuity, which means doing the circuits (or laps) one after another. If there is a lengthy interruption between circuits, then the first circuits are rendered invalid, and he has to start Tawaf all over again. But if the interruption is not lengthy, such as if he sits down for two or three minutes, then gets up and completes it, that does not matter.” (Majmu` Fatawa wa Rasa’il Al-`Uthaymin, 22/293)\xa0\nRecommended books on Hajj and `Umrah\nSome useful books that explain the rulings on Hajj and `Umrah are the following:\xa0\n\nAt-Tahqiq wal-Idah li Kathir min Masa’il Al-Hajj wal-`Umrah waz-Ziyarah by Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him)\nManasik Al-Hajj wal-`Umrah by Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him)\nAl-Minhaj fi Yawmiyat Al-Hajj by Shaykh `Abdullah ibn Jibrin (may Allah have mercy on him)\nAwdah Al-Masalik ila Ahkam Al-Manasik by Shaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn Muhammad As-Salman (may Allah have mercy on him)\nTabsir An-Nasik bi Ahkam Al-Manasik by Shaykh `Abd Al-Muhsin Al-`Abbad\xa0\n\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/219227/is-doing-the-tawaf-circuits-consecutively-essential
391100,"There is a poor man who asks for charity for himself, but he does it in an indirect manner, because he feels embarrassed about that, so he says: I know someone who needs charity. So people give to him, then he keeps it for himself, and by doing that he maintains his dignity in front of people. What is the ruling on that?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nRuling on asking people for money\nThe basic principle is that it is prohibited to ask of people, unless that is in exceptional circumstances.\nAl-Bukhari (1475) and Muslim (1040) narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “A man will keep on begging from people until he comes on the Day of Resurrection with not a bit of flesh on his face.”\nAl-Bukhari (650), Abu Dawud (1626), an-Nasa’i (2592) and Ibn Majah (1840) narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever begs from people when he has enough to suffice him,\xa0 will come on the Day of Resurrection with his begging like scratches or gashes on his face.” It was said: O Messenger of Allah, what is sufficient for him? He said, “Fifty dirhams, or their value in gold.”\nIt is not permissible to ask of people except in very few [?] circumstances, because of the report narrated by Muslim (1044) from Qabisah ibn Mukhariq al-Hilali, who said: I incurred a debt (in order to reconcile between two parties) and I came to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to ask him (for help) with it. He said: “Stay with us until the zakah comes, and we will order that something be given to you.” Then he said: “O Qabisah, asking for help is not permissible except in one of three cases: a man who has incurred a debt (in order to reconcile between two parties), for whom it is permissible to ask for help until he has paid it off, then he should refrain; a man who has been stricken by a blight that has destroyed all his crops and wealth, for whom it is permissible to ask for help until he has enough to get by – or he gets enough to meet his basic needs; and a man who is stricken by poverty and three men of wisdom among his people acknowledge that So and so has been stricken by poverty, then it becomes permissible for him to ask for help until he has enough to get by – or to meet his basic needs. Apart from these cases asking for help, O Qabisah, is haram and the one who collects it is consuming something haram.”\nIt says in Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah (24/375): It is permissible to ask people for money for a needy person who does not have enough to suffice him, and is not able to earn money. He may ask people for enough to meet his need only.\nAs for one who is not in need, or one who is in need but is able to earn money, it is not permissible for him to ask of people, and whatever he takes from people in this case is haram for him, because of the hadith of Qabisah… End quote.\nSo this brother should think about whether it is permissible for him to ask of people or not.\nSecondly:\nOne who is appointed to distribute charity and decides to take some of it for himself if he is poor\nThe jurists differed concerning someone who is appointed to distribute charity or zakah: does he have the right to take some of it for himself if he is poor?\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If he is appointed to give out charity to the needy and he is needy, or he is instructed to distribute one third of it to some people and he is one of them, or he is given money and is instructed to distribute it to whomever he wants or to give it to whomever he wants, then what is narrated from Ahmad is that it is not permissible for him to take any of it. Ahmad said: If he has in his possession money to be given to the poor and spent on charitable causes and he is in need, he should not consume any of it, because he was only instructed to distribute it. That is because the general meaning of the instructions given by the one who appointed him indicates that it should be given to others.""(Al-Mughni\xa0 5/70).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin was asked about a poor man who takes zakah from his rich friend on the grounds that he will distribute it, then he keeps it himself. What is the ruling on doing that?\nHe replied: This is haram for him, because it is betraying the trust. His friend gave it to him on the basis that he would act as his proxy and give it to others, but he is taking it for himself. The scholars stated that it is not permissible for a proxy to give to himself that which he has been appointed to distribute.\nBased on that, what this person must do is explain to his friend that what he used to take before was spent on himself. If he pardons him, all well and good, but if he does not pardon him, then he is liable, meaning that he is liable for what he kept for himself and must give that amount as zakah on behalf of his friend.""(Fatawa Arkan al-Islam\xa0 p. 447).\nThis applies to one who is given money to distribute without asking for that, so how about if he asks for it and pretends that it is for others?\nIf he is given money to distribute without asking for it, it may be that he is included in what the giver said, “Give it to the poor.” But if he asked for it and said: “There is a poor person who is in need of money,” in that case what would come to the giver’s mind is that it was for someone else, so he is not included in what he said to the giver and his taking anything of that money is a betrayal of the trust, as noted above in the words of Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him). Opening this door will result in a great deal of trouble and betrayal, and will lead to carelessness regarding the matter of devouring people’s wealth unlawfully.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/391100/ruling-on-one-who-asks-for-charity-for-someone-else-then-keeps-it-for-himself-because-he-is-poor
108955,What is the prescribed punishment for slander?,"['Praise be to Allah.What is slander?\nWhat is meant by slander with regard to the prescribed punishment is an accusation of zina (adultery or fornication) or homosexuality . The one who accuses a person of zina or vilifies him in such terms has slandered him and accused him of something abhorrent.\xa0\nSlander is prohibited , and is indeed a major sin, if the person slandered is chaste and innocent of zina.\xa0\nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Verily, those who accuse chaste women, who never even think of anything touching their chastity and are good believers — are cursed in this life and in the Hereafter, and for them will be a great torment.” [An-Nur 24:23]\xa0\nAs-Sa`di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Allah has issued a stern warning against making accusations against chaste women, as He says: “Verily, those who accuse chaste women”, i.e., those who refrain from immoral actions, “who never even think of anything touching their chastity”, and such things would never cross their minds, “and are good believers — are cursed in this life and in the Hereafter”, and a curse applies only in the case of major sins.\xa0\nThe curse is confirmed because it is ongoing in this world and in the Hereafter. “and for them will be a great torment”. This is in addition to the curse, and shows that they are even further removed from divine mercy, and that His severe punishment will be upon them.”\xa0\nAnd the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Avoid the seven sins that doom a person to Hell.” It was said: What are they, O Messenger of Allah? He said: “Associating others with Allah (shirk); witchcraft; killing a soul whom Allah has forbidden us to kill, except in cases dictated by Islamic law; consuming orphans’ wealth; consuming riba; fleeing from the battlefield; and slandering chaste, innocent women.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari (2767) and Muslim (89)\xa0\nAl-Hafidh Ibn Hajar said: “What is meant by the sins that doom a person to Hell are major sins.”\xa0\nIt says in Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah (22/76):\xa0\n“It is not permissible for a Muslim to slander his brother, and it is a major sin; he must repent from that and seek forgiveness from the one whom he slandered; if the latter does not pardon him, he has the right to demand his rights according to Shari`ah.\xa0\nAnd Allah is the Source of strength. May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.”\xa0\nShaykh `Abd al-`Aziz ibn `Abdullah ibn Baz, Shaykh `Abd Ar-Razzaq `Afifi, Shaykh `Abdullah ibn Ghadyan\xa0\nPunishment for slander in Islam\nThe scholars unanimously agreed that it is obligatory to carry out the prescribed punishment on one who slanders a chaste person, and the punishment is eighty lashes, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And those who accuse chaste women, and produce not four witnesses, flog them with eighty stripes, and reject their testimony forever. They indeed are the Fasiqun (liars, rebellious, disobedient to Allah).” [An-Nur 24:4]\nThe wisdom behind the prescribed punishment for slander\xa0\n\nIt prevents accusations of immorality.\nIt protects people’s honour from being transgressed and protects their reputations from being tarnished.\nIt prevents enmity and grudges; wars may break out because of slurs against people’s honour.\nIt prevents such things becoming part of public opinion and protects people from having to hear them\nIt prevents the spread of rumours among the believers, because when there are a lot of accusations and such talk becomes common and is easily spoken of, the foolish become bold enough to commit such actions.\n\nSo it is wise to prescribe the prescribed punishment for slander so that people will refrain from accusing one another of immoral actions.
