507192,"Is it permissible for a university student to use the AI app ChatGPT to help in writing program code that has to do with university assignments, as a type of research and learning? Is it regarded as being like using the search engine Google when it is used for the purpose of research?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThere is nothing wrong with using AI for beneficial and useful purposes, because the basic principle is that useful things are permissible, as Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{It is He who created for you all of that which is on the earth} [Al-Baqarah 2:29]\n{Say, “Who has forbidden the adornment of Allah which He has produced for His servants and the good [lawful] things of provision?” Say, “They are for those who believe during the worldly life [but] exclusively for them on the Day of Resurrection”} [Al-A`raf 7:32].\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: One of the principles affirmed by the scholars is that useful things are permissible and are allowed, except those for which there is proof that they are prohibited. This principle is based on the texts of the Qur’an and Sunnah.\nIn the Quran, Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{It is He who created for you all of that which is on the earth} [Al-Baqarah 2:29].\nIn the Sunnah, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah, may He be exalted, has enjoined obligatory duties, so do not neglect them. He has set limits, so do not transgress them. He has said nothing about some things out of mercy towards you, not out of forgetfulness, so do not enquire about them.” And he said: “Whatever He said nothing about is overlooked.” (End quote from Majmu` Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 12/169)\nSecondly:\nWith regard to using AI to write program codes having to do with university assignments, what appears to be the case is that it is not permissible, because the aim of the assignments is to train the student, measure his ability and make sure that he has revised and studied the subject material, and relying on AI to do these assignments will undermine all these objectives. It is like taking the codes from a classmate, which means that the student will put very little effort into the assignment, so it is more akin to cheating than to researching on Google and the like. If someone looks on Google and takes an already-written assignment, that is cheating, because he has put little effort into it himself, and this is the same. If you are uncertain and have some doubts, you should ask the teacher whether it is allowed to do the assignment using AI or not.\nFor more information on the dangers that AI poses to university education, please see: Adh-Dhaka’ Al-Istina`i Fursah lit-Ta`lim Al-Jami`i Aw Khatar ‘Alayhi?\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/507192/what-is-the-ruling-on-using-ai-to-write-school-assignments
125425,Does a man have to cover his shoulders whilst praying? Is praying with bare shoulders permissible or prohibited?,"['Praise be to Allah.Is it obligatory to cover the `Awrah in prayer?\nThe jurists unanimously agreed that it is obligatory to cover the `Awrah whilst praying . The man’s `Awrah is between the navel and the knee, and some of them include the navel and the knee in the `Awrah.\xa0\nIs covering the shoulders in prayer obligatory?\nThey differed as to whether it is obligatory to cover the shoulder, which is the area between the shoulder blade and the neck. The majority are of the view that it is not obligatory , but the Hanbalis are of the view that it is mandatory in obligatory prayers in particular, and that the prayer is not valid otherwise.\xa0\nThe majority quoted as evidence the Hadith narrated by Al-Bukhari (361) and Muslim (3010) from Sa`id ibn Al-Harith who said: We asked Jabir ibn `Abdullah about praying in a single garment and he said: I went out with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) on one of his journeys and I came at night for some purpose, and I found him praying and I was wearing a single garment. I wrapped myself in it and prayed beside him. When he had finished he said: “What is this walking at night O Jabir?” I told him of my need, and when I had finished he said: “What is this wrapping that I see?” I said: It is too small. He said: “If it is large enough, wrap it around the body, and if it is too small, tie it around your waist.”\xa0\nWhen he asked him about walking at night, he was asking him why he had come at this time.\xa0\nThe Hanbalis quoted as evidence the Hadith narrated by Al-Bukhari (359) and Muslim (516) from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No one of you should pray in a single garment with nothing on his shoulders.”\nThe majority of scholars interpreted this as meaning it is recommended, so as to reconcile between the reports.\xa0\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Sharh Muslim: With regard to the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “No one of you should pray in a single garment with nothing on his shoulders”, the scholars said: The reason behind it is that if he wraps it around his waist and no part of it is on his shoulders, there is no guarantee that his `Awrah will not become uncovered , unlike if he places part of it over his shoulder. And because he may need to hold it with his hand or both hands so he will be distracted by that, and will miss out on the Sunnah of placing the right hand over the left hand beneath his chest, and raising the hands when it is Sunnah to do so, and so on. And because he is not covering the upper body which is the place of adornment. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): {Take your adornment (by wearing your clean clothes)} [Al-A`raf 7:31].\nMoreover Malik, Abu Hanifah, and Ash-Shafi`i (may Allah have mercy on them) and the majority of scholars said that this is a prohibition in the sense of being disliked, and it is not prohibited. So if a man prays in a single garment that covers his `Awrah, but no part of it is on his shoulder, then his prayer is valid although it is makrooh, whether he was able to put something on his shoulder or not.\xa0\nAhmad and some of the Salaf (may Allah have mercy on them) said: If he was able to put something over his shoulder, his prayer is not valid unless he covers his shoulder, because of the apparent meaning of the Hadith. And another report was narrated from Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) stating that his prayer is valid, but he is sinning by not doing that.\xa0\nThe evidence of the majority is the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in the Hadith of Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him): “If it is big enough, wrap it around the body, and if it is too small, tie it around your waist.” This was narrated by Al-Bukhari, and by Muslim at the end of the book in his lengthy Hadith. (End quote)\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said, in the commentary on Sharh Zad Al-Mustaqni`: Differentiating between obligatory and optional prayers is contrary to the apparent meaning of the Hadith. Moreover, the author said: “with one of his shoulders” but the Hadith indicates that both shoulders must be covered. What the author said is the well-known view of the Madhhab.\xa0\nThe second opinion is that covering the shoulders is Sunnah and not obligatory, and there is no difference between obligatory and optional prayers, because of the Hadith, “if it is too small, tie it around your waist”. This view is the more correct one, and it is the view of the majority. The idea that there should be something on the shoulders is not because the shoulders are `Awrah , rather it is so that the clothing may be complete and the waist wrapper be tied properly, because if it is not secured at the shoulders, it may come loose and fall. In this case the covering of the shoulders is sought for another purpose; it is not sought in and of itself. (End quote from Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti`, 2/168).\xa0\nAlso please see Al-Mughni (1/338) and Al-Majmu` (3/180)\xa0\nTo sum up, it is not obligatory for a man to cover his shoulders or shoulder blades when praying, but it is recommended to do so as an adornment and out of respect for the prayer and the fact that he is standing before his Lord, may He be Glorified and Exalted; but if he prays with his shoulders or shoulder blade bare, his prayer is valid.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/125425/can-you-pray-with-your-shoulders-exposed
152888,"Is it permissible to offer the funeral prayer for the deceased individually, meaning that one person offers the funeral prayer for him, then someone else comes and offers the funeral prayer for him, and so on, or is that not permissible?","['Praise be to Allah.The Sunnah is to offer the funeral prayer for the deceased in congregation, because that is what the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his Companions did, and that is what the people continued to do. But if they offer the funeral prayer individually, that is permissible.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is permissible to offer the funeral prayer individually, but the Sunnah is to offer this prayer in congregation, because of the hadith: “There is no one who dies and three rows of Muslims offer the funeral prayer for him, but (Paradise) is his due.” There are other well-known authentic hadiths regarding that, in addition to the consensus of the Muslims. The greater the number of the congregation, the better it will be… (End quote from Sharh Al-Muhadhdhab, 5/171).\nIt says in Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah (16/18): … The Hanafis, Shafa`is and Hanbalis stated that praying in congregation is not a condition for the funeral prayer to be valid; rather it is Sunnah… (End quote)\nThe Malikis said: One of the conditions of it [the funeral prayer] being valid is that it should be offered in congregation, like Jumu`ah prayer. If the funeral prayer is offered without an imam, the prayer should be repeated, unless it is too late.

(End quote)\nIbn ‘Abd Al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said: With regard to the people offering the funeral prayer for the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) individually, what is agreed upon by the biographers and a number of hadith scholars is that they did not differ regarding that.

The games take some time for me to obtain money. What is the ruling on this money? Is there anything wrong with giving charity from it or buying food or anything else? Is it permissible or prohibited? Is there any verse in the Holy Quran which forbids that, or any hadith of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)?","['Praise be to Allah.The Islamic Stance on Prize Money in Competitions\nIt is not permissible to offer prizes for any kind of games or contests except in archery and racing on horses and camels, and anything that would come under the same heading as that of things that help in Jihad and supporting it.\nThe basic principle regarding that is the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “There should be no (money) prizes for competitions except in archery , camel-racing and horse-racing.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 1700 and Abu Dawud, 2574. Classed as authentic by Al-Albani.)\nSome scholars added to that anything that helps in Jihad and supports it, such as competitions in memorising the Glorious Quran and the Prophetic Sunnah, and contests involving aeroplanes, ships, boats and the like.\nAl-Khattabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nGiving prizes is not appropriate except in horse and camel races, and similar contests, and in archery contests. That is because these matters are preparation for fighting the enemy, and offering prizes for them encourages people to prepare for Jihad.\nAs for contests in matters that do not come under the heading of preparing for war or strengthening oneself for Jihad, accepting prize money for them is prohibited and is not permissible."" (Ma`alim As-Sunan, 2/255)\nThe Prohibition of Gambling in All Forms\nIf the prize money comes from both competitors then it is gambling, which is prohibited.\nIf the prize money is given by a third person, or by one of them and not the other, then it is prohibited, even if it is not called gambling .\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Rather it is gambling if it is stipulated that money be paid by one of the two parties. But if one of them is offering to give money (to his opponent) if he is defeated, and will keep it if he defeats him, then it is not gambling, but it is an agreement to a contest that does not involve fighting skills, so it is not right."" (Rawdat At-Talibin, 11/225)\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If one of the two players, or an outsider, gives the prize, it is forbidden nevertheless, except in the case of something that is beneficial such as races or archery, as it says in the Hadith: “There should be no (money) prizes for competitions except in archery, camel-racing and horse-racing ”, because spending money on things that are of no benefit in either religious or worldly terms is not allowed, even if it is not gambling.""
