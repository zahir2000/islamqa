249339,"You have a verdict stating that it is permissible to use vanilla which contains alcohol. This ruling has made people in Britain think that one can use food which contains alcohol or wine, on the basis that they evaporate after cooking the food, as stated in your verdict. We hope that you can discuss this verdict again, because it has led to confusion among many women here, and they have begun to buy all those types of foods – there is no power and no strength except with Allah. There are some who say that if it is permissible to buy such foods, then adding alcohol to food when cooking it is also permissible. By Allah, this is a serious problem, so – please – I urge you to discuss the issue again, because the sisters took the verdict from your website.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nAlcohol is an intoxicant and subject to the same rulings as wine, so it is not permissible to deliberately add it to food, medicine, or anything else.\nBut if it has already been added to something, then the sin is on the one who added it.\nThen we should try to find out about the amount of alcohol in the food or medicine. If the amount of alcohol in it is so small that it is absorbed into the food, so that no trace of it remains and the one who eats or drinks a lot of this food or medicine will not become intoxicated, then there is nothing wrong with consuming it.\nThis is contrary to the case where the traces of alcohol or wine remain discernible, such as some types of chocolate, for example, to which some alcohol has been added. In this case, it is not permissible to sell, buy or consume such foods.\nWhat we said about vanilla is not excluded from that. We did not say that it is permissible to use alcohol in it; rather we said that it is permissible to consume it if no trace of alcohol is discernible in it.\nIt says in Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah (22/123): The way in which vinegar is made in Egypt involves using nabeedh or beer, which are then put in sawdust and another substance is added to it until the nabeedh ferments and gives us Egyptian vinegar, as is explained in the science curriculum for students in the third year of preparatory school. What is the ruling on consuming this vinegar?\nAnswer: It is not permissible to add anything that could cause intoxication to something that is intended to be used as medicine, food or drink, or in anything that is intended to be used to make food, drink or condiments, whether that intoxicating substance is nabeedh, beer or anything else.\nA fatwa was issued by the Permanent Committee stating the ruling on mixing medicine with alcohol, and the ruling on consuming it. The fatwa stated: It is not permissible to mix medicines with alcohol that causes intoxication.\nBut if it is already mixed with alcohol, it is permissible to use it if the amount of alcohol is very small and no trace of it is discernible in the colour, taste or smell of the medicine, and drinking it does not cause intoxication. Otherwise, it is prohibited to use that with which alcohol has been mixed.\n‘Abdullah ibn Qa‘ud, ‘Abdullah ibn Ghadyan, ‘Abd ar-Razzaaq ‘Afifi, ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn ‘Abdillah ibn Baz. End quote.\nSo you should point out the difference between adding alcohol or wine to food or medicine, which is prohibited, because alcohol must be poured away and destroyed, and it is not permissible to use it, and using food or medicine which contains alcohol or has been treated with alcohol. The latter is subject to further discussion; if this mixture does not cause intoxication in larger amounts, and no trace remains in it of the alcohol, then it is not regarded as khamr (intoxicant) and it is permissible to consume it.\nFor more information, please see questions no. 59899 , 177030 , 201520 and 198536 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/249339/verdict-on-adding-a-small-amount-of-alcohol-or-wine-to-food-or-drink
39258,"Is it permissible for me to return the Salam of a woman who is a stranger to me, i.e., a non-Mahram?","['Praise be to Allah.The command to spread Salam\xa0\nAllah has commanded us to spread the greeting of Salam, and has enjoined us to return the greeting to all Muslims. He has made the greeting of Salam one of the things that spread love among the believers.\xa0\nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n""When you are greeted with a greeting, greet in return with what is better than it, or (at least) return it equally. Certainly, Allah is Ever a Careful Account Taker of all things."" [An-Nisa\' 4:86]\nAnd it was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""You will not enter Paradise until you (truly) believe, and you will not (truly) believe until you love one another. Shall I not tell you something which, if you do it, you will love one another? Spread the greeting of Salam amongst yourselves."" (Narrated by Muslim, 54)\xa0\nIn the answer to question no.\xa04596 , there is a lengthy discussion on the importance of greeting with Salam and returning the greeting.\xa0\nObligation for all Muslims to initiate and return the greeting of Salam\xa0\nThe command to spread the greeting of Salam is general and applies to all the believers. It includes men greeting men and women greeting women, and a man greeting his female Mahrams. All of them are enjoined to initiate the greeting of Salam, and the other is obliged to return the greeting .\xa0\nBut there is a special ruling that applies to a man greeting a non-Mahram woman, because of the Fitnah (temptation) that may result from that in some cases.\xa0\nCan we greet non-Mahrams with Salam?\nThere is nothing wrong with a man greeting a non-Mahram woman with Salam, without shaking her hands , if she is elderly , but he should not greet a young woman with Salam when there is no guarantee that there will be no Fitnah (temptation). This is what is indicated by the comments of the scholars, may Allah have mercy on them. \xa0\nImam Malik was asked: Can a woman be greeted with Salam? He said: With regard to the elderly woman, I do not regard that as disliked, but with regard to the young woman, I do not like that.\xa0\nAz-Zarqani explained the reason why Malik did not like that, in his commentary on Al-Muwatta\': Because of the fear of Fitnah when he hears her returning the greeting.\xa0\nIn Al-Adab Ash-Shar`iyyah (1/370) it says: Ibn Muflih mentioned that Ibn Mansur said to Imam Ahmad: (What about) greeting women with Salam? He said: If the woman is old there is nothing wrong with it.\xa0\nSalih (the son of Imam Ahmad) said: I asked my father about greeting women with Salam. He said: With regard to old women, there is nothing wrong with it, but with regard to young women, they should not be prompted to speak by being made to return the Salam.\xa0\nAn-Nawawi said in his book Al-Adhkar (p. 407):\xa0\n“Our companions said: Women greeting women is like men greeting men. But when it comes to women greeting men, if the woman is the man\'s wife, or his concubine, or one of his Mahrams, then it is like him speaking to another man ; it is recommended for either of them to initiate the greeting of Salam and the other is obliged to return the greeting. But if the woman is a stranger (non-Mahram), if she is beautiful and there is the fear that he may be tempted by her, then the man should not greet her with Salam, and if he does then it is not permissible for her to reply; she should not initiate the greeting of Salam either, and if she does, she does not deserve a response. If he responds then this is disliked.\xa0\nIf she is an old woman and he will not be tempted by her, then it is permissible for her to greet the man with Salam and for the man to return her Salam.\xa0\nIf there is a group of women then a man may greet them with Salam, or if there is a group of men, they may greet a woman with Salam, so long as there is no fear that any of the parties may be tempted.\xa0\nAbu Dawud (5204) narrated that Asma’, the daughter of Yazid said: ""The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) passed by us women and greeted us with Salam."" (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud).\xa0\nAnd Al-Bukhari (6248) narrated that Sahl ibn Sa`d said: ""There was an old woman of our acquaintance who would send someone to Buda`ah (a garden of date-palms in Madinah). She would take the roots of Silq (a kind of vegetable) and put them in a cooking pot with some powdered barley. After we had prayed Jumu`ah, we would go and greet her, then she would offer (that food) to us.""\xa0\nAl-Hafidh said in Al-Fath:\xa0\n“Concerning the permissibility of men greeting women with Salam and women greeting men: what is meant by its being permitted is when there is no fear of Fitnah .\xa0\nAl-Halimi was quoted as saying: Because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was infallible and protected from Fitnah. Whoever is confident that he will be safe from temptation may greet (women) with Salam, otherwise it is safer to keep silent.\xa0\nAnd Al-Muhallab is quoted as saying: It is permissible for men to greet women with Salam and for women to greet men, if there is no fear of Fitnah.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/39258/can-we-greet-non-mahrams-with-salam
404812,"Ibn Umar reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said, “The False Messiah will come upon this marsh of Marriqanat.

It includes Muhammad ibn Ishaq, who is mudallis (one who narrates from one who met (a narrator) but did not hear it from him), and he narrated reports from others [without stating clearly that he heard the report directly from them].

67618,"Are these prayers done with the recitation out loud or quietly: the optional prayer of Maghrib, the third Rak`ah of Witr prayer when it is done like Maghrib [three consecutive Rak`ahs], Qiyam Al-Layl [voluntary prayers at night], Sunnah of Fajr, and Duha prayer?","['Praise be to Allah.Can you pray Sunnah prayer out loud?\nThe scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) stated that what is prescribed is for the worshipper to recite quietly in optional prayers offered during the day, and when praying at night, he has the choice between reciting out loud or quietly, but reciting out loud is better.\nIn Kashshaf Al-Qina` (1/441), it says that what is meant by day here is sunrise, not the break of dawn, so the regular Sunnah prayer of Fajr is a prayer that is offered at night.\nBased on that, the worshipper should recite quietly in Duha prayer, because it is a prayer that is offered during the day.\nWith regard to the optional prayer of Maghrib , the third Rak`ah or Witr, Qiyam Al-Layl and the Sunnah of Fajr , the worshipper has the choice between reciting out loud or quietly, although reciting out loud is better, unless reciting quietly helps him to focus more, or he has people with him who will be disturbed by his reciting out loud, such as one who sleeping or one who is sick, and the like.\nShaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“The Sunnah in prayers at night is to recite out loud, whether the worshipper is praying on his own or has someone else with him. If his wife or other women are praying with him , then they should pray behind him, even if there is only one woman. If he is praying on his own, then he has the choice between reciting out loud or quietly, and what is prescribed is for him to do that which help him focus more. `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) was asked about that and she said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would sometimes recite out loud in his night prayers and sometimes he would recite quietly. It is proven from him (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), in the Hadith of Hudhayfah (may Allah be pleased with him) and others, that he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to recite out loud in the night prayers; he would pause at a verse that spoke of mercy and ask for mercy, and he would pause at a verse that mentioned punishment and seek refuge with Allah from that, and he would pause at a verse that mentioned glorification of Allah and glorify Him, meaning when reciting verses that mention the divine names and attributes, so he would glorify Allah. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {There has certainly been for you in the Messenger of Allah an excellent pattern [example.]} [Al-Ahzab 33:21] And the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Pray as you have seen me praying.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari in his Sahih)\nThese Hadiths indicate that reciting out loud in the night prayers is better, and that is because it helps the heart to focus more and is more beneficial to those who are listening, unless there are people around him who are sick or sleeping, or are praying or reading Quran, in which case it is better for him to lower his voice so that he will not distract other worshippers and readers, or wake up those who are sleeping, or disturb those who are sick.\nIf he recites quietly in some of the night prayers when he is alone, there is nothing wrong with that, because of the hadith of `Aishah mentioned above, and because that may help him to focus more and may be easier for him sometimes.” (Majmu` Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 11/124-125)\nThe Shaykh (may Allah have mercy on him) also said:\n“If a person is praying by himself, it is prescribed for him to do that which will help him to focus more, of reciting out loud or quietly, if he is offering a optional prayer at night and his reciting out loud will not disturb anyone. But if there are people around him who may be disturbed by his reciting out loud, such as other worshippers, people who are reading the Quran or people who are sleeping, it is prescribed for him to keep his voice low.\nBut with regard to prayers offered during the day, such as Duha prayer , regular Sunnah prayers, Dhuhr and `Asr, the Sunnah is to recite quietly in these prayers.” (Majmu` Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 11/126-127)\nCan you pray Witr with three Rak`ahs like Maghrib?\xa0\nWith regard to the questioner mentioning the third Rak`ah of Witr prayer when it is done like Maghrib [three consecutive Rak`ahs], the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade praying Witr in the same manner as Maghrib, and he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not pray Witr with three Rak`ahs, making it like Maghrib.” (Narrated by Al-Hakim, 1/304; Al-Bayhaqi, 3/31; Ad-Daraqutni, p. 172) Al-Hafidh Ibn Hajar said in Fat-h Al-Bari (4/301): Its chain of narration is authentic according to the conditions of the two Shaykhs; Al-Bukhari and Muslim.\nHow the Prophet offered Witr prayer?\nIt is narrated in an authentic report from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that he prayed Witr with three Rak`ahs in two ways:\n\nA prayer of three Rak`ahs with two Tashahhuds and two Salams, so he prayed two Rak`ahs then said the Salam, then he prayed one Rak`ah and said the Salam.\n\nIt was narrated that Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to separate Ash-Shaf` [the even, the first two Rak`ahs of Witr] and Al-witr [the odd, the last Rak`ah of Witr] with a Taslim [saying Salam] that he made us hear.

Classed as authentic by An-Nawawi in Al-Majmu`, 4/7)\nShaykh Al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“With regard to praying five or three, sitting between each two Rak`ahs without saying the Taslim, we do not find that to be proven from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). The basic principle is that it is permissible, but because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade praying Witr with three Rak`ahs, and explained that by saying, “Do not pray Witr with three Rak`ahs, making it like Maghrib,” in that case the one who prays Witr with three Rak`ahs must avoid making it resemble Maghrib, which may be done in two ways:\nThe first is by saying the Taslim between Ash-shaf` [the even, the first two Rak`ahs of Witr] and Al-witr [the odd, the last Rak`ah of Witr], which is the stronger view and is preferable; and the second is by not sitting [for Tashahhud] between the first two Rak`ahs and the last Rak`ah.
