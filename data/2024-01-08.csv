201417,"We often find written in people’s messages the verse {And your Lord is going to give you, and you will be satisfied} [al-Duha 93:5], which Allah addressed to His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Does the blessing mentioned in this verse include everyone?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nWriting this verse in messages comes under the heading of quoting from the Book of Allah, may He be exalted. We have noted previously that quoting [from the Quran] is permissible in general terms, if it is done for a valid reason, but if it is not done for a valid reason, then it is not permissible.\nSecondly:\nThe words of Allah, may He be exalted, to His Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), {And your Lord is going to give you, and you will be satisfied} [al-Duha 93:5] mean that He, may He be glorified and exalted, will give His slave and Messenger Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), by His grace and bounty, that which would make him satisfied in this world and the hereafter.\nAl-Shawkani (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhat appears to be the case is that Allah, may He be glorified, would give him what would please him of the best of this world and the hereafter, and one of the most important of these things to him and one of the most significant is the acceptance of his intercession for his ummah.""(Fath al-Qadir\xa0 5/649).\nSuch a thing obviously cannot be for everyone. To suggest that Allah would give to a specific person until he is content and satisfied is not permissible, except on the basis of a religious text.\nThirdly:\nThe ruling on quoting this verse varies from one situation to another:\n\nIf it is quoted by way of being optimistic, there is nothing wrong with that.\nIf it is quoted by way of showing care to a Muslim who is suffering and shows patience – so one says to him for example: Be patient and your Lord will give you, and you will be satisfied, in sha Allah – there is nothing wrong with that either, because this comes under the heading of offering consolation and thinking positively of Allah, especially if he follows it by saying “in sha Allah.”\nIf it is quoted by way of being certain of receiving good reward from Allah until one is satisfied, that is not permissible, because no one can decide what Allah, may He be exalted, should do, either in this world or in the hereafter.\nIf it is quoted by someone by way of claiming that that is the reason why Allah restored to him what he had lost, that is not permissible either.\n\nPlease see the answer to question no. 134346 .\nIf it is quoted in general terms when sending a message, or it is quoted in a gathering, or a person writes it on social media and the like, in general terms, then that is not permitted either, because generalising it means that all good and bad things may be included. One of these bad things is what the questioner has mentioned, of imagining this blessing reaching all people, which is definitely impossible and it is attributing to Allah, may He be exalted, something that is not true and it is praising someone who does not deserve to be praised at all.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/201417/does-the-blessing-mentioned-in-the-verse-and-your-lord-is-going-to-give-you-and-you-will-be-satisfied-include-all-the-ummah
138389,Can you advise me as to how a seeker of knowledge can make a schedule to organise his time?,"[""Praise be to Allah.Status of seeking knowledge in Islam\xa0\nThe status of seeking Islamic knowledge is great in Islam. Allah, may He be blessed and Exalted, has praised knowledge and those who seek it, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Say: Are those who know equal to those who know not?’ It is only men of understanding who will remember (i.e. get a lesson from Allah's Signs and Verses.)” [Az-Zumar 39:9]\n“It is only those who have knowledge among His slaves that fear Allah.” [Fatir 35:28]\xa0\nHumayd ibn `Abd Ar-Rahman (may Allah have mercy on him) said: I heard Mu`awiyah say, when he was delivering a khutbah: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “When Allah wills good for a person, He deepens his knowledge of Islam. (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 71; and Muslim, 1037)\xa0\n`Abu Ad-Darda’ (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “Whoever follows a path in the pursuit of knowledge, Allah will make easy for him a path to Paradise. The angels lower their wings in approval of the seeker of knowledge , and everyone in the heavens and on earth prays for forgiveness for the seeker of knowledge, even the fish in the sea. The superiority of the scholar over the worshipper is like the superiority of the moon over all other heavenly bodies. The scholars are the heirs of the Prophets, for the Prophets did not leave behind Dinars or Dirhams, rather they left behind knowledge, so whoever takes it has taken a great share.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 2682, Abu Dawud, 3541 and Ibn Majah, 223; classed as sound by Al-Albaani in Saheeh At-Targheeb, 1/17)\nIslamic knowledge brings a person the good of this world and of the Hereafter; it takes precedence over all other branches of knowledge, especially if one’s intention is pure.\xa0\nHow to start your journey of seeking knowledge in Islam\nThe best thing you can spend your time on when beginning to seek knowledge is memorising the Book of Allah , may He be Glorified and Exalted. This is the best thing in which people may compete and strive, and it is the best thing on which the seeker of knowledge may focus his efforts.\xa0\nHow to make seeking knowledge an easy task\nOne of the things that will make things easier for the seeker of knowledge is to have many shaykhs and scholars from whom he can learn . The quickest way to seek knowledge and the best way to attain the goal is if Allah makes it easy for him to find one shaykh or scholar among the scholars of the Sunnah, from whom he may acquire knowledge directly.\xa0\nHow knowledge seekers organise their time\nWith regard to organising your time, it may be as follows.\xa0\n\nHave fixed times for regular things every day, such as a time for sleeping, a time for meals, a time for visits, a time for gatherings, a time for revision.\xa0\n\n\nOne of the things that will help you make the most of your time and save time is to put a stop to time wasters such as sleeping, eating and drinking too much, or meeting people except for Islamically beneficial purposes. You should also avoid time wasters such as means of entertainment like TV shows, soap operas, newspapers, magazines, games, sports matches and competitions.\xa0\n\nShaykh Muhammad ibn Salih Al-`Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“The seeker of knowledge must make the most of his time and avoid wasting time. Wasting time may take the following forms:\xa0\n\nFailing to review and revise what he reads\nSitting with his friends and engaging in idle talk in which there is no benefit\nThe most harmful time waster for the seeker of knowledge is when he has no interest except finding out about people, what they are saying and what they are doing, with regard to a matter that does not concern him. This undoubtedly stems from a weakness of commitment to Islam, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Part of a person’s being a good Muslim is leaving alone that which does not concern him.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 2318; classed as authentic by Al-Albani)\n\nFocusing on who said what and asking a lot of questions is a waste of time. In fact it is a kind of sickness which if it affects a person – we ask Allah to keep us safe and sound – will become his main focus and concern and he may end up showing a hostile attitude towards one who does not deserve enmity, or he may be friendly towards one who does not deserve friendship, because of his interest in these matters that are distracting him from seeking knowledge, on the grounds that this is part of supporting the truth. But that is not the case; rather this comes under the heading of being distracted by that which does not concern one. But if news comes to you without you seeking it or looking for it, everyone receives news but you should not be preoccupied with it or focus on it, because this causes distraction for the seeker of knowledge and may confuse him, and it opens the door to partisanship and division amongst the ummah.” (Kitab Al-`Ilm, pp. 143-144)\xa0\n\nAnother matter that is detrimental to the issue of organising one’s time and making the most of it is procrastination. Procrastination is a severe disease that deprives one of many good things in this world and in the Hereafter.\xa0\n\n\nOne of the best ways of succeeding in this world is to keep yourself busy at all times with that which is best for you and most beneficial for you in the Hereafter, as Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The best act of worship is to strive to please the Lord at all times by doing that which is most appropriate and is expected at any particular time.” (Madarij As-Salikin, 1/88)\xa0\n\n\nInvesting one’s time as much as one can and not wasting a single moment in anything that is not an act of obedience or worship. Our early generations (may Allah have mercy on them) set an amazing example of making the most of their time. All seekers of Quranic knowledge were keen to study under Abu Na`im Al-Asfahani (may Allah have mercy on him; d. 430) and every day one of them would have his turn and he would study whatever he wanted with the Shaykh until just before Dhuhr. Then when he got up to go home, another student might recite a Juz’ to him on the way (for him to listen and correct), and he never showed any impatience.\xa0\n\nSalim Ar-Razi (may Allah have mercy on him) was a Shafi`i. One day he went home and came back, and he said: I recited a juz’ on my way. Adh-Dhahabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his biography of Al-Khatib Al-Baghdadi: Al-Khatib used to walk with a Juz’ in his hand, which he would study.\xa0\nFor forty years, Ibn `Asakir (may Allah have mercy on him) – as his son said – did not focus on anything except matters of knowledge, even during his free time or when he was alone. He always had with him books of knowledge and the Quran, which he would read and memorise. They were always keen to make the most of their time by doing more than one thing at the same time. If the pen became blunt and he needed to sharpen it, one of them would move his lips with remembrance of Allah whilst fixing his pen, or he would review things that he had memorised lest any time pass without him doing something useful.\xa0\nAbu Al-Wafa’ `Ali ibn `Aqil (may Allah have mercy on him) said: I do not allow myself to waste even one hour of my life; even when I am not reading anything or reciting anything, I would think whilst I am resting of some issues of knowledge and I will not get up until I have come up with something I can write down.\xa0\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: I know someone who fell sick with a headache and fever, and his book was beside his head. When he was awake he would read, and when he fell asleep he would put it down.\xa0\nSuggested schedule for knowledge seekers in Islam\xa0\nWith regard to making a schedule and organising one’s time, that may be done as follows:\xa0\n\nThe program of the seeker of knowledge begins at dawn, which is the time for memorisation of Quran and Hadith. The best time for memorising – especially memorising Quran – is the time just before dawn and after Fajr prayer, when the mind is clear and it is easier to memorise. So the seeker of knowledge prays in the mosque and remains there until sunrise or afterwards, memorising and reviewing what he has memorised. When he has finished that, he begins to memorise texts of knowledge – the texts of Hadith, Fiqh, Usool [principles of Fiqh] and Arabic language.\xa0\nIf he has a job or is in school, he goes to it. Otherwise he spends the rest of the morning memorising and revising until Dhuhr, then he takes a siesta and rests a little.\xa0\nAs for the afternoon, it is for studying and reading, or studying with others, or discussion and reviewing issues of knowledge with others.\xa0\nAfter Maghrib, he attends study circles and after `Isha’ he reviews what he has learnt or he may read a new book.\xa0\n\nIt should be noted that what we have mentioned here comes under the heading of organising time in general terms. Each student should organise his time according to his circumstances, whether he is working or not, whether he is married or single, whether he devotes all his time to Islamic knowledge or he has some other preoccupations, and so on. What matters with regard to organising time is that there should be some hours of the day and night in which he makes himself memorise and read. People tend to want to rest and like to be somewhat lazy, so he should train himself to work hard and be active, and he should make himself get used to being organised and adhere to doing acts of worship and obedience. Otherwise he will have wasted his day and then he will have wasted his life.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/138389/how-knowledge-seekers-organise-their-time
225512,"What is the meaning of Ibn al-Jawzi’s words, “If you see that the hadith is contrary to reason, then know that it is fabricated”, when many hadiths are contrary to reason, such as the Prophet’s holding the neck of the jinni and the creation of camels from the jinn, and the tree which came to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and others?","['Praise be to Allah.Everything that is soundly narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is in accordance with reason and sound human nature, and it is not possible that sound reason could contradict the soundly narrated religious texts under any circumstances.\nBut sometimes the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) may say something bewildering that we cannot grasp by means of our reasoning. But the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) never said anything that is impossible according to reason and that reason cannot accept.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhat is narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is all true and the religious texts corroborate one another. It is in accordance with sound human nature and in accordance with what is instilled in humans of sound reasoning and what they know of sound aims and objectives. So the religious texts do not contradict sound reasoning, sound objectives or sound human nature, and they do not contradict other sound narrations from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Rather the one who thinks that there are contradictions is the one who believes in some un-soundly narrated hadiths, or he has understood from the text something that it does not indicate, or he believed in some idea that he thought was based on sound reasoning when in fact it was based on ignorance, or it was based on one’s inspirational understanding when in fact it is based on flawed thinking; this applies when his understanding is contrary to a soundly-narrated report from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Or he may contradict, on the basis of sound reasoning or sound understanding, a report that he thinks is narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), but in fact it is falsely attributed to him, or he may contradict a report because of a word that he thinks means one thing, but in fact it means something else.""(Al-Risalah al-‘Arshiyyah\xa0p.35).\nHe also said:\nWhatever contradicts sound reasoning is wrong. There is nothing wrong in the Quran, Sunnah and scholarly consensus, but there are some words which some people may not understand, or they understand them incorrectly. Thus the problem is with them, not with the Quran and Sunnah.""(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa\xa0 11/490).\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe Messengers (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not say anything that is impossible according to reason and definitely cannot be true according to reason; rather what is narrated from them is of two types:\ni. That which reason and sound human nature testify to be sound.\nii. That which reason on its own cannot grasp, such as matters of the unseen of which the Messengers spoke, including details about al-barzakh and the Last Day, and details of reward and punishment. What is mentioned in these reports is not something that is completely impossible according to reason, and any report whose content one may think is impossible on the basis of reason is one of two things: either it is fabricated or falsely attributed to the Messengers, or that individual’s human reasoning is corrupt, so he imagines that there is something wrong with it and thinks that his view is based on sound reasoning.""(Al-Ruh (p, 62); see also: al-Sawa‘iq al-Mursalah\xa0 3/829-830).\nBased on that, the words of Ibn al-Jawzi (may Allah have mercy on him) –\n“How good is the comment of the one who said: If you see that the hadith is contrary to reason, or contrary to some other, soundly narrated report, or contrary to the basic principles of Islam, then know that it is fabricated. (Tadrib al-Rawi, 1/327) –\nmean: one of the signs of the fabricated hadith is that it is contrary to sound reason, or to a sound report, or to a basic principle that Muslims adhere to and are agreed on.\nWhat is meant by it being contrary to sound reason is that the hadith says something that reason rejects, such as the hadith which says, “Allah created the horse and let it run and sweat, then He created Himself from its sweat.”\nAl-Suyuti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThis cannot have been fabricated by a Muslim or one of sound mind; the one who is accused of fabricating it is Muhammad ibn Shuja‘, who was a deviant.""(Tadrib al-Rawi\xa0 1/328).\nWhen a sahih hadith mentions something that human reason cannot grasp because of its shortcomings – such as some prophetic miracles, or some matters of the unseen – this is called “what reason cannot grasp,” and it is not to be called “what reason deems impossible,” because it is not contrary to reason; rather it makes reason unable to grasp it and wonder what exactly is meant. So the individual either accepts the report and admits his inability to grasp it, which is the response of the believer, or he rejects it, which is the response of the ignorant disbeliever.\nThe fact that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed the Sahabi to call the tree, so he called it and it followed him, or the fact that he held the jinni [by the throat] and throttled him until he felt the coolness of his saliva between his fingers, are signs of prophethood in which we must believe, if the report is sound. The Muslim increases in faith thereby, and the disbeliever increases in disbelief. There is nothing in rational thinking to dictate that such events should be deemed impossible or such reports should be deemed false, even though reason, on its own, is unable to grasp such things or understand them, or determine whether they happened or not, without these reports.\nAs for the hadith, “Pray in sheep folds but do not pray in camel pens, for they are created from the devils” (narrated by Ibn Majah (769); classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah),\naccording to the well-known view, it does not mean that they were created from the devils in a real sense. Rather what is meant is that eating camel meat gives a person aggressive and devilish characteristics, so the one who eats it may acquire such characteristics, because in the make-up of the camel, there is a characteristic that makes it resemble the jinn in being unfriendly and wanting to harm people. Hence the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed people to do wudu’ after eating camel meat, and he forbade praying in the camel pens.\nSee: Majmu‘ al-Fatawa by Ibn Taymiyah (20/523, 21/10) and Hashiyat Ibn ‘Abidin (1/380).\nFor more information, please see the answer the question no. 6981 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/225512/sound-reasoning-does-not-contradict-sound-proven-religious-texts
104256,"I have a brother who is fifteen years old, and I would like you to write a message to him explaining the Islamic rulings having to do with this period of his life, with regard to puberty, purification, wet dreams and other matters pertaining to men, and everything having to do with that age, because I am not sure that he understands, and I am afraid that he is praying without having purified himself properly. I also would like some advice for him, and I hope that you will pray for him, asking Allah to send him good friends. May Allah reward you with the best reward.","['Praise be to Allah.What does Islam say about adolescence?\nWe ask Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, to guide your brother and all the young Muslims, to show them the right way, open their hearts to faith, and make things easy for them.\nThe stage of adolescence is one of the most dangerous stages that a human being goes through in his entire life, as during this stage he undergoes physical, mental, emotional and sexual changes, and the devil is very keen to tempt him during this stage.\nHow to deal with adolescents in Islam\nFrom studying what specialists and educators have said about this matter, we find that they offer the following advice:\n\nTry hard to connect the young person with righteous friends, for making friends with righteous people will make him inclined towards righteousness, because friends influence a person. As the saying goes: Do not ask about a person; rather ask about his friends, for everyone follows the example of his friends.\n\nSo he should look for good friends who adhere to religious teachings, so that he can join them, worship Allah with them, attend prayers in congregation with them, and seek beneficial knowledge with them.\nWe ask Allah, may He be Exalted, to enable your brother to find righteous friends who can help and encourage him to do good.\n\nTry hard to fill his time with activities that are beneficial and useful in both religious and worldly terms, and do not leave him with free time, for that is one of the greatest causes of trouble at this stage. Sign him up for any purposeful communal activities in your area, so that he can benefit and bring benefit to others.\nHasten to arrange his marriage, if possible, for the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “O young men, whoever among you can afford it, let him get married, for it is more effective in lowering the gaze and guarding one’s chastity. And whoever cannot afford it, let him fast, for it will be a shield for him.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 5066, and Muslim, 3464)\nOffer a great deal of Du`a for him, asking Allah to bless him and guide him.\nEncourage him to do acts of worship and to keep away from everything that is prohibited, dubious or disliked.\nDo not let him use modern means of communication in improper ways; keep him away from them, except for what is essential. So, for example, do not let him use the Internet in an isolated part of the house, such as in a closed room. The way to do that is to put the computer in a shared area of the house, so that the boy cannot be alone, watching anything that he should not watch.\n\nThese were a few useful guidelines on this topic.\nFiqhi issues related to adolescence\nWith regard to religious duties that are required of the one who reaches puberty, we cannot mention them all in detail in a single answer. But we can highlight the most important of these duties, then refer the questioner to some books from which he can learn more about this matter. Hence we say:\n\nFirstly: when the young person reaches puberty, he is obliged to adhere to all the rulings of Islam, by doing what is enjoined and refraining from what is forbidden. He must pray, fast Ramadan, give Zakah if he is one of those for whom it is obligatory, and go for Hajj if he is able for it.\n\nAs prayer is not valid without purification, the one who reaches the age of accountability must learn the rulings on prayer, because Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “when you rise to [perform] prayer, wash your faces and your forearms to the elbows and wipe over your heads and wash your feet to the ankles” [Al-Ma’idah 5:6].\nIt was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The prayer of one who passes something is not accepted, until he does Wudu.” A man said: What does passing something mean, O Abu Hurayrah? He said: Breaking wind, silently or loudly. (Narrated by Al-Bukhari (135)\nIt was narrated that Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “No prayer is accepted without Wudu, and no charity is accepted from stolen war booty.” (Narrated by Muslim, 557).\nA description of how to do Wudu is given in the answer to question no.\xa011497 . The rulings on doing Ghusl in the case of Janabah is given in the answers to questions no.\xa010790 and\xa02648 .\nWith regard to things that invalidate Wudu, please see questions no.\xa014321 and\xa011591 .\nOne of the signs of puberty is the growth of coarse hair in the pubic area and armpits. One of the Sunnahs of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) concerning that is to pluck the armpit hair and shave the pubic hair. This is explained in questions no.\xa026266 ,\xa09037 and\xa01177 .\n\nSecondly: if something becomes obligatory upon an accountable person, it is obligatory for him to learn the rulings on it, because no one can follow a command unless he understands it and learns the rulings on it.\n\nAl-Qarrafi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Anwar Al-Buruq (2/148):\n“Al-Ghazali stated in Ihya’ `Ulum Ad-Din, as did Ash-Shafi`i in Ar-Risalah, that there is consensus that it is not permissible for one who is accountable to do any action until he knows the rulings of Allah concerning it. Whoever wants to engage in buying and selling must learn the Islamic rulings concerning that; whoever wants to rent or hire anything must learn what Allah, may He be Exalted, has prescribed with regard to renting and hiring; whoever wants to lend or borrow anything must learn the rulings of Allah, may He be Exalted, concerning that; whoever wants to pray must learn the rulings of Allah, may He be Exalted, with regard to that prayer; and the same applies to purification and all other words and deeds. Whoever learns and acts in accordance with what he has learned has obeyed Allah, may He be Exalted, on two counts. Whoever does not learn and does not act has disobeyed Allah on two counts. Whoever learns but does not act in accordance with what he has learned has obeyed Allah, may He be Exalted, in one way and has disobeyed Him in one way.”\xa0\nLearning about religious duties is easy for the one for whom Allah makes it easy, so let each one strive to learn and acquire beneficial knowledge and act upon it, and let him ask his Lord for guidance.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/104256/how-to-deal-with-adolescents-in-islam
