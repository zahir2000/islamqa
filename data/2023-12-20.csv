335145,"I read on a website the words “Let Allah work through you and trust Him, for the whole universe is running in the most beautiful way, so why would He be unable to take care of you? Why should you worry or fear for yourself? Roses do not worry and neither do stars.” Is it permissible to speak in this way?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly: trusting in Allah and relying on Him is something that is required according to Islamic teachings\nTrusting in Allah, depending on Him and relying on Him is something that is required according to Islamic teachings, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{To Allah belongs all that is unseen in the heavens and on earth, and to Him all things will return. So worship Him [alone] and put your trust in Him, for your Lord is not unaware of what you do}\xa0[Hud 11:123]\n{Put your trust in the Ever-Living Who never dies, and glorify and praise Him. Your Lord is sufficiently aware of the sins of His slaves}\xa0[Al-Furqan 25:58]\n{Put your trust in Allah, for sufficient is Allah as a disposer of affairs}\xa0[Al-Ahzab 33:3].\nAllah, may He be exalted, is the Disposer of affairs Who is taking care of His slaves; He is the Provider who provides for them; He is the Most Merciful and no one is more merciful to them than Him; He is the Sustainer by Whom everything is sustained. Whoever puts his trust in Allah, He will suffice him; whoever turns to Him, He will guide him; whoever believes in Him, He will provide for him; whoever relies on Him, He will not let him down.\nAllah, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Whoever fears Allah, He will grant him a way out [from difficulty],\nand will provide for him from where he does not expect. Whoever puts his trust in Allah, He will suffice him. Allah will surely attain His purpose. Allah has set a measure [and appointed term] for all things}\xa0[Al-Talaq 65:2-3].\nAhmad (205) narrated from ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab that he heard the Prophet of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “If you were to put your trust in Allah as you should, you would be given provision like the birds: they go out hungry in the morning and come back with full bellies in the evening.”\nAs the entire universe is running by the might of Allah and is under His control, how could Allah not be able to look after His slaves’ affairs? As Allah has guaranteed to provide and care for His slaves, then why worry?\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{There is no creature that lives on the earth but its sustenance is guaranteed by Allah. He knows its dwelling place and its resting place; all is [inscribed] in a clear record}\xa0[Hud 11:6].\nWhatever befalls a person of exhaustion, fatigue or worry, Allah will expiate his sins thereby, and whatever happens was already decreed before the individual was created, so what is the benefit of feeling depressed or troubled?\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{No calamity befalls the earth or your own selves but it is already written in a Book before We make it happen. Verily, that is easy for Allah.\n[Know this] so that you do not grieve for what passes you by, nor exult over what He gives you, for Allah does not love anyone who is conceited and boastful}\xa0[al-Hadid 57:22-23].\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “No fatigue, constant pain, worry, grief, harm or distress befalls a believer, not even a thorn that pricks him, but Allah will expiate some of his sins thereby.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (5642) and Muslim (2573).\nSecondly: what is required of the individual is to observe proper etiquette when addressing the Lord of the Worlds\nThe words mentioned are correct, as they invite people to trust and rely on Allah, and not be worried or distressed. But the way the phrase “Let Allah work through you” is worded is not correct and is not appropriate to the majesty of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. For Allah does not need permission from anyone and He does not act through anyone – exalted and sanctified be Allah. For no one could ward off His bounty or prevent it from reaching anyone. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Whatever Allah opens up for people of His mercy, none can withhold it, and whatever He withholds, none can grant it thereafter. And He is the Almighty, the Most Wise}\xa0[Fatir 35:2]\n{If Allah afflicts you with harm, none can remove it but He; if He wills some good for you, none can avert His bounty, which He bestows upon whomever He will among His slaves. And He is the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful}\xa0[Yunus 10:107].\nOne of the supplications and adhkar of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), when he had finished the obligatory prayer, was to say: “La ilaha illa Allah wahdahu laa sharika lah, lahu al-mulk wa lahu’l-hamd wa huwa ‘ala kulli shay’in qadir. Allahumma la mani‘a lima a‘tayta wa la mu‘tiya lima mana‘ta wa la yanfa‘u dha’l-jaddi minka al-jadd (There is no god worthy of worship except Allah alone, with no partner or associate; His is the Dominion, to Him be praise, and He has power over all things. O Allah, none can withhold what You give and none can give what You withhold, and the good fortune of any fortunate person is to no avail against You.)”\nNarrated by al-Bukhari (6615) and Muslim (593) from al-Mughirah ibn Shu‘bah.\nImam al-Bukhari included this hadith in a chapter in his Sahih entitled Chapter: None can withhold what Allah gives.\nIn Sahih Muslim (477) it is narrated that Abu Sa‘id al-Khudri said: When the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) raised his head after bowing, he would say: “Our Lord, to You be praise, filling the heavens and the earth, and filling whatever You will besides that. You are worthy of praise and glorification; this is the truest thing that a slave can say, and all of us are Your slaves. O Allah, none can withhold what You give and none can give what You withhold, and the good fortune of any fortunate person is to no avail against You.”\nEven though the one who spoke these words meant nothing but good, what is required is to adhere to proper etiquette when addressing the Lord of the Worlds and speaking of Him, and we must be careful to speak of Allah in words that are appropriate to His greatness, majesty and affection.\nThe individual is the doer of his deeds, by his choice and will, but Allah is the Creator of him and his will. He knows what he will do, and He, may He be glorified, helps and guides whomever He wills of His slaves; if they are deprived of His help and guidance, they will go astray. Hence the people of Paradise will say (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Praise be to Allah Who has guided us to this, for we would never have been guided if Allah had not guided us}\xa0[Al-A‘raf 7:43].\nWe ask Allah to guide us and help us to do that which He loves and which pleases Him.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/335145/is-it-permissible-to-say-let-allah-work-through-you-and-trust-him
121759,"Here in Kuwait, discount coupons are distributed to university students, for a discount between 5-25% for many places, such as restaurants, clothing stores and bookstores, et cetera. These discounts are obtained by buying coupons for the discounts, the cost of which is five dinars. There are some people who say that this price covers advertising costs or other expenses of the company that distributes these coupons. Is it permissible to buy these coupons and use them?","['Praise be to Allah.Types of coupons\nDiscount coupons that are issued by advertising and marketing companies, or by travel companies, or some shopping centres, which give a certain discount on the prices of goods and services offered by a group of companies or other organisations, may be divided into two categories:\n\nCoupons that are obtained in return for payment through an annual subscription.\nFree coupons which are obtained as gifts to purchasers to encourage them to buy from companies. They may be given for free to anyone whose purchases reach a certain limit.\n\nPaid for coupons\nAs for the coupons which are obtained in return for payment, they are prohibited, because they involve several infractions of Islamic teachings, including the following:\n\nAmbiguity, because the purchaser pays a certain amount of money for the coupons, with the aim of obtaining a discount, but it is not known how much this discount really is. He may not use the coupon, or he may use it and get a discount that is less or more than what he paid.\xa0\n\nThe Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade transactions involving ambiguity. Narrated by Muslim (1513). This includes every transaction in which there is an unknown element.\n\nThis transaction is based on risk, because there may be gain or loss. The purchaser risks the amount he paid in return for the coupons, then he will either gain if he gets a discount that is greater than what he paid, or he will lose, if the discount is less than what he paid. This is the essence of gambling which is prohibited according to Islamic teachings:\n\n{O you who have believed, indeed, intoxicants, gambling, [sacrificing on] stone alters [to other than Allah ], and divining arrows are but defilement from the work of Satan, so avoid it that you may be successful}\xa0[Al-Ma’idah 5:90].\n\nThese coupons deceive people, cheat them and take their wealth unlawfully, because most of these promised discounts are illusionary and are not real.\n\nMany shopkeepers raise their prices, then give the impression to the coupon holder that they are giving him a discount, when in fact the discount is on the increase they made when they raised the price above the price in other stores.\n\nThese coupons often cause disputes, because the company that issues the coupons has no power to compel shopping centres, companies and stores to give the percentage of discount that was agreed upon, and that leads to disputes and conflicts.\n\nWhatever is a cause of dispute, conflict and rancour must be disallowed, as Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Satan only wants to cause between you animosity and hatred through intoxicants and gambling and to avert you from the remembrance of Allah and from prayer. So will you not desist}\xa0[Al-Ma’idah 5:91].\n\nThese types of coupons are detrimental to the shopkeepers who do not participate in the discount program.\n\n“Dealing with the coupons mentioned leads to the stirring up of enmity and rancour among shopkeepers, between those who participate in the discount program and those who do not participate, as products sell out in the stores that give the discount, whereas those who do not participate in the discount program get stuck with products that do not sell.” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah,\xa014/10)\n\nThe subscription fees paid for these coupons are not in return for any real gain. If the purchaser asks the shopkeeper to give him the discount, he may get the discount that was promised by those who sold the coupons, or a similar discount, or he may not get any discount at all, in which case he will have paid for the coupon without getting anything in return. This comes under the heading of consuming people’s wealth unlawfully, which is prohibited according to the Quranic text (interpretation of the meaning):{O you who have believed, do not consume one another’s wealth unjustly }\xa0[An-Nisa’ 4:29].\n\nThe Fiqh Council of the Muslim World League issued a statement in its eighteenth session stating that it is prohibited to deal in these coupons. Among other things, they stated:\n“After listening to the research presented on this topic and a great deal of discussion, it was determined that it is not permissible to issue or purchase the discount coupons mentioned, if that is in return for payment of a specific price or an annual subscription, because it involves ambiguity. That is because the one who purchases the coupon pays money but does not know what he will get in return for it, thus loss is certain in return for possible gain.”\nSimilarly, the Permanent Committee for Ifta’ stated that it is prohibited to deal in this type of discount coupons. This was also stated in Fatwas issued by Shaykh Ibn Baz and Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on them). (See:\xa0Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah\xa0(14/6) and\xa0Fatawa Ibn Baaz,\xa019/58)\nFree coupons\nWith regard to free coupons that are offered to purchasers without them having to pay anything in return, there is nothing wrong with using them and benefitting from them, because giving coupons for free comes under the heading of a gift , and ambiguity with regard to gifts is overlooked.\nMoreover, if the one who receives a free coupon does not use it to get a discount, he does not lose anything.\nThis was mentioned in a statement of the Fiqh Council in which it said: “If the discount coupons are issued for free, without having to pay anything, then issuing them and accepting them is permissible according to Islamic teachings, because it comes under the heading of a promise of a gift.”\nFor more information, please see:\n\nBitaqat At-Takhfid: Haqiqatuha At-Tijariyyah wa Ahkamuha Ash-Shar‘iyyah, by Shaykh Bakr Abu Zayd.\nAl-Hawafiz At-Tijariyyah At-Taswiqiyyah wa Ahkamuha fi’l-Fiqh Al-Islami\xa0by Dr, Khalid Al-Muslih.\n\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 3223 and 8938 .\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/121759/are-discount-coupons-permissible-in-islam
467842,Is it permissible for one who is not fasting to eat the meals that are distributed in al-Masjid al-Nabawi for those who are fasting to break their fast?,"['Praise be to Allah.It is permissible for those who are not fasting to eat the food that is offered on the mats that are put out in al-Masjid al-Haram and al-Masjid al-Nabawi for those who are fasting to break their fast. That is because the custom is that those who offer this food put out those mats and do not prevent anyone from taking food, and they do not only call those who are fasting, and they are aware that many of those present are not fasting. So this is permission, according to custom, for anyone to take that food. This is something that all people are aware of, and a custom of which all people are aware comes under the same ruling as that which is stated verbally. So there is no reason why those who are not fasting should not eat these meals.\nShaykh ‘Abdullah al-Maqdisi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: When someone gives an invitation to a meal and serves the food, that is permission to eat, because of the report narrated by Abu Hurayrah from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), who said: “If one of you is invited to a meal, and he comes with the messenger who was sent to invite him, that is permission [to eat].” Narrated by Ahmad and Abu Dawud. ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud said: If you have been invited, then you have been given permission [to eat]. This was narrated by Imam Ahmad with his isnad…\nIn al-Ghunyah – by Shaykh ‘Abd al-Qadir al-Jili (may Allah be pleased with him) – it says: No permission is needed after the food is served, if the custom in that land is that the people eat when the food is served, because the custom itself is permission to eat.""(Sharh Dalil al-Talib\xa03/313).\nBut if there are ready-made meals that are only intended for those who are fasting, then it is not permissible for those who are not fasting to eat them, unless permission is given by those who are distributing them, after telling them about the situation, if they are authorised to give such permission.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/467842/can-those-who-are-not-fasting-eat-the-food-that-is-put-out-for-iftar-in-al-masjid-al-nabawi-the-prophets-mosque
105325,I work as a web designer. The websites I design do not contain pictures of women or pictures that are not Islamically acceptable. I do not use songs or music in my designs. All I do is design the site page. Is my work permissible? Is the money I earn permissible or prohibited?,"['Praise be to Allah.Is graphic designing prohibited in Islam?\xa0\nThis is an issue that is of widespread concern nowadays, as the result of the spread of sin and all kinds of prohibited things. There is hardly any field in which Satan does not try to spread evil in it, to such an extent that the Muslims are becoming very confused about what is permissible and what is prohibited, and it has become very difficult for them to purify their earnings and avoid any prohibited elements in them. Allah is sufficient for the pious and for His believing slaves. He sees that they want to obey Him and hate to disobey Him, and He will reward them and grant them forgiveness. \xa0\nIn Islamic Shari`ah, one of the principles of permissible business and trade is that it should not be something by means of which Allah is disobeyed, so it should not be a means of sinning or lead to falling into prohibitions. When Islam forbids a thing, it also forbids everything that may lead to it or help with it, and Islam enjoins blocking all the means that lead to it.\nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Help you one another in Al-Birr and At-Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression. And fear Allah. Verily, Allah is Severe in punishment.” [Al-Ma’idah 5:2]\nShaykh `Abd Ar-Rahman As-Sa`di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“One is required to refrain from every sin and act of wrongdoing, and to help others to refrain also.” (Tafsir As-Sa`di, p. 218)\xa0\nIt says in Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah (3/140):\xa0\n“According to the majority of jurists it is not acceptable to sell grapes to one who will use them to make wine, or to sell means of gambling to a gambler, or a house that will be used as a church, or to sell wood to one who will make it into a cross, or to sell copper to one who will make it into a bell. The same applies to everything which it is known that the purchaser intends to use for something that is not permissible.”\nIf the seller, designer or producer, is certain that what he designs will be used for prohibited purposes , it is not permissible for him to sell it or produce it. The same ruling applies if he thinks that is most likely, even if he is not certain.\xa0\nHowever, if he is in doubt or does not know how the item he is selling or producing will be used, then there is no harm in selling it and designing it, and the sin will fall on the one who uses it for prohibited purposes. \xa0\nIbn Hazm (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“It is not permissible to sell anything to one who will certainly use it to disobey Allah, and such transactions are permanently null and void, such as selling anything that may be squeezed or pressed to one who it is certain will use it to make alcohol, or selling a slave to one who it is certain will mistreat his slave, or selling weapons or horses to those who it is certain will use them to attack the Muslims, or selling silk to one who it is certain will wear it, and so on, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Help you one another in Al-Birr and At-Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression. And fear Allah. Verily, Allah is Severe in punishment.” [Al-Ma’idah 5:2]\nThe kinds of transactions that we have mentioned are obviously kinds of cooperating in sin and transgression, without going into detail, so annulling them is cooperating in righteousness and piety.\xa0\nIf no such thing is known for certain, then the transaction is valid, because it is not helping in sin. If the purchaser disobeys Allah after that, then the sin is on the purchaser only and not on the seller.” (Al-Muhalla, 7/522)\xa0\nThe same ruling applies to the brother who asked the question:\xa0\nIf someone comes to you and you know that he wants to design a website that he will use for prohibited purposes, such as Riba-based banking or indecent pictures or selling prohibited things such as alcohol , pork or cigarettes, or websites for movies and music , then it is not permissible for you to design the website for him, and it is not permissible for you to help him in the evil that he wants to do; rather what you must do is advise him and guide him and remind him to fear Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted.\xa0\nNonetheless, if you do not know anything about the reason he is asking for website design, or if the site will most likely be used for permissible and beneficial things, then there is nothing wrong with you designing it and selling it, even if the owner will include some prohibited things in it, because the rulings of Shari`ah are based on what is most likely to be the case and not on rare instances.\xa0\nIs it permissible to use pictures of children in graphic designs?\nWith regard to the ruling on including pictures of children on the websites that you design, that is not permissible. We have stated previously that it is prohibited to make images, whether they are drawn by hand or made with a machine (a camera), and no exceptions are made from this ruling except that which is absolutely necessary, such as pictures in passports and other things that are needed.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/105325/can-a-muslim-work-as-a-web-designer
