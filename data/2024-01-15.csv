309254,"How can we reconcile between the two following hadiths? The first hadith is “Whoever does you a favour, then reciprocate him, and if you cannot find anything with which to reciprocate him, then offer supplication for him until you think that you have reciprocated him.” The second hadith is: “Whoever intervenes for his brother and he gives him a gift for that and he accepts it, he has engaged in a major form of riba.” I am confused about this matter, because we have a colleague who helps us with some personal issues of ours and looks after our interests in some other government departments, not as part of his job or his specialty, but out of generosity on his part. Can we reciprocate him for that or not?","['Praise be to Allah.It was narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does you a favour, then reciprocate him, and if you cannot find anything with which to reciprocate him, then offer supplication for him until you think that you have reciprocated him.” Narrated by Abu Dawud (1672) and an-Nasa’i (2567). Shaykh al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) said: al-Hakim said: It is sahih according to the conditions of the two shaykhs (al-Bukhari and Muslim), and adh-Dhahabi agreed with him. And it is as they said. End quote from as-Silsilah as-Sahihah (1/510).\nIt was narrated from al-Qaasim ibn ‘Abd ar-Rahman, from Abu Umamah, that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever intervenes for his brother and he gives him a gift for that and he accepts it, he has engaged in a major form of riba.” Narrated by Abu Dawud (3541) and Imam Ahmad in al-Musnad (36/588); classed as hasan by al-Albani in as-Silsilah as-Sahihah (7/1371).\nThere is no contradiction between these two hadiths.

The first hadith is when the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does you a favour, then reciprocate him…”\nThe second hadith is: “Whoever intervenes for his brother and he gives him a gift for that and he accepts it, he has engaged in a major form of riba.”\nThis person who intervened for his brother undoubtedly did him a favour, so if he wants to reciprocate him, how can that be regarded as riba? Please advise us, may Allah reward you with good. Can this be understood as referring to when a payment is stipulated or a payment is given for doing that?\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) replied:\nWhat is referred to in this hadith is intervention that is done for the sake of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, so he should not accept payment for it, because that which is done for the hereafter cannot be a means of worldly gain, and because if the one who intervenes for the sake of Allah is given a gift, his desire for worldly gain may overwhelm him in the future, so he may expect some worldly gain for his intervention. Hence the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) warned against accepting gifts [in return for intervening].""(Liqa’ al-Bab al-Maftuh\xa0 83/16).\n-2-\nThe hadith of Abu Umamah (may Allah be pleased with him) may be understood as referring to the kind of intervening that is obligatory, such as intervening to stop oppression or to restore rights that have been taken from someone, and the like.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAs for gifts in return for intervening, such as one who intervenes on behalf of a man with someone in authority, so that some wrong that has been done to him may be put right, or so that he may get what is due to him, or so that he may be appointed to a position of authority that he deserves, or so that he may be accepted to join the troops – when he is qualified for that – or so that he may be granted something from a waqf (endowment) that is allocated to the poor, jurists, reciters of Qur’an, devoted worshippers and so on – when he is deserving of that – and other types of intervention in which the one who intervenes helps to make sure that something obligatory is done or that something prohibited is stopped: in these cases too it is not permissible to accept gifts, but it is permissible for the giver of the gift to give as much as will enable him to get what is rightfully his or to ward off oppression. This is what was narrated from the early generations and the major scholars.\nSome later jurists granted a concession allowing that, and regarded it as coming under the heading of “payment for some service.” But this is contrary to the Sunnah and the views of the Sahabah and senior scholars, so it is wrong, because such actions come under the heading of serving the public interest that one should do as a duty and obligatory act, either as an individual obligation or as a communal obligation.""(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa\xa0 31/287).\nShaykh al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAbu Dawud included this hadith in a chapter entitled: Chapter on gifts given to one who does an errand or helps with something.\nBased on that, I say: if a person has an issue that the one who is intervening is obliged to help his brother with, such as if he wants to intervene for him with the judge in order to relieve him of some wrong that is being done to him, or to help him get what is rightfully his, and similar matters which Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) discussed in detail…\nIt may occur to some people that this hadith contradicts the hadith in which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does you a favour, then reciprocate him, and if you cannot find anything with which to reciprocate him, then offer supplication for him until you think that you have reciprocated him.”\nI say: There is no contradiction, because this is to be understood as referring to issues in which help does not involve intervening, or something that is not obligatory.""(As-Silsilah as-Sahihah\xa0 7/1372).\n-3-\nThe hadith of Abu Umamah is to be understood as referring to all forms of intervention that are aimed at helping others, and this is an exception to the hadith of Ibn ‘Umar.\nAs-San‘ani (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Subul as-Salaam (5/128), commenting on the hadith of Abu Umamah:\nPerhaps what is meant is that if the intervention is concerning something that is obligatory… or is aimed at stopping something that is prohibited… (then it is haram to give a gift).\nIf the intervention has to do with something that is permissible, perhaps it is permissible to accept the gift, because it is by way of reciprocation for a kind action that is not obligatory.\nOr it may be haram, because the intervention is something minor (that does not require much effort), therefore one should not accept a gift in return. End quote.\nSecondly:\nWith regard to your question:\nIf this employee does some work and puts effort into it, then there is nothing wrong with giving him payment or a gift in return for that, because it may be regarded as being in return for the work that he did.\nBut if his work is limited to (verbal) intervention only, and he does not do any other work, then this is a matter concerning which there is a difference of scholarly opinion. The Shafa‘is and Hanbalis allow that, and call it “the price of status.”\nThis has been discussed previously in the answer to question no. 120819 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/309254/the-difference-between-reciprocating-when-someone-does-you-a-favour-and-giving-a-gift-to-one-who-intervened-for-you
67801,"Many Muslims greet their brothers by saying “Salamun `alaykum”. Is it permissible for us to say that? If it is not correct, will the one who does that still be rewarded for saying Salam?.","['Praise be to Allah.Is greeting with Salamun `Alaykum Correct?\nThere is nothing wrong with the person who is initiating the greeting saying, “Salamun `alaykum” or `Salamun `alayka.” Allah tells us that the greeting of the angels to the people of Paradise will be “Salamun `alaykum ” as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And angels shall enter unto them from every gate (saying): `Salamun `Alaykum (peace be upon you) for you persevered in patience! Excellent indeed is the final home!’” [Ar-Ra`d 13:23, 24]\n“And those who kept their duty to their Lord (Al-Muttaqun – the pious) will be led to Paradise in groups till when they reach it, and its gates will be opened (before their arrival for their reception) and its keepers will say: Salamun `Alaykum (peace be upon you)! You have done well, so enter here to abide therein.” [Az-Zumar 39:73]\xa0\nThe Salam in this form is also mentioned in the verse where Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Those whose lives the angels take while they are in a pious state (i.e. pure from all evil, and worshipping none but Allah Alone) saying (to them): Salamun `Alaykum (peace be on you) enter you Paradise, because of that (the good) which you used to do (in the world).” [An-Nahl 16:32]\xa0\n“And when they hear Al-Laghw (dirty, false, evil or vain talk), they withdraw from it and say: `To us our deeds, and to you your deeds. Peace be to you (Salamun `Alaykum). We seek not (the way of) the ignorant.’” [Al-Qasas 28:55]\xa0\n“When those who believe in Our Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) come to you, say: Salamun `Alaykum (peace be on you); your Lord has written (prescribed) Mercy for Himself, so that if any of you does evil in ignorance, and thereafter repents and does righteous good deeds (by obeying Allah), then surely, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” [Al-An`am 6:54]\xa0\nIbn Hibban narrated (493) from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that a man passed by the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when he was in a gathering and said, “Salamun `alaykum.” He (the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)) said, “Ten rewards.” Another man passed by and said, “Salamun `alaykum wa rahmatu-Allahi (Peace be upon you and the mercy of Allah).” He said, “Twenty rewards.” Then another man passed by and said, “Salamun `alaykum wa rahmatu-Allahi wa barakatuhu (Peace be upon you and the mercy of Allah and His blessings).” He said: “Thirty rewards.” A man got up and left the gathering and did not say Salam. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “How soon your companion has forgotten. When one of you comes to a gathering and says Salam, if he wants to sit down then let him do so. Then when he wants to leave, let him say Salam, for the one is not more important than the other.” (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Targhib wal-Tarhib, 2712)\xa0\nThis and other evidence indicates that there is nothing wrong with saying Salam to a person by saying “Salamun `alaykum.”\xa0 He will be rewarded for that, and he deserves a response to his Salam.\xa0\nWhich is better: As-Salamu `alaykum or Salamun `alaykum?\nThe scholars differed as to which version is better, As-Salamu `alaykum or Salamun `alaykum, or whether they are both the same.\xa0\nAl-Mardawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Insaf (2/563): “If a person greets a living person, then the correct view in our Madhhab is that he has the choice between using the definite form (with Al-) or the indefinite (without Al-). And he said: this was stated by more than one.”\nThen he mentioned a report from Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) which says that the definite form is better than the indefinite, and he quoted Ibn `Aqil (may Allah have mercy on him) as saying that the indefinite is better than the definite. \xa0\nAl-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Adhkar (p. 356-358):\xa0\n“Note that it is preferable for the Muslim to say “As-Salamu `alaykum wa rahmatu-Allahi wa barakatuhu”, using the plural pronoun (-kum), even if he is greeting only one person. The respondent should say, “Wa `alaykum As-Salam wa rahmatu-Allahi wa barakatuhu.”\xa0\nOur companions said: If the one who is initiating the greeting says, “As-Salamu `alaykum,” then he has given the greeting. If he said “As-Salamu `alayka” or “Salamun `alayka” this also counts as the greeting.\xa0\nAs for the response, the minimum is to say, `Wa `alayka As-Salam” or “Wa `alaykum As-Salam.” If the waw is omitted and one says, “`Alaykum As-Salam” that is sufficient and is a response.\xa0\nIf the person who is initiating the greeting says “Salamun `alaykum” or “As-Salamu `alaykum,” in both cases the respondent may say, “Salamun `alaykum” , or he may say, “As-Salamu `alaykum”. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“When they came in to him and said: `Salam, (peace be upon you)!’ He answered: `Salam, (peace be upon you)’” [Adh-Dhariyaat 51:25]\nImam Abul Hasan Al-Wahidi (may Allah have mercy on him), one of our companions, said: You have the choice between using the definite form (As-Salam) or the indefinite (Salamun).\xa0\nI (An-Nawawi) say: But the alif and lam are preferable (i.e., saying the word Salam with the definite article Al-).”\xa0\nIs it permissible to initiate the greeting by saying `Alayk As-Salam or `Alaykum As-Salam?\xa0\nWhat is disliked is for the one who is initiating the greeting to say ‘`Alayka As-Salam’ or ‘`Alaykum As-Salam,’ because this is the greeting given to the dead as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said.\xa0\nAbu Dawud (5209) and At-Tirmidhi (2722) narrated that Abu Jurayy Al-Hujaymi (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: “ `Alayka As-Salam (upon you be peace), O Messenger of Allah.” He said, “Do not say ` `Alayka As-Salam’, for `Alayka As-Salam’ is the greeting of the dead.” This Hadith was classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud.\xa0\nWhat is meant by the Prophet’s words “`Alayka As-Salam’ is the greeting of the dead” is the fact that many poets and others greeted the dead in this manner. Moreover the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is to greet the dead in the same manner as he greeted the living, by saying “As-Salamu `alaykum.”\xa0\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said, explaining that:\xa0\n“His greeting, when he was initiating the greeting, was to say, “As-Salamu `alaykum wa rahmatu-Allah”. He did not like the initiator to say “`Alayka’l-Salam.” Abu’l-Jurayy Al-Hujaymi said: I came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: “ `Alayka As-Salam (upon you be peace), O Messenger of Allah.” He said, “Do not say ‘`Alayka As-Salam’, for `Alayka As-Salam’ is the greeting of the dead.” (This Hadith was classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud)\nThis Hadith confused some people, who thought that it contradicted what was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about greeting the dead by saying, “As-Salamu `alaykum,” saying the word Salam first. They thought that his words, “`Alayka As-Salam’ is the greeting of the dead” was describing what is prescribed, but that is a mistake which led them to think that there was a contradiction. Rather what is meant by the words “`Alaykas-Salam’ is the greeting of the dead” is a statement of something that used to happen, not something that was prescribed, namely that the poets and others used to greet the dead in this manner, and he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not like the greeting commonly used for the dead to become widespread.” (Zad Al-Ma`ad, 2/383)\nWhat is the best way to greet someone in Islam?\xa0\nThe most complete form of greeting is to say “As-Salamu `alaykum wa rahmatu-Allahi wa barakatuhu (Peace be upon you and the mercy of Allah and His blessings)” or “Salamun `alaykum wa rahmatu-Allahi wa barakatuhu”, because of the Hadith of Ibn Hibban quoted above, and because of the Hadith narrated by Abu Dawud (5195) and At-Tirmidhi (2689) from `Imran ibn Husayn (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: A man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: “As-Salamu `alaykum,” and he returned the greeting, then he sat down. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Ten.” Then another man came and said, “As-Salamu `alaykum wa rahmatu-Allah,” and he returned the greeting, then he sat down. He said, “Twenty.” Then another man came and said As-Salamu `alaykum wa rahmatu-Allahi wa barakatuhu,” and he returned the greeting, then he sat down. He said, “Thirty.” (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud)\nAs for adding the words “wa maghfiratuhu (and His forgiveness)” or “wa ridwanuhu (and His pleasure)”, these are not mentioned in any authentic report from our Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), as was stated by Ibn Al-Qayyim in Zad Al-Ma`ad (2/381) and by Al-Albani in Da`if Abu Dawud (5196). \xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/67801/is-salamun-alaykum-correct
