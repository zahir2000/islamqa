264354,"is really everything already written down? If yes, then why do we even have free will? What benefit does it have if everything we decide is destiny and we would have decided that anyway. And if there are things we can change by our decisions, does that include death or the worsening of one\'s physical condition? There is a certain someone dear to me and I have to tell him something that he will definitely not accept. I am not sure, I know, that when I tell him either he dies, gets a heart attack or will leave me homeless, alone, without food, water and money. And he won\'t just destroy my entire life, but the ones of many dear people near me too. He is and many other factors are the reason almost everything that I hold dear to me are taken away from me. Including my Lord and my prayer, which is the ultimate and absolute Loss. I have to tell him and stop this madness. The only thing that is still holding me back is the fear of being the reason he died. I only need 1 person. Only one, who finally tells me that he would have died anyway because it is Allah\'s will. But everyone keeps telling me humans have free will, we can change our destiny too, there is a destiny that\'s is changeable by decisions. But wouldn\'t that mean God is not Almighty? No, I just can\'t believe that! Either Allah is almighty and destiny is unchangeable and what people tell me or some things written in the books of Muslim and Bukhari are lies or God is a lie. And I refuse to believe the second","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nEverything in this world, whatever was and whatever will be, Allah, may He be exalted has decreed it in the record with Him; He knew it and He willed it to happen. This is al-qadar (the divine decree) with its four stages: writing, knowledge, willing, then creating it and bringing it into existence.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Indeed, all things We created with predestination}\xa0[al-Qamar 54:49]\n{And with Him are the keys of the unseen; none knows them except Him. And He knows what is on the land and in the sea. Not a leaf falls but that He knows it. And no grain is there within the darknesses of the earth and no moist or dry [thing] but that it is [written] in a clear record}\xa0[al-An‘am 6:59]\n{No disaster strikes upon the earth or among yourselves except that it is in a register before We bring it into being - indeed that, for Allah, is easy}\xa0[al-Hadid 57:22]\n{And you do not will except that Allah wills - Lord of the worlds}\xa0[at-Takwir 81:29].\nMuslim (2653) narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘As said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “Allah decided the decrees of creation fifty thousand years before He created the heavens and the earth. He said: And His Throne was [already] above the water.”\nSecondly:\nThis divine decree cannot be changed, in the sense that if Allah has decreed that So-and-so will die as a believer or as a disbeliever, or that he will live a happy or wretched life, or he will be blessed with ten children, for example, that cannot be changed, because if it were possible to change it, that would be casting aspersions upon the knowledge, will and might of Allah. Rather whatever Allah wills happens and whatever He does not will does not happen.\nIn the hadith of Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) it says: I was behind the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) on a mount one day and he said: “O boy, I shall teach you some words. Be mindful of Allah and He will take care of you. Be mindful of Allah and He will protect you. If you ask then ask of Allah, and if you seek help then seek help from Allah. Know that if the nation were to gather together to benefit you in some way, they would not benefit you except in something that Allah has already decreed for you, and if they were to gather together to harm you in some way, they would not harm you except in something that Allah has already decreed for you. The pens have been lifted and the pages have dried.” Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Tirmidhi.\xa0\nBut there is another aspect of the divine decree, which is the writing of decrees concerning people, in the records that are in the hands of the angels.\nIn the hadith of ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud (may Allah be pleased with him) it says: “The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), who is the most truthful one, told us: “The creation of any one of you is put together in his mother’s womb for forty days, then he becomes a ‘alaqah (a clinging clot) for a similar period, then he becomes a mudghah (lump of flesh) for a similar period, then Allah sends to him an angel who breathes the soul into him and is instructed to write down four things: his provision, his lifespan, his deeds and whether he is doomed (to Hell) or blessed (destined for Paradise)..” Narrated by al-Bukhari (3208) and Muslim (2643).\nThis is something that may be regarded as the decree that could be changed; it is a change to this decree that is written in the records of the angels only, such as if it is written therein that So-and-so will fall sick, then he offers supplication, so Allah grants him well-being and he does not fall sick.\nOr it is written that he will live for sixty years, but he upholds ties of kinship, so his lifespan is extended to seventy years.\nThis is a change to what is written in the records of the angels, and it is possible; it is not impossible that that could happen.\nThis is not changing what is written in al-Lawh al-Mahfooz, or changing what Allah knows, for Allah, may He be exalted, knew that he would do that, so He granted him well-being or increased his lifespan. These two aspects mean that there can be no change to what is written in al-Lawh al-Mahfooz and what Allah knows, as explained above.\nAs for changes in what is written in the records that are in the hands of the angels, this is proven and is not impossible. This is indicated by the hadith of Salman (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Nothing can put back the decree of Allah except supplication, and nothing can extend a person’s lifespan except righteous deeds and kindness to others.” Narrated by at-Tirmidhi (2139); classed as hasan by al-Albani. It was also narrated by Ahmad (22386) and Ibn Majah, from Thawban, as: “Nothing can put back the divine decree except supplication.” Classed as hasan by al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah.\nPlease see the answer to question no. 43021 .\nThirdly:\nThere is no contradiction between the fact that things are decreed and written, and the fact that we have free will when doing them, for we do not know what is written and we feel that we have complete freedom to choose what actions to take, and we distinguish between involuntary actions such as the heartbeat and the activity of the intestines, and voluntary actions that we do with our hands or feet or eyes and so on.\nHence man is accountable for his actions, because he does them by choice, so he has the ability to do good just as he has the ability to do evil. He has no right to argue that it is already decreed for him, because he does not know what is written and decreed until after it happens, and he does not know how things will end up. It may be decreed that after he commits a sin, for example, he will call upon Allah in supplication and seek His forgiveness, so Allah will turn to him in mercy, and he will mend his ways and follow the path of righteousness, and so on. Hence when the Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) asked: Should we not rely on what is written and give up striving?\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) answered them by saying: “Strive, for each person will be enabled to do that for which he was created. As for those who are among the blessed, they will be enabled to do the deeds of the blessed; as for those who are among the doomed, they will be enabled to do the deeds of the doomed.” Then he recited the words:\n{As for he who gives and fears Allah,\nAnd believes in the best [reward],\nWe will ease him toward ease.\nBut as for he who withholds and considers himself free of need,\nAnd denies the best [reward],\nWe will ease him toward difficulty}\xa0[al-Layl 92:5-10].\nAll man has to do in this life is strive hard, without trying to find out, Is this written for me or not? For he will never find out. Rather it is sufficient for him to strive and do deeds of righteousness, and do the deeds of the people of Paradise, for Paradise can only be attained through striving, and the dwellings of the people of Paradise can only be reached by means of striving, not by means of wishful thinking.\nIf the issue of the divine decree having already been written is worrying someone, he should realise that Allah has decreed for him that he should strive in doing acts of worship and righteous deeds, and not do the deeds of the people of Hell. In other words, that is required of him, prescribed for him and enjoined on him, and this should be sufficient motivation to strive and do righteous deeds.\nAs for knowing that everything is already decreed, this brings peace of mind when calamity strikes, so he should not despair or say, “If only I had done such and such, then such and such would have happened.” This is what is meant by the verses in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{ No disaster strikes upon the earth or among yourselves except that it is in a register before We bring it into being - indeed that, for Allah, is easy.\n57:23\xa0 In order that you not despair over what has eluded you and not exult [in pride] over what He has given you. And Allah does not like everyone self-deluded and boastful}\xa0[al-Hadid 57:22-23].\nFourthly:\nAs for what you have asked about with regard to your companion, the response is that his lifespan is already decreed and is known to Allah, may He be exalted, and that cannot change. But things are decreed with their causes, and it may be decreed that he will die when he hears some news from So-and-so, or he may die of some disease, or he may die by being killed, or in a fire, and so on. That will unfold as decreed.\nHence we repeat: there is no point in searching for what has been decreed. You should not be seeking to discover what has been divinely decreed; rather you should seek to learn about Islamic teachings and ask: Is it permissible for me to tell him something that could lead to his death, or could result in harm to him or to me?\nThese questions cannot be answered without knowing the nature of what you would tell him, and the nature of his connection to that person. Perhaps the question has to do with a sin that he must be warned against, or about something that you cannot keep quiet about. For example, if we assume that a man has been married for many years to a woman whom he loves very much, but it turns out that she is not permissible for him, because she is his sister or aunt through breastfeeding; in that case we have no choice but to inform him of that, because his staying with her would mean that he is falling into zina.\nIf telling him is likely to lead to his death, if it is possible to avoid the forbidden action without telling him at the moment, out of fear for his life, there is nothing wrong with that, such as if the woman were to travel, or some other means.\nThe point is that each matter that you have mentioned should be presented on its own to people of knowledge who can examine the issue and then decide whether it is necessary to tell him, or it is possible to delay telling him, or it is not required at all.\nWe ask Allah to help and guide us and you.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/264354/how-can-we-have-free-will-when-the-divine-decree-controls-us
273235,"There is something that is worrying me, and I do not know the ruling on it. I am a young man and I have a shop for repairing household appliances, mostly fridges, washing machines and air conditioning units. The place where I work is not big, and often I end up with a lot of fridges and washing machines whose owners don’t come to collect them, and don’t want them to be fixed. I wait, sometimes for a year, sometimes for two years, and they do not come, then because the place is full and there is no room to receive the appliances whose owners want them to be fixed, I have no choice but to dismantle them and throw them away. Sometimes I leave them outside the shop for a month or more, and they do not come to collect them, so I throw them away. Sometimes I take parts from them, if they are good enough to use. After more than a year or two, some of them come to ask about their appliances, and I tell them that were it not that I was forced to throw them away because the place is too small, I would not have thrown them away. Some of them accept the situation, and some of them say to me: I will not forgive that; I want my appliance. Sometimes, when I know where the owner of the broken appliance lives, who did not ask about it for a year, I even rent a truck at my own expense to deliver it to their houses for them. But sometimes, I do not know who the owner is, because they leave the appliances outside the shop and I find them, and keep them for more than six months, then if the owner does not show up, I throw them away. I want to know the Islamic ruling on my situation. Are the appliances that I throw away regarded as a trust that has been left with me, and is it not permissible to dispose of them? If the answer is yes, then is there a particular length of time for which I should keep them? If it is not permissible, then please tell me and advise me, because I am confused, and I do not want to incur the wrath of Allah, may He be exalted, or be one of those who consume people’s wealth unlawfully.","['Praise be to Allah.The appliances that the owners bring to you to fix are regarded as a trust that is left with you, and you must keep them and look after them until their owners come to collect them.\nBut if the owner of the appliance is later than usual in coming to collect his appliance after you have fixed it, and you have lost hope that he will return, or his leaving the appliance is detrimental to your business because you do not have much room, or because it is difficult to keep them and alike:\nin this case you have the right, on the grounds of warding off harm from yourself, to sell these appliances at the market price, and take from that your fee as agreed upon with the customer, and set the rest of that money aside. Then if the owner comes along some day, you can give the remaining money back to him.\nThe fatwa committee of the al-Fiqh al-Islami (Islamic jurisprudence) website said: He must wait for the length of time after which he thinks it most likely that the owner will never come back to collect it, then he may dispose of it and take in full his fee, and the rent for the place according to custom or agreement, then if anything is left it belongs to the owner; if he shows up he should give it back to him, and if he does not show up, it is permissible for him to make use of it, but he remains liable for replacing it, and if he keeps it [without making use of it] to be on the safe side, that is better.\nThis is what he must do on the basis of the general Islamic principle that harm must be removed. It is well known that keeping these items in the shop and not receiving any fee for his work causes great harm to the owner of the workshop or laundry service, especially if he needs parts and the like, and he also needs to pay his workers’ wages and rent for the shop, and he may be forced to turn away other work because he does not have space to store the items.\nThe matter is exacerbated if this happens repeatedly with more than one customer. All of that causes serious harm to the owner of the shop, and it justifies his disposing of these items by selling them.\nOur advice to you is:\nYou should put a clause in the contract, or write it on a piece of paper that you post in a prominent place in your shop, so that the customers can see it, stating that appliances will be disposed of after a certain period that you think is appropriate to both parties, if the owners do not come to collect them.\nAfter the end of that period, you are not obliged to keep them, and it is permissible for you to dispose of them by selling them, then taking your fee and giving the rest of the money in charity, or by giving them in charity as is, or getting rid of them if they are not fit to give in charity or sell.\nBut it would be better to write down the phone number, contact details or email of the owner of each appliance, and the date you received the appliance, then before the end of that period, you can contact him to warn him that you are not responsible for his appliance if he does not come and collect it. If he does come and collect it, all well and good, otherwise you may dispose of it as explained above.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/273235/what-should-owners-of-repair-shops-do-with-appliances-whose-owners-leave-them-there-for-a-long-time
