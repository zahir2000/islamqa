257088,"Are artificial false lashes haraam? How do they fall under the ruling of extensions when they are not hair on your head and mascara is allowed which also lengthens? Also, we are allowed to dye and use black cosmetics on our eyelashes and not our hair so surely they fall under different categories. As for deception, in this case wouldn't all makeup be deception not just lashes?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nFalse eyelashes are used in two scenarios:\nThe first scenario is when they are worn to correct a deformity resulting from sickness or burns. This does not come under the heading of cosmetic procedures that are haram; rather it comes under the heading of remediating a defect.\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) gave permission [to one of his companions] to wear a nose made of gold, and he gave permission to change it [from a previous one made of silver] because it was by way of correcting a defect.\nAbu Dawud (4232), at-Tirmidhi (1770) and an-Nasa’i (5161) narrated from ‘Abd ar-Rahman ibn Tarafah that his grandfather ‘Arfajah ibn As‘ad had his nose cut off in the battle of al-Kulaab, and he wore a nose made of silver, but it began to stink, so the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) told him to get a nose made of gold. This hadith was classed as hasan by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud.\nAbu Dawud (4170) narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas said: The woman who does hair extensions and the woman for whom that is done, the woman who plucks eyebrows and the woman for whom that is done, the woman who does tattoos and the woman for whom that is done when there is no ailment (that would justify doing those things) are cursed.\nAhmad (3945) narrated that Ibn Mas‘ud said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbid plucking eyebrows, filing teeth, adding hair extensions and doing tattoos, except in the case of ailments.\nAsh-Shawkani (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The apparent meaning of the phrase “except in the case of ailments” indicates that the prohibition mentioned only applies in cases where these things are done for the purpose of beautification, and not as a remedy for an ailment or problem, in which case they are not haram.""(Nayl al-Awtar\xa0 6/229).\nThe second scenario is when the eyelashes are already there, and the false eyelashes are only worn for cosmetic reasons and enhancing beauty. This is forbidden for two reasons:\nFirstly: because that comes under the heading of hair extensions, which are prohibited.\nSecondly: because of the harm that results from applying these false eyelashes.\nIt says in Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa’imah (17/133): It is not permissible to use artificial nails, artificial eyelashes and coloured contact lenses, because of what that involves of causing harm to the place where these things are applied to the body, and because it also comes under the heading of deceit, trickery and changing the creation of Allah. End quote.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: What is the ruling on wearing false eyelashes for the purpose of beautifying oneself for one’s husband?\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) replied: False eyelashes are not permissible, because they are akin to hair extensions, which means adding to the hair on the head. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) cursed the woman who does hair extensions and the woman for whom that is done.\nIf these false eyelashes are as I imagine them to be now, where black threads like hair are placed on the eyelashes so that it looks as if they are thicker, to make the eyes look beautiful, then if that is the case, they come under the heading of hair extensions, concerning which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) cursed the woman who does that for the hair on her head.\nBut if what is meant is colouring the natural eyelashes (mascara), then it is not haram.""(Fatawa Nur ‘ala ad-Darb).\nShaykh Ibn Jibrin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: There are false eyelashes which are applied along the edge of the entire eyelid for those whose eyelashes are short, or they may be applied to part of the edge of the eyelid in areas where the lashes are short, and they are removed after the event, like any other kind of makeup. What is the ruling on that? Please advise us, may Allah reward you.\nHe replied: Eyelashes are the hair along the eyelids, which Allah, may He be exalted, has created to protect the eyes from dust and dirt. Hence the eyelashes are present from birth, and they are also found in most animals. They are hairs that are of a fixed length, and grow neither long nor short. If the eyelash is plucked, it grows back, but some people may feel pain in the eyelashes and need to pluck this area in order to reduce the pain.\nIf that is the case, then I think that it is not permissible to wear false eyelashes, because it comes under the heading of hair extensions. It is proven that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) cursed the woman who does hair extensions and the one who asks for that to be done. As he forbade adding extensions to the hair of the head, the same applies to the eyelashes. It is not permissible to add extensions to the eyelashes or to wear false eyelashes because the original eyelashes are short. Rather the woman should accept what Allah has decreed, and not do anything that involves deceit or fake beauty, for the one who pretends to have something that he does not have is like the one who wears two garments of falsehood. And Allah knows best.""(‘Ulama’ al-Balad al-Haram, p. 1209).\nDr. Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-‘Aziz al-Musnid said in his book Zinat al-Mar’ah bayna at-Tibb wa’sh-Shar‘ (p. 33): As for false eyelashes and substances that are used on the false eyelashes, doctors say that they are composed of nickel salts or some types of artificial rubber, which may cause infection of the eyelids and lead to loss of the eyelashes. End quote.\nThese false eyelashes are also not allowed for a third reason, which is deceit and trickery if they are worn for anyone other than the husband. In that case, they are the same as all other forms of deceit, even dyeing the hair.\nSecondly:\nWith regard to what the questioner mentioned about there being a difference between eyelashes and the hair on the head, in reality there is no difference between them, because it is permissible to use kohl on the eyelashes, which makes them grow longer, just as it is permissible to use henna, oils and olive oil on the hair on one’s head to make it grow long.\nDyeing the hair black it is only forbidden in the case of grey hair; it is not forbidden if there is no issue of grey hair.\nMost of the scholars say that false eyelashes come under the ruling on hair extensions. Some of them say that they are the same as hair extensions, and some of them say that they are akin to hair extensions, therefore they are subject to the same ruling. If we assume that the mention of hair extensions in the hadith refers to the hair on the head, then false eyelashes come under the same ruling by analogy with the hair.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/257088/false-eyelashes-come-under-the-same-ruling-as-hair-extensions
20325,We know from Hadith that the Angels do not enter into a house where pictures/photographs of living things (humans or animals) are displaced.,"[""Praise be to Allah.Types of image-making\nImage-making is of two types: one by hand and the other by means of machines.\xa0\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Image-making by hand is prohibited , and is in fact a major sin, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed the one who does it. He did not differentiate between images that have a shadow (i.e., three-dimensional) or those that are simply drawn (two-dimensional), according to the more correct scholarly opinion, because of the general meaning of the Hadith. \xa0\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 With regard to image-making by means of machines, i.e. cameras, there is a difference of opinion among the later scholars on this matter. Some of them forbid it and some of them allow it.\xa0\nIn order to be on the safe side, it is better to avoid that, because it is one of the doubtful areas. And whoever is careful with regard to doubtful matters will protect his religious commitment and his honour. But if he needs to do that for a specific purpose such as proving his identity, there is nothing wrong with that because if there is a need, the matter is no longer doubtful.\n\xa0Is keeping pictures prohibited in Islam?\xa0\nWith regard to keeping pictures , this is also of two types:\xa0\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The first type is keeping images that are three-dimensional. Keeping them is prohibited. Ibn Al-`Arabi (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated that there is consensus on this point. (See Fath Al-Bari, p. 388, vol. 10) He said: This consensus has to do with things other than girls’ dolls.\xa0\nIt was narrated that `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “I used to play with dolls in the presence of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and I had friends who would play with me. When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) entered they would hide themselves and he would call them to come and play with me.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, no. 5779; Muslim, no. 2440)\xa0\n·\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The second type is images that are not three-dimensional. These are of different types:\xa0\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Those that are hung up to be venerated and respected , as in the case of pictures of kings, presidents, ministers, scholars etc. This is prohibited because it involves exaggeration about a created being.\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Those that are hung up for the sake of memory , such as hanging up pictures of one's friends. This is also prohibited, because of the Hadith narrated by Al-Bukhari from Abu Talhah (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: “I heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: `The angels do not enter any house in which there is a dog or an image.’” (Narrated by Muslim, 2104).\n3.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Those that are hung up for the purpose of adornment. These are also prohibited because of the Hadith of `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came back from a journey and I had hung a patterned curtain on which there were images over (the door of) a room of mine. When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw it, he tore it and said, `The most severely punished of the people on the Day of Resurrection will be those who tried to imitate the creation of Allah.’” She said: “So I made it into one or two cushions.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 5610; Muslim, 2107)\n4.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Those that are treated with disrespect, such as images in carpets and pillows. Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated from the majority of scholars among the Companions and Tabi’in that these are permissible.\n5.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Those that have unfortunately become widespread and are difficult to avoid, such as images engraved on coins etc which have become a problem for the Muslim ummah. It seems to me that there is no sin on the one who acquires these without wanting to acquire images.\nIs keeping children’s toys prohibited?\nAn exception is made in the case of children’s toys, which are not regarded as prohibited or disliked. But what are the toys which are exempted? We know that the toys of the past did not have eyes and lips and noses as they do nowadays. I think it is better to avoid these toys and limit oneself to those the kind of toys that were known previously.\xa0(See Fatawa Al-`Aqidah by Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin, p. 66, 663, 679)\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20325/is-keeping-pictures-prohibited-in-islam
129888,"I read some hadiths about the formation of the foetus, which Ibn al-Qayyim quoted in his book at-Tibyan fi Aqsam al-Quran. He said that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If the man’s water precedes the woman’s water, the foetus will be male, and if the woman’s water precedes the man’s water, then the foetus will be female…” Then he quoted another hadith, according to which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was asked from what man is created, and he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) replied: “From the water of the man and the woman together. From the man’s water the bones and sinews are created because it is thick and from the woman’s water the blood and flesh are created because it is soft.” Can you explain this idea in the light of these two hadiths?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe second hadith quoted in the question is not sahih. Its wording, and the views of leading scholars concerning it, follow:\nIt was narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: A Jewish man passed by the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) when he was talking to his companions. Quraysh said: O Jew, this man claims that he is a prophet. The Jewish man said: I shall ask him about something which no one knows except a prophet. So he came and sat down, then he said: O Muhammad, from what is man created? He said: “O Jew, [he is created] from both, from the water of the man and the water of the woman. As for the water of the man, it is thick and from it [come] the bones and sinews; as for the water of the woman, it is thin and from it [come] the flesh and blood.” The Jewish man stood up and said: This is what those who came before you said.\nNarrated by Ahmad in his Musnad (7/437).\nShaykh Ahmad Shakir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIts isnad is weak (da‘if), because of the weakness of Husayn ibn al-Hasan, who is al-Ashqar. The hadith is in Majma‘ az-Zawa’id (8/241). And he said: It was narrated by Ahmad, at-Tabarani and al-Bazzar with two isnads. One of its isnads includes ‘Amir ibn Mudrik, whom Ibn Hibban regarded as trustworthy (thiqah), but others regarded him as weak. The rest of its narrators are trustworthy. The isnad of the group includes ‘Ata’ ibn as-Sa’ib, who at some point became confused and forgetful.\nMusnad Ahmad, annotated by Shaykh Ahmad Shakir (6/199).\nIt was also classed as weak by the commentators on al-Musnad (7/437, ar-Risalah edn.), who said:\nIts isnad is weak (da‘if) because of the weakness of Husayn ibn al-Hasan, who is al-Ashqar, and ‘Ata ibn as-Sa’ib, who became confused and forgetful at the end of his life. We have not come across anything to indicate whether Abu Kudaynah – who is Yahya ibn al-Muhallab – heard it from him before or after he became confused. Regarding ‘Abd ar-Rahman, the father of al-Qasim – who is the son of ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud – it is not proven that he heard this hadith from his father, because he only heard a few hadiths from his father. End quote.\nIn addition to the isnad of this hadith being weak (da’if), there is also a problem with its text, as it says that the flesh of the foetus is formed from the water of the mother and its bones are formed from the water of the father. The apparent meaning of the religious texts is that the flesh and bones are formed from both waters together.\nThe commentators on al-Musnad narrated from Nur ad-Din Abu’l-Hasan as-Sindi (may Allah have mercy on him) that he said:\nRegarding the words “as for the water of the woman, it is thin and from it [come] the flesh and blood,” I say: The apparent meaning of the Quran – namely the verse (interpretation of the meaning): {Then We made the sperm-drop into a clinging clot, and We made the clot into a lump [of flesh], and We made [from] the lump, bones, and We covered the bones with flesh; then We developed him into another creation} [al-Mu’minun 23:14] – indicates that the two waters together become bones. End quote.\nSecondly: Regarding the creation of the foetus, whether it will be male or female, and whether it will resemble the father or the mother, all of these are issues for which there are indications in the Quran and Sunnah, and there is a difference of scholarly opinion regarding that. We may outline it in brief as follows:\n-1-\nCreation of the foetus\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{So let man observe from what he was created.\nHe was created from a fluid, ejected,\nEmerging from between the backbone and the ribs}\xa0[At-Tariq 86:5-7].\nThe scholars differed regarding the meaning of this verse. We have discussed their difference of opinion in the answer to question no. 118879 .\nWe think that what is most likely to be correct is the view of a group of commentators and scholars who said that the “backbone (as-sulb)” – which is the spine – and the “ribs (at-tara’ib)” – which are the bones of the chest – refer to the man himself.\n-2-\nBecoming male or female, and resembling either parent\nThere is a great deal of dispute among earlier and contemporary scholars regarding this matter. We will quote a number of hadiths which speak of the issue, then we will quote the most famous comments of the scholars regarding them.\ni.\nIt was narrated from Anas that ‘Abdullah ibn Salam asked the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): Why does the child resemble its father or its mother? The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Jibril has informed me of that just now. As for the child, if the man’s water precedes the woman’s water, the child will resemble him, but if the woman’s water precedes the man’s water, the child will resemble her.” ‘Abdullah ibn Salam said: I bear witness that there is no god worthy of worship except Allah and that you are the Messenger of Allah. Narrated by al-Bukhari (3723).\nWhat is meant by “resemble him” is that he will look like him.\nii.\nIt was narrated that Thawban, the freed slave of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: I was standing beside the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) when one of the Jewish rabbis came and said: I have come to ask you about the child. He said: “The water of the man is white and the water of the woman is yellow.\xa0 If they meet and the water of the man prevails over the water of the woman, it will be a male, by Allah\'s leave. If the water of the woman prevails over the water of the man, it will be a female, by Allah’s leave.” The Jew said: You have spoken the truth. Narrated by Muslim (315).\niii.\nIt was narrated from Umm Sulaym that she asked the Prophet of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) about a woman who sees in her dreams what a man sees (that, an erotic dream). The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If a woman sees that (that is, wetness), let her do ghusl.” Umm Salamah said: I felt shy because of that and I said: Does that really happen? The Prophet of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “How else does resemblance (of the child to either parent) happen? The water of the man is thick and white, and the water of the woman is thin and yellow. Whichever of them prevails, or comes first, the resemblance will be (to that parent).” Narrated by Muslim (311).\niv.\nIt was narrated from ‘A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that a woman said to the Messenger of Allah: Should a woman do ghusl if she has an erotic dream and sees water? He said: “Yes… Can the resemblance (of the child to either parent) come except through that? If her water prevails over that of the man, then the child will resemble his maternal uncles, and if the man’s water prevails over hers, then he will resemble his paternal uncles.” Narrated by Muslim (314).\nHere we will quote two scholarly views regarding the meaning of the hadiths quoted above, and the salient point here is the meaning of the words “precedes/comes before” and “prevails.”\n-a-\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf one of the two waters comes before the other, that will cause the child to resemble the parent whose water comes first. If one of the two waters prevails over the other, that will cause the child to be of the same gender as the parent whose water prevailed. So here we have two issues: preceding or coming before, and prevailing. Both may happen for one parent, or one will happen for one parent and the other will happen for the other parent. If the water of the man precedes the water of the woman and prevails over it, then the child will be male and will resemble the father. If the water of the woman precedes the water of the man and prevails over it, then the child will female and will resemble the mother. If one of them comes first and the other prevails, then the child will resemble the parent whose water came first, and will be male or female according to which parent’s water prevails.""(Tuhfat al-Mawdud bi Ahkam al-Mawlud\xa0 p. 278).\n-b-\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nMuslim narrated from ‘A’ishah: “If the man’s water prevails over the woman’s water, the child will resemble his paternal uncles, and if the woman’s water prevails over the man’s water, the child will resemble his maternal uncles.” A similar report was narrated by al-Bazzar from Ibn Mas‘ud, in which it says: “The man’s water is white and thick and the woman’s water is yellow and thin. Whichever of them prevails, the child will resemble that parent.” What is meant by prevailing is coming first, because everything which comes first becomes dominant, so it prevails in a metaphoric sense.\nAs for what was narrated by Muslim in the marfu‘ hadith of Thawban, that “The water of the man is white and the water of the woman is yellow.\xa0 If they meet and the water of the man prevails over the maniy of the woman, it will be a male, by Allah\'s leave. If the water of the woman prevails over the maniy of the man, it will be a female, by Allah’s leave,” there is a problem with this report, which is that it implies that the child will inevitably resemble the paternal uncles if the father’s water prevails, and the same time the child will be male and not female, and vice versa. But what we see in real life is different, because the child may be male and resemble his maternal uncles, not his paternal uncles, and vice versa. Al-Qurtubi said: We must understand the hadith of Thawban on the basis that what is meant by prevailing is coming first. I say: What appears to be the case is what I noted above, which is that we may interpret prevailing as mentioned in the hadith of ‘A’ishah in a different way. As for the hadith of Thawban, prevailing may be understood in accordance with its apparent meaning, so preceding or coming first is what will determine whether the child is male or female, and prevailing is what will determine whether the child resembles the mother or the father. Thus the problem is resolved. It is as if what is meant by that prevailing which determines who the child resembles is being greater in size and volume, so that the water of the other one is overwhelmed and absorbed, and this determines who the child resembles. That may be divided into six categories:\n\nWhen the man’s water comes first and is greater in quantity, so the child will be male and resemble the father.\nThe opposite of that.\nWhen the man’s water comes first, but the woman’s water is greater in quantity, so the child will be male but will resemble the mother.\nThe opposite of that.\nWhen the man’s water comes first, but the two waters are equal in volume, so the child will be male, but will not resemble either parent.\nThe opposite of that.\n\nFath al-Bari (7/273).\nTo sum up the above:\n\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said, explaining the meaning of “coming first/preceding” and “prevailing” that whichever of the two waters comes first, the child will resemble the parent whose water comes first, and the prevailing of one of them will determine whether the child is male or female.\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) was of the view that whichever water comes first determines whether the child will be male or female, and whichever prevails determines who the child resembles.\n\nThe matter is open to possibilities. Perhaps modern medical facts – not theories – will lend support to one of the two views. You can refer to specialist books on the topic for more information.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/129888/questions-regarding-how-the-foetus-is-created-what-leads-to-it-being-male-or-female-and-what-leads-to-it-resembling-the-father-or-the-mother
47889,Is there a set limit to a trader’s profits?,"['Praise be to Allah.There is no set limit to which a trader must adhere in the profits he makes on his business, but if the goods have a known market value, it is not permissible for him to cheat the buyer by selling goods to him for more than the usual market value and taking advantage of his ignorance.\xa0\nThis is indicated by the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Do not meet incoming traders and whoever meets them and buys from them, when the trader reaches the marketplace he has the choice (of annulling the transaction).” (Narrated by Muslim, 1519)\xa0\nIslam gives the trader the choice, when he reaches the marketplace, because the one who met him probably cheated him and bought from him at a price other than the market value. If he finds that this is the case, then he may either go ahead with the deal, or cancel it.\xa0\nThe point in this Hadith is that it is forbidden to meet those traders on the way because of the deceit involved and because they are not being given the proper market price.\xa0\nThe Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas was asked: Are profits limited in Islam, and if that is the case, what is the highest limit? If there is no limit, how do you explain that?\xa0\nThey replied:\n“There is no limit to profits in trading , rather the matter is subject to supply and demand. But it is good for the Muslim, whether he is a trader or not, to be easy going in buying and selling, and not to exploit the opportunity of his counterpart’s carelessness to cheat him in buying and selling.

It is prescribed for the Muslim not to go to extremes in seeking profits but rather to be easy going when he buys and when he sells, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) urged forbearance in all dealings.” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 13/92)\nFor more details, please refer t o the following answers: 13973 and 97599 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/47889/how-much-profit-is-allowed-in-islam
