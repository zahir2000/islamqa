174681,There is a hadith which says that young people are sparks of fire; either they pave the way or they burn it. I hope you can explain how sound this hadith is.,"['Praise be to Allah.We have not come across this hadith with this text, or even something close in meaning. It is strange that this hadith is narrated on some English-language Islamic websites and attributed to “al-Tirmidhi.” We do not know who is meant by that: is it Abu ‘Isa al-Tirmidhi, the author of al-Sunan (d. 279 AH), or al-Hakim al-Tirmidhi (d. 320 AH), the author of Nawadir al-Usul? Whatever the case, we did not find this hadith in either of their books. What is required of the Muslim is to verify a report before narrating it, and it is not permissible for him to attribute hadiths to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) before checking whether they are authentic.\nAs for the impact that youth have on the life of communities, it is great and important, because they are the foundation and basis on which the community is built, and they are the main players in different aspects of life, the ones who lead society to progress or regress. We ask Allah to guide the Muslim youth to be torches of light, guidance, success and prosperity.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/174681/young-people-are-sparks-of-fire-is-not-a-hadith
240287,The individual should keep his intention in mind and correct it before doing any deed; how can he do that? What are the standards and guidelines to know whether what you are doing is correct and sincerely for the sake of Allah alone?,"['Praise be to Allah.Correcting one’s intention\xa0\nCorrecting one’s intention , and bearing it in mind when starting to do the deed, is one of the most important things a Muslim should focus on, for the acceptance or rejection of one’s deeds is based on that, as is the soundness or corruption of the heart.\nThe one who wants to form a sound intention for his deeds must pay attention to the motive that is prompting him to do that deed, and he should be keen to ensure that his motive is seeking the pleasure of Allah , may He be Exalted, and obeying Him and complying with His commands.\nBy doing that, his intention will be for Allah. After that, he must maintain this original motive for doing the deed that is sincerely for the sake of Allah. He should not be distracted from that whilst doing the deed, and ensure that his heart and his intention do not change, or become diverted to something other than Allah, or associate anything else with his intention.\nHow to achieve sincerity in your deeds\nOne can find out whether he is being sincere in his deed, and whether he is striving only for the sake of Allah, by paying attention to the following:\n\nHe should not do that deed so that other people can see him or hear about him .\n\nAl-Bukhari (6499) and Muslim (2987) narrated that Jundub (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever talks about his good deeds (to show off), Allah will expose him (on the Day of Resurrection), and whoever makes a (hypocritical) display, Allah will make a display of him.”\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Al-Khattabi said: What this means is that whoever does a deed that is not sincere (for the sake of Allah), rather he wants people to see him and to hear about him, will be recompensed for that by Allah exposing and disgracing him, and will make known what he used to conceal.\nAnd it was said: whoever intends by his deed to seek high status among people, and does not intend it for the sake of Allah, Allah will cause him to be talked about among those with whom he sought to attain high status, but there will be no reward for him in the hereafter."" (Fath Al-Bari 11/336)\nAl-‘Izz ibn ‘Abd As-Salam (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Exceptions from the recommendation to conceal one’s good deeds include: one who does his good deed openly so that his example may be followed, or so that people may benefit from it, such as writing books of knowledge."" (Fath Al-Bari\xa0 11/337).\n\nHe should not concern himself with people’s praise or criticism.\n\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n‘When a person reaches a high level of devotion to his Lord and becomes steadfast in that, he will rise above being concerned with people’s praise and criticism, and he will not rejoice when people praise him or be upset when they criticise him. This is the description of one who is not swayed by his whims and desires and has attained true servitude to his Lord, and whose heart has tasted the sweetness of faith and certainty."" (Madarij As-Salikin\xa0 2/8)\n\nConcealing his good deeds and keeping them secret should be dearer to him than doing them openly.\n\nIt was narrated that ‘Asim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “When Abu Wa’il prayed in his house, he would sob greatly and he would not do that in a place where people could see him, even if he were to be offered the entire world in return for anyone seeing what he did.”\nNarrated by Ahmad in Az-Zuhd (p. 290).\n\nHe should be keen to avoid situations where he could become prominent and famous, unless that serves a legitimate Shar`i interest.\n\nIbrahim ibn Adham (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “He is not sincere towards Allah who wants to become famous."" (Ihya’ ‘Ulum Ad-Din\xa0 3/297).\n\nHe should not increase his good deeds and make them perform them in a better manner when people are around him.\n\nIt was said that sincerity means that a person’s deeds are the same whether they are done openly or privately.\nShowing off occurs when the deeds one does openly are better than those that are done privately.""(Madarij As-Salikin\xa0 2/91).\n\nHe should always think of himself as falling short, and should not attribute any good deeds to himself, and he should realise that all blessings come from Allah, and were it not for Allah, may He be Exalted, he would be doomed.\n\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And if not for the favour of Allah upon you and His mercy, not one of you would have been pure, ever, but Allah purifies whom He wills”\xa0[An-Nur 24:21]\n\nHe should pray a great deal for forgiveness (Istighfar ) after doing the deed, and should feel that he has fallen short.\n\nAs-Sa‘di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n‘Every time a person finishes an act of worship, he should seek Allah’s forgiveness for his shortcomings, and thank Him for enabling him to do it. He should not be like one who thinks that he has perfected his acts of worship and done a favour to his Lord, and think that it has given him a high status, for such a person deserves rejected and for his deed not to be accepted, just as the former deserves to be accepted and enabled to do more deeds."" (Tafsir As-Sa‘di\xa0 p. 92)\n\nHe should rejoice when Allah enables him to do righteous deeds.\n\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Say, in the bounty of Allah and in His mercy - in that let them rejoice; it is better than what they accumulate”\xa0[Yunus 10:58]\nIf a person pays attention to these matters with regard to his deeds, then there is the hope that he will be one of the sincere.\nCan you be certain that you are sincere in your deeds?\nAs for being certain that one is sincere in his deeds, there is no way to verify that, because the knowledge of that is with Allah alone. But the individual should take measures to attain sincerity, and ask Allah, may He be Exalted, to enable him to do his deeds in an appropriate and sincere manner, but he should not affirm that he or anyone else has attained sincerity.\nFor more details, please see this category: Sincerity\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/240287/how-to-achieve-sincerity-in-your-deeds-in-islam
267450,"Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {The sun cannot catch up with the moon, nor can the night outstrip the day. Each floats in its own orbit} [Ya-Sin 36:40]. I read that someone on the Internet says that this is a contradiction – I ask Allah for forgiveness – because in the case of a solar eclipse, the sun has caught up with the moon and the night has come during the day. I know that this is not true, so I hope that you can give me a response to put a stop to this specious argument.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nYou should understand that Allah, may He be exalted, is the One Who created and fashioned in due proportion, and made all things according to a measure and guided them, and everything in the universe testifies to the greatness and might of Allah, may He be exalted.\nHe has told us about His creation, and the Maker knows best about what He has made, so Allah, may He be exalted, knows best about His creation: {How could He Who created not know His own creation, when He is the Knower of subtleties, the All-Aware?} [Al-Mulk 67:14].\nMoreover, you should understand that the [pagan] Arabs heard these verses, and they were the keenest of people to find fault with the Qur’an. Solar and lunar eclipses occurred at the time of the [pagan] Arabs, yet there is no report to indicate that any of them objected to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) by saying that “the sun had caught up with the moon, so how could the Qur’an claim that the sun cannot catch up with the moon?”\nIndeed, not a single one of them presented this argument, which indicates that it is not as this person said; rather this stems from a misunderstanding of the verses and a misunderstanding of natural phenomena too.\nSecondly:\nWhat the verse means is that the sun cannot rise at night, because the night is the time for the moon to rise, and the moon cannot rise during the day, because that is the time for the sun to rise.\nImam Ibn Jarir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIt is not appropriate for the sun to catch up with the moon, because that would lead to the light of the sun covering the light of the moon, so it would be day all the time, with no night. {Nor can the night outstrip the day} [Ya-Sin 36:40]. Here Allah, may He be exalted is saying that the night should not overwhelm the day, because that would lead to its darkness cancelling out the light of day, so it would be night all the time. Al-Tabari (19/438).\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: And He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{It is He Who made the sun a radiant light and the moon a reflected light, and ordained its phases, so that you may know how to count the years and measure time}\xa0[Yunus 10:5]\n{We have made the night and the day as two [of Our] signs. We obscured the sign of the night with darkness and gave light to the sign of the day, so that you might seek the bounty of your Lord and know the number of the years and the reckoning of time. And We have explained all things in detail}\xa0[al-Isra’ 17:12].\nAllah has given the sun its own radiant light and has given the moon its own reflected light, and He has made a difference between the orbits of both of them. Hence the sun rises every day and sets at the end of the day, and its light is always the same, but the point of its rising and setting varies between the summer and the winter, as a result of which days become longer and nights become shorter, then nights become longer and days become shorter. And He has caused it to be dominant during the day, so it is a diurnal heavenly body.\nAs for the moon, He has ordained phases for it. On the first night of the month, it appears small, with little light, then its light increases on the second night and it rises higher, and the higher it rises the more light it has, even though its light is a reflection of the sun’s light, until its light becomes complete on the fourteenth night. Then it starts to decrease in size until the end of the month, until it becomes like an old date-stalk, dried-up and curved.\nRegarding the words, {The sun cannot catch up with the moon}, Mujahid said: Each of them has a limit or orbit that it cannot go beyond, and it cannot fall short of that. When one is dominant, the other disappears, and when the dominant one disappears, the other one dominates. Tafsir Ibn Kathir (6/578).\nAl-Tahir Ibn ‘Ashur (may Allah have mercy on him) said: What is meant is an affirmation that they cannot collide, so the sun cannot collide with the moon, and vice versa.\nHe said: What is meant is that the sun cannot collide with the moon, contrary to the way they appear, for they seem to be close. Al-Tahrir wa’l-Tanwir (23/24).\nWhatever meaning we choose from the above, there is no contradiction between this verse and the occurrence of solar and lunar eclipses, because that is not the kind of catching up that is referred to in this verse.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/267450/commentary-on-the-verse-the-sun-cannot-catch-up-with-the-moon-ya-sin-3640-and-its-connection-to-solar-and-lunar-eclipses
100449,"I heard that the one who swears a false oath (Yameen Al-Ghamus) will be immersed in Hell, and that there is no expiation for it. Does this mean that there can be no repentance from this sin?","['Praise be to Allah.What is Al-Yamin Al-Ghamus?\nAl-Yamin Al-Ghamus refers to a false and evil oath in which a person unlawfully consumes the property of another. It is called Ghamus (lit. immersing) because it immerses the one who does that in sin and then in Hell. (Ibn Al-Athir in An-Nihayah, 3/724)\xa0\nSecondly:\xa0\nIt says in Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah (35/41):\xa0\n“The jurists differed concerning the necessity of expiation in the case of a false oath . There are two points of view:\xa0\n\nIt is not obligatory to offer expiation for a false oath . This is the view of the majority of jurists: the Hanafis, Malikis and Hanbalis.\xa0\nIt is obligatory to offer expiation for a false oath . This is the view of the Shafi`is. \xa0\n\nEach group offered evidence to support its view.” (See: Bada’i` Al-Sana’i, 3/3; Al-Taj wAl-Iklil, 3/266; and Kashf Al-Qina`, 6/235)\nIt says in Fatawa Al-Lajnah Al-Da’imah (23/133):\xa0\n“Al-Yamin Al-Ghamus is a major sin, for which no expiation is sufficient because it is such a grave sin. No expiation is required for it according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions; rather what is required is repentance and prayers for forgiveness.”\xa0\nWhether one says that expiation is required or not, the expiation does not expiate the sin of a false oath. Rather it is essential to repent sincerely.\xa0\nHence Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in Majmu` Al-Fatawa (34/139), after mentioning the difference of scholarly opinion concerning expiation for a false oath:\xa0\n“But they agreed that the sin is not erased merely by offering expiation.”\nDoes repentance expiate false oaths?\nA false oath, like other sins, may be expiated by sincere repentance . There is no sin for which repentance cannot be accepted, for Allah has opened the door of repentance to every sinner , and Allah accepts the repentance of the one who repents.\xa0\nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Say: O My slaves who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allah, verily, Allah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” [Az-Zumar 39:53]\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \xa0\n“This verse is a call to all sinners, disbelievers and others, to repent and turn to Allah. It tells us that Allah forgives all sins for the one who repents from them and turns away from them, no matter what they are, no matter how many they are, even if they are like the foam of the sea. There are many verses on this topic.”\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/100449/does-repentance-expiate-false-oaths
