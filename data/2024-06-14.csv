109320,Is it permissible for us to separate Tawaf and Sa`i by two hours or more and do Sa`i after that?,"['Praise be to Allah.Yes, there is nothing wrong with delaying Sa`i after Tawaf , although it is better to do Sa`i straight after Tawaf .\xa0\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Mughni (10/240):\xa0\n“It is not obligatory to do Sa`i immediately after Tawaf .\xa0\nImam Ahmad said: There is nothing wrong with delaying Sa`i until one has rested or until evening.\xa0\n`Ata’ and Al-Hasan did not see anything wrong with the one who had circumambulated the Ka`bah at the beginning of the day delaying As-Safa and Al-Marwah until evening. This was done by Al-Qasim and Sa`id ibn Jubayr.”\xa0\nIt says in Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah:\xa0\n“The Sunnah is that Sa`i should be connected to Tawaf as much as possible, but if one delays Sa`i a great deal and then does it, that is valid.\xa0\nAnd Allah is the Source of strength. May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.” (Shaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn Baz, Shaykh `Abd Ar-Razzaq `Afifi, Shaykh `Abdullah ibn Qu`ud.\xa0Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah lil-Buhuth Al-`Ilmiyyah wal-Ifta, 11/263)\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“It is not essential that Tawaf and Sa`i be done one after the other, even if there is no reason for that, so if a person does Tawaf at the beginning of the day and Sa`i at the end, there is nothing wrong with that, or if he does Tawaf at the beginning of the night and Sa`i during the day, there is nothing wrong with that, because doing Tawaf and Sa`i one after the other is Sunnah, not obligatory.” (Majmu` Fatawa Ibn `Uthaymin, 23/201)\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/109320/can-you-take-a-break-between-tawaf-and-sai
256961,Are there any reports having to do with giving zakah on agricultural produce or any harvests from any other source for which it is not required that one Hijri year should have passed?,"['Praise be to Allah.With regard to zakah on agricultural produce, there follows a brief explanation of those harvests on which zakah must be given, their minimum thresholds (nisab) and how it is to be given, with evidence.\nTypes of crops on which zakah must be given:\nThe types of crops mentioned in the texts on which zakah must be given are four: wheat, barley, dates and raisins.\nThe scholars differed regarding crops other than these four, and there are many views, the most correct of which may be – and Allah knows best – that zakah is due on any crops and fruits that may be weighed and stored. See: ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘ by Ibn ‘Uthaymin (6/70).\nThe minimum threshold (nisab) for crops and fruits:\nThe minimum threshold (nisab) for crops and fruits is five wasqs, which is equivalent to approximately 612 kg.\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no zakah due on less than five wasqs…” Narrated by al-Bukhari (1378) and Muslim (979).\nThe rate of zakah that is due on crops:\nIt is obligatory to give one tenth or 10% of the total amount of what one has of these crops or fruits, on condition that they were irrigated without any extra costs, such as plants that are watered by rain or by rivers and streams, and also plants that are watered by means of deep roots (taproots) that reach any water source nearby, so that there is no need for extra costs for irrigating them, as in the case of date palms.\nAs for crops and fruits that are irrigated at some cost, such as those that are irrigated by mechanical means, zakah at a rate of half of one tenth, or 5%, of the total amount of what one has of these crops or fruits must be given. This is the view of the four imams, because of the Prophet’s words: “With regard to that which is irrigated by rainfall and springs, or has a taproot, (the zakah) is one tenth, and with regard to that which is irrigated by drawing water, (the zakah) is half of one tenth.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (1483).\nOn our website there is a previous detailed answer regarding this matter; see question no. 172973 .\nWhen does the zakah become due?\nThe time when the zakah on grains and fruits becomes due is when they first become ripe. As for the time when zakah is to be given, it is after threshing and cleaning grains, and after dates are dried.\nWe have previously explained that in detail, with evidence, in the answer to question no. 243326 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/256961/what-are-the-crop-harvests-on-which-zakah-must-be-paid
212827,"What is the ruling on putting cream on the thighs to prevent chafing after entering Ihram for `umrah? Please note that this cream, like all other creams, has a scent but it is not a scent like perfume.","['Praise be to Allah.In the answer to question no.\xa020019 ,\xa0we stated that what is forbidden during Ihram is putting on perfume or anything that has a scent . If the cream mentioned does not have any scent, then there is nothing wrong with using it.\xa0\nIt says in Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, vol. 2 (10/157):\xa0\nDuring Tawaf and Sa`i in Hajj and `Umrah, people often use creams to reduce the chafing between the thighs; as using perfume is one of the things that are forbidden when in Ihram, is using Daktacort [a hydrocortisone cream] in this case permissible or not?\xa0\nThey replied:\n“There is nothing wrong with using Daktacort cream – a sample of which was attached – and similar creams when wearing Ihram for Hajj or `Umrah, and it is not haram, because it is a kind of remedy and it is not a kind of perfume , so it does not come under the ruling on perfume .”\xa0\nBased on that, it is permissible for the pilgrim in Ihram to use creams on that area to prevent chafing, because the purpose here is using it as a remedy.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/212827/can-i-use-cream-in-ihram
81621,What is the ruling on fasting on Saturdays at times other than Ramadan? What if the day of ‘Arafah happens to be on a Saturday?,"['Praise be to Allah.Singling out Saturdays for fasting\nIt is makruh to single out Saturday for fasting, because of the report narrated by al-Tirmidhi (744), Abu Dawud (2421) and Ibn Majah (1726) from ‘Abd-Allah ibn Busr, from his sister, that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Do not fast on Saturdays apart from days when you are obliged to fast. If any one of you cannot find anything other than grape stalks or the twigs of a tree, let him chew it (to make sure that he is not fasting).” Classed as sahih by al-Albani in al-Irwa (960).\xa0\nAbu ‘Isa al-Tirmidhi said:\xa0\n“This is a hasan hadith. What is makruh in this case is for a man to single out Saturday for fasting, because the Jews venerate Saturday .”\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Mughni (3/52):\xa0\n“Our companions said: It is makruh to single out Saturday for fasting … what is makruh is singling out that day. If he fasts another day along with it, then it is not makruh, because of the hadith of Abu Hurayrah and Juwayriyah. If it coincides with a day that a person regularly fasts, it is not makruh.”\xa0\nWhat is meant by the hadith of Abu Hurayrah is the report narrated by al-Bukhari (1985) and Muslim (1144) from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: I heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “No one of you should fast on Friday, unless he fasts (a day) before it or after it.”\xa0\nThe hadith of Juwayriyah was narrated by al-Bukhari (1986) from Juwayriyah bint al-Harith (may Allah be pleased with her), that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) entered upon her on a Friday and she was fasting . He said; “Did you fast yesterday?” She said, “No.” He said: “Do you intend to fast tomorrow?” She said: “No.” He said: “Then break your fast.”\xa0\nThis hadith and the one before it clearly indicate that it is permissible to fast on a Saturday at times other than Ramadan, for the one who fasts the Friday before.\xa0\nIt is proven in al-Sahihayn that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The most beloved of fasting to Allah is the fast of Dawud; he used to fast one day and not the next.”\xa0\nIn this case it is bound to happen that he will sometimes fast on a Saturday on its own. So it may be understood from this that if Saturday coincides with a day that he habitually fasts, such as ‘Arafah or ‘Ashura’, there is nothing wrong with fasting on that day, even if it is on its own.\xa0\nAl-Hafiz stated in al-Fath that an exception to the prohibition on fasting on Friday is made if a person habitually fasts on a certain day, such as ‘Arafah, and it coincides with Friday.\xa0\nThe same applies to Saturday. We have quoted the words of Ibn Qudamah concerning that above.\xa0\nDifferent scenarios for fasting on a Saturday\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \xa0\n“It should be noted that different scenarios may apply with regard to fasting on a Saturday.\xa0\n1– It may be obligatory, such as observing a Ramadan fast during Ramadan or making it up later on, or observing a fast as expiation (kaffarah), or instead of offering a sacrifice when performing Hajj tamattu’, and so on. There is nothing wrong with that so long as he does not single it out deliberately thinking that there is some virtue in that.\xa0\n2– If he fasts on the Friday before, there is nothing wrong with it, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to one of the Mothers of the Believers who was fasting on a Friday : “Did you fast yesterday?” She said: “No.” He said: “Are you going to fast tomorrow?” She said, “No.” He said: “Then break your fast.” The words, “Are you going to fast tomorrow?” indicate that it is permissible to fast Saturday along with Friday.\xa0\n\xa0\n3– If it happens to be one of the days when it is prescribed to fast, such as Ayyam al-Beed (the 13\nth, 14th\xa0and 15th\xa0of each hijri month), ‘Arafah, ‘Ashura, six days of Shawwal for one who has fasted Ramadan, and the ninth of Dhul-Hijjah . There is nothing wrong with that, because he is not fasting because it is Saturday, rather it is because it is one of the days when it is prescribed to fast.\xa0\n4– When it happens to be a day when he habitually fasts, such as a person whose habit is to fast alternate days, and the day that he fasts happens to be a Saturday, then there is nothing wrong with it, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said when he forbade fasting one or two days before Ramadan begins: “except a man who (habitually) observes a fast, in which case let him fast.” This is similar.\xa0\n5– If he singles it out to observe a voluntary fast for one day only. This is what is forbidden, if the hadith forbidding it is proven to be sahih.” (Majmu’ Fatawa wa Rasail al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 20:57)\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/81621/fasting-on-saturdays-is-it-allowed
36869,Is it permissible to do a voluntary Sa`i?,"['Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“It is not permissible to do a voluntary Sa`i, because Sa`i is only prescribed as part of the rituals of Hajj or `Umrah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\xa0“Verily, As-Safa and Al-Marwah (two mountains in Makkah) are of the Symbols of Allah. So it is not a sin on him who performs Hajj or `Umrah of the House (the Ka`bah at Makkah) to perform the going (Tawaf) between them (As-Safa and Al-Marwah).
