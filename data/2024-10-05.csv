223528,"What I know is that Allah sent Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to all the living, accountable humans and jinn with the message of Islam. But must I also believe that Allah sent him to all creatures? As it is known that the word creatures is more general and includes more than just humans and jinn. Secondly: I know that his message was not only for the humans and jinn of his own time; rather it is for all the humans and jinn, those who lived at his time and those who came after them, but until when? Is it until the first of the major signs of the Hour appear, or until the Hour itself begins?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe Muslims are unanimously agreed, and it is narrated in mutawatir reports from our Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that Allah did indeed send him (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to the jinn and humankind.\n(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, 4/204 and 11/303)\nWith regard to the angels, most of the scholars are of the view that he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was not sent to them.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was sent to the two races, humankind and the jinn, but he was not sent to the angels. (End quote from Majmu‘ al-Fatawa, 12/222.\nHe also said in his book an-Nubuwwat (2/232):\nThe signs of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) which prove his prophethood must be miracles that are extraordinary for both humans and jinn, but it is not stipulated that they should be things that the angels are unable to do, because they (meaning the prophets) were not sent to the angels. (End quote)\nBased on that, it is not correct to say that Allah sent our Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to all creatures, because he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was not sent to the angels. Similarly, he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was not sent to other creatures which possess no reason, because they are not accountable and are not required to follow any divine system of law, such that a messenger would be sent to them from among them or from among others. Rather those who are made accountable, and Allah, may He be exalted, has made them qualified to be accountable, are humankind and the jinn, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was sent to both of them, as noted above.\nSecondly:\nAll of creation testifies to the truthfulness of the message of our Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) except the disbelievers among humankind and the jinn. Ahmad (14333) narrated that Jabir ibn ‘Abdillah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There is nothing between heaven and earth but it knows that I am the Messenger of Allah, except the sinners among the jinn and humankind.” The commentators on al-Musnad classed it as authentic. According to the version narrated by at-Tabarani: “… Except the disbelievers among the jinn and humankind.”\nThirdly:\nThe message of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to humankind and the jinn will remain until Allah inherits the earth and all those on it. Therefore everyone of the two races whom Allah creates until that time is accountable and is required to believe in the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and follow him.\nBut when the sun rises from its place of setting, a seal will be placed on people’s deeds, and whoever had not believed in the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) before that will not benefit from his belief, if he believes after the sun has risen from its place of setting. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Do they [then] wait for anything except that the angels should come to them or your Lord should come or that there come some of the signs of your Lord? The Day that some of the signs of your Lord will come, no soul will benefit from its faith as long as it had not believed before or had earned through its faith some good}\xa0[Al-An‘am 6:158].\nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The Hour will not begin until the sun rises from its place of setting. When the people see that, all those who are on earth will believe, but that will be when no soul will benefit from its faith as long as it had not believed before.” (al-Bukhari and Muslim)\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/223528/was-the-prophet-blessings-and-peace-of-allah-be-upon-him-sent-to-all-creatures-meaning-the-jinn-humans-and-others
266249,"How can I seek Barakah in everything I own, wealth, family, my own self and so on?","['Praise be to Allah.Barakah is one of the blessings of Allah, may He be Exalted, and the blessings of Allah, may He be Exalted, can only be sought and maintained by means of four things:\n\n\nBy obeying Allah, may He be Exalted, and obeying His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). That is achieved by doing what is enjoined and refraining from what is forbidden, and hastening to repent and seek forgiveness in the event of any shortcoming in doing what is obligatory or falling into anything that has been forbidden.\n\n\nAllah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And if only the people of the cities had believed and feared Allah , We would have opened upon them blessings from the heaven and the earth; but they denied [the messengers], so We seized them for what they were earning.} [Al-A`raf 7:96]\nAllah, may He be Exalted, says concerning the call of His Prophet Nuh (peace be upon him) [to his people]:\n{And [I] said, ‘Ask forgiveness of your Lord. Indeed, He is ever a Perpetual Forgiver. He will send [rain from] the sky upon you in [continuing] showers, and give you increase in wealth and children and provide for you gardens and provide for you rivers.} [Nuh 71:10-12]\nAllah, may He be Exalted, says concerning the call of His Prophethood (peace be upon him):\n{And to `Ad [We sent] their brother Hud. He said, `O my people, worship Allah; you have no deity other than Him. You are not but inventors [of falsehood]. O my people, I do not ask you for it any reward. My reward is only from the one who created me. Then will you not reason? And O my people, ask forgiveness of your Lord and then repent to Him. He will send [rain from] the sky upon you in showers and increase you in strength [added] to your strength. And do not turn away, [being] criminals.’} [Hud 11:50-52]\nAllah, may He be Exalted, says regarding the People of the Book (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And if only they upheld [the law of] the Torah, the Gospel, and what has been revealed to them from their Lord, they would have consumed [provision] from above them and from beneath their feet.} [Al-Ma’idah 5:66]\n\n\nOne of the greatest deeds of piety by means of which Barakah may be sought is upholding the ties of kinship, and not cutting off those ties.\n\n\nIt was narrated that Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “Whoever would like his provision to be increased and his life to be extended, should uphold the ties of kinship.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 2067 and Muslim, 2557)\n\n\nSimilarly, he should avoid prohibited matters in his interactions with people, such as cheating, usury and all other things that are forbidden.\n\n\nAllah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Allah destroys interest and gives increase for charities. And Allah does not like every sinning disbeliever.} [Al-Baqarah 2:276]\nThe commentator Shaykh Muhammad Al-Amin Ash-Shinqiti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Allah destroys interest” – in this verse it is clearly stated that He destroys riba (usury, interest), meaning that He will remove it altogether from the possession of the one who engages in it, or He will deprive him of any Barakah in his wealth, so that he will not benefit from it, as was stated by Ibn Katheer and others. (End quote from Adwa’ Al-Bayan, 1/270).\nIt was narrated that Hakim ibn Hizam (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The two parties to a transaction have the option (of cancelling it) until they part. If they are honest and disclose any defects, their transaction will be blessed, but if they lie and conceal defects the blessing will be erased.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 2079 and Muslim, 1532)\n\n\nBarakah may be sought by giving thanks to Allah, may He be Exalted, for His blessings. Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n\n{And [remember] when your Lord proclaimed, ‘If you are grateful, I will surely increase you [in favour.]} [Ibrahim 14:7]\nGratitude may be expressed in one’s heart, in one’s words and in one’s actions.\nGratitude in the heart means acknowledging that these blessings are solely by the grace of Allah, may He be Exalted, and not turning in one’s heart to anyone other than Him, as the disbelieving people of the Jahiliyyah did by attributing blessings to someone other than the Creator, may He be glorified and Exalted, as Allah, may He be Exalted, describes them (interpretation of the meaning):\n{They recognize the favour of Allah; then they deny it. And most of them are disbelievers.} [An-Nahl 16:83]\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“They recognize the favour of Allah; then they deny it” means: they acknowledge that it is Allah, may He be Exalted, Who has granted this to them and bestowed it upon them, yet despite that they deny this fact and worship others alongside Him, and they attribute His help and provision to someone other than Him.” (End quote from Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 4/592)\nGratitude in one’s words means attributing these blessings to the Creator, may He be glorified and Exalted, praising Him, may He be Exalted, for these blessings, and not boasting of one’s smartness, intelligence, strength and so on, for all of these are blessings from Allah, may He be Exalted.\nExpressing gratitude in one’s actions means not using these blessings to do things that Allah, may He be Exalted, has forbidden.\nPart of expressing gratitude in one’s actions is showing kindness to others, as Allah, may He be Exalted, has shown kindness to you, for showing kindness to others is a way to attain more of Allah’s kindness. Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Is the reward for good [anything] but good?} [Ar-Rahman 55:60]\n\n\nFollowing Islamic etiquette when using any of these blessings, such as saying Bismillah Ar-Rahman Ar-Rahim (in the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful) when eating, drinking, entering the house, and so on.\n\n\nIt was narrated from Jabir ibn `Abdullah that he heard the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “When a man enters his house, and mentions Allah, when he enters and when he eats, the devil says: `You have no place to stay and no dinner.’ But if he enters and does not mention Allah when he enters, the devil says, `You have found a place to stay.’ And if he does not mention Allah when he eats, he says: `You have found a place to stay and dinner.’” (Narrated by Muslim, 2018)\nThat also includes eating together and not eating separately; not being wasteful with food and drink, and so on; and spending according to need, without being extravagant or miserly.\nAllah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And give the relative his right, and [also] the poor and the traveller, and do not spend wastefully. Indeed, the wasteful are brothers of the devils, and ever has Satan been to his Lord ungrateful. And if you [must] turn away from the needy awaiting mercy from your Lord which you expect, then speak to them a gentle word. And do not make your hand [as] chained to your neck or extend it completely and [thereby] become blamed and insolvent.} [Al-Isra’ 17:26-29]\nThe Muslim should be keen to follow the Sunnah of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and what he taught his Ummah of manners and etiquette when dealing with people, with one’s family and with one’s wealth.\nOne of the most beneficial books concerning this matter, and one of the easiest to understand is Riyadh As-Salihin by Imam An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him).\n\n\nProtecting oneself by means of the Du`as and Dhikrs narrated in the Sunnah.\n\n\nThe Muslim should regularly recite the Adhkar for the morning and the evening, the Adhkar before going to sleep, and all kinds of Adhkar as prescribed in Islamic teachings.\nOne of the most beneficial books for learning the Adhkar and Du`as prescribed in the Sunnah, by means of which the Muslim may protect himself, his family and his wealth, is Hisn Al-Muslim min Adhkar Al-Kitab was-Sunnah \xa0by Shaykh Sa`id ibn `Ali ibn Wahb Al-Qahtani. [Available in English under the title Fortress of the Muslim: Invocations from the Quran & Sunnah].\nTo sum up, the Muslim may seek Barakah by means of Taqwa (piety, fearing Allah), which means refraining from that which is forbidden and doing as much as he can of that which is enjoined, and by repenting and seeking forgiveness, and by following the example of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in all his affairs.\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 10083, 100105.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/266249/how-to-get-barakah-in-islam
399630,"I heard that one of the reasons why a person may be punished in the grave is a man who recites the Quran by night but does not act in accordance with it by day. Does this mean that the man never acted in accordance with the Quran at all, or that he only acted in accordance with some of it?","['Praise be to Allah.It was narrated from Samurah ibn Jundub (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said regarding the dream he saw: “As for the man whose head was being smashed with a rock, he is one who studied the Quran but did not act upon it, and he went to sleep, neglecting the obligatory prayers.”\nNarrated by al-Bukhari (1143); it is part of a lengthy hadith narrated in Sahih al-Bukhari (7047).\nSee the hadith of Samurah in its entirety in the answer to question no. 11110.\nFor more information, see the answer to question no. 46068.\nWhat is meant by his head being smashed is that it was being crushed. End quote.\nWhat the hadith refers to is not acting in accordance with the Quran. Ibn Battal said: What it means is that he does not memorize its words or act in accordance with its meanings. As for one who does not memorize its words but does act in accordance with its meanings, he is not included in this hadith, but it is narrated in the hadith that he will be resurrected on the Day of Resurrection with no argument to defend himself. End quote.\nIbn Battal: Sharh Sahih al-Bukhari (3/135, 9/564).\nAt-Tini said: The words “fa naama ‘anhu (he went to sleep and missed it)” mean: he turned away from it.\nThe preposition ‘an (away from) in this phrase is used in the same way as in the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {alladhina hum ‘an salatihum sahun [But] who are heedless of their prayer} [al-Ma‘un 107:5]. In other words, they are heedless in the sense of abandoning it and not paying attention to it. This is the action of the hypocrites and evildoers.\nThe phrase “he went to sleep and missed it” means: he does not recite it at night, and he does not reflect on what the Quran includes of commands that he should follow and prohibitions to which he should pay heed, like the hypocrites and evildoers. If this is how he is at night, then he will not act during the day on what it contains.\nThis interpretation is supported by what is mentioned in another report narrated by al-Bukhari: “As for the man whose head was being smashed with the rock, he is the one who studied the Quran but did not act upon it, and he went to sleep, neglecting the obligatory prayers.”\nAs for the one who sleeps without staying away from the Quran, due to some shortcoming or incapacity, he is not included in this warning. End quote.\nAt-Tibi: Sharh al-Mishkat (9/3009-3010).\nTo sum up: one of the causes of that punishment is sleeping and not reciting or reading Quran, because one does not want to act on it and is not interested in it.\nAs for the one who does not do something due to some shortcoming or incapacity, he is not included in this warning.\nSee also the answer to question no. 45325.\nSecondly:\nThe believer should be keen to act in accordance with the Quran, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Follow [O humankind] that which has been sent down to you from your Lord, and do not follow any close associates besides Him.

He said: “As if they are two clouds, or two black canopies, with light between them, or as if they are two flocks of birds in ranks, pleading on behalf of their companions.” Narrated by Muslim (805).\nIt was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar said: There was a time in the past when we learned issues of faith before Quran, and when a surah was revealed to Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), he would learn what it said was halal and haram, and what he should pay attention to in that surah just as you are taught the Quran. Then he said: I have seen men, one of whom learns the Quran and recites it from beginning to end, without learning what it enjoins and forbids, or in which verses he should pause and pay attention, and he reads it at speed, like spreading out dates to dry.\nNarrated by al-Hakim in al-Mustadrak ‘ala as-Sahihayn (1/91, 101).\nAl-Fudayl said: The Quran was revealed to be followed, but people regard reciting it as all that is required of them to do.

130761,What is the evidence for commercial insurance being prohibited?,"['Praise be to Allah.Understanding the prohibition of commercial insurance\nCommercial insurance which is offered by most insurance companies is a kind of prohibited contract, whether it is insurance covering one’s life or possessions or anything else. The fact that it is prohibited is indicated by a number of texts and Shar`i principles, such as:\nThe ambiguity in insurance contracts\n\nInsurance is a transaction that involves ambiguity, and transactions that involve ambiguity are forbidden according to Shari`ah.\n\nMuslim (1513) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade ambiguous transactions.\nGharar in Arabic means a risk which\xa0is not certain; it may happen or not, such as selling fish in the water or birds in the air, because the purchaser may or may not get it.\nAl-Azhari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Gharar transactions include any transactions in which something is not known.\xa0\xa0(Mu`jam Maqayees Al-Lughah, 4/380-381; Lisan Al-`Arab (6/317).\nAl-Khattabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe root meaning of the word ambiguity is that which is wrapped up and concealed from you. Any transaction which is based on ambiguity or on inability to achieve something is Gharar. There are many kinds of ambiguity, which all involve not knowing exactly what the transaction involves.\xa0 (End quote)\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWith regard to the prohibition on ambiguous transactions, this is a very important principle with regard to commercial transactions, and includes many issues, such as selling things that are not present or are unknown, and so on. All of these are invalid transactions because there is ambiguity with no reason for that.\nSome kinds of ambiguity may be tolerated when engaging in a transaction if there was a reason for it, such as not knowing about the foundations of the house; this transaction is still valid because the foundations belong to what can be seen of the house, and because there is a reason for this, as it is not possible to see the foundations.\nThey unanimously agreed that it is invalid to sell foetuses that are in utero and birds in the air. The scholars said: The reason for it being invalid is because of ambiguity. (End quote)\nThe scholars agreed that a great deal of ambiguity is not permissible, but a little of it may be overlooked. They differed as to what constitutes a little or a great deal.\xa0(Bidayat Al-Mujtahid, 2/187; An-Nawawi said something similar in Sharh Muslim)\nInsurance policies are among the contracts that involve a great deal of ambiguity; even lawmakers themselves have affirmed that insurance contracts are based on probabilities, which means ambiguous, because neither the insurer nor the insured can know at the time of entering into the contract what he will give or take. The person who takes out insurance may pay one instalment, then an accident may happen and the insurer is obliged to give what he agreed to give to him, or perhaps nothing will happen at all, so he will pay all the instalments and not take anything.\nThe element of gambling in insurance\n\nInsurance contracts are a kind of gambling\n\nGambling is prohibited, as it was forbidden by Allah, when He said (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Intoxicants (all kinds of alcoholic drinks), and gambling, and Al-Ansab (stone altars for sacrifices to idols etc), and Al-Azlam (arrows for seeking luck or decision) are an abomination of satan’s handiwork. So avoid (strictly all) that (abomination) in order that you may be successful.} [Al-Ma’idah 5:90]\nWhat is meant by gambling is when a person pays something of his own money and takes a risk: either he will gain more than it or he will lose the money that he paid.\nInsurance is a transaction that is connected to a risk that may or may not happen, so it is, in effect, gambling, because the person who takes out insurance is taking the risk by paying the premium. Either he will take more than it or he will lose it if the risk against which he is insured does not happen.\nThe person who is insured may pay twenty and take one thousand, or he may pay one thousand and take one thousand, or he may pay one thousand and not take anything if the risk against which he was insured does not happen.\nIs this not taking risks and gambling?\nThe presence of Riba in insurance contracts\n\nInsurance involves Riba An-Nasi’ah and Riba Al-Fadl, in the event that compensation is paid\n\nMuslim (1587) narrated that `Ubadah ibn As-Samit (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Gold for gold, silver for silver, wheat for wheat, barley for barley, dates for dates, salt for salt, like for like, same for same, hand to hand. But if these commodities differ, then sell as you like, as long as it is hand to hand.”\nThis Hadith indicates that if a person sells gold for gold, it must be equal amounts and the exchange completed in the same sitting.\nSo it should be sold gram for gram, with nothing added, and the exchange must be completed in the same sitting. It is not permissible for the two parties to separate without each of them having taken what is due to him.\nIf a person sells gold for gold with a difference in the amount, then they have fallen into riba Al-fadl. If the exchange is not completed then they have fallen into Riba An-Nasi’ah, i.e., interest charged when hand-to-hand exchange is delayed.\nIf gold is sold for silver then the exchange must be completed in the same sitting, and it is permissible for there to be a difference in the amounts. So a gram of gold may be sold for 10 g of silver, for example, but it is not permissible for them to separate without the exchange having been completed.\nCurrency comes under the same ruling as gold and silver in this regard. It is not permissible to exchange one currency for another unless the exchange is completed in the same sitting. If the currency is all the same, then it must be like for like and the exchange should be completed, just as if gold were being exchanged for gold.\nInsurance includes Riba of both types: Riba Al-Fadl and Riba An-Nasi’ah.\nWhat that means is that what the insurance gives to the person who takes out insurance, or to his heirs, if the risk defined in the contract happens, will be one of three things: either it will be less than what he paid or more than that or equal to it.\nIn all these cases what the company gives to the insured person happens after he pays the insurance instalments during a period of which the end is in fact unknown.\nSo the reality of the transaction is that it is paying money for money to be given at a later date.\nIf the amounts are equal, then this is Riba An-Nasi’ah; if more [or less] is paid, then it is Riba Al-Dadl and An-Nasi’ah, both of which are prohibited on their own so how about if they are combined?\nConsuming wealth unlawfully through insurance\n\nInsurance is consuming people’s wealth unlawfully\n\nConsuming people’s wealth unlawfully is prohibited.\nAllah Says (interpretation of the meaning): {O you who believe! Eat not up your property among yourselves unjustly except it be a trade amongst you, by mutual consent.} [An-Nisa’ 4:29]\nWhat is invalid is every way which is not permitted by Shari`ah, and which involves stealing, betrayal, robbery, gambling, Riba-based contracts and corrupt transactions. This was stated by Abu Hayyan (may Allah have mercy on him) in his commentary on this verse.\nWhat is meant by insurance involving consuming people’s wealth unlawfully is if the money paid by the insurance to the person who is insured is more than he paid — such as if the risk occurs after paying just one instalment — then on what basis is he entitled to this money? And if the risk does not occur, then on what basis is the insurance company entitled to the payments made by the person who was insured without anything in return?\nStatistics by a German expert have proven that the ratio of payments made by insurance companies in compensation to individuals is equivalent to no more than 2.9% of the total amount of payments made.\nOn what basis is the insurance company entitled this money, and in return for what?\nThe imposition of Non-Shar`i obligations\n\nInsurance contracts make obligatory things that are not obligatory according to Shari`ah\n\nInsurance contracts oblige the insurance company to pay compensation, if the risk against which insurance was taken happens. On what basis is this made binding? The insurance company did not cause the danger or make it happen; it did not commit any acts of aggression or shortcoming, so how can it be forced to pay compensation for something for which it is not liable according to Shari`ah?\nThe social and individual harm of insurance\n\nInsurance harms both individuals and society\n\nIn addition to what is mentioned above, insurance is not free of other harmful effects, among the most important of which are the following:\nTaking things lightly: it makes the people insured careless about protecting their property against calamity; they may even go further than that and cause accidents or make accidents worse. This causes a great deal of harm to individuals. For example, some drivers whose lives and cars are insured may become careless and not pay heed to traffic laws and regulations, which exposes individuals to harm caused by accidents and car crashes.\nEach one of these reasons is sufficient to indicate that commercial insurance is prohibited and that insurance contracts are invalid contracts which are not permitted by Shari`ah, and that it comes under the heading of consuming people’s wealth unlawfully. So how about when all these reasons are combined?\nHence the majority of contemporary scholars have ruled that all forms of commercial insurance are prohibited. Statements have been issued by the Council of Senior Scholars in the Land of the Two Holy Sanctuaries and by the Islamic Fiqh Councils in Jeddah and Makkah, that commercial insurance is prohibited according to consensus, and not one member of the Council disagreed.\nWe have quoted a great deal of these statements and fatwas in the answers to various questions on our site.\nSee a lengthy discussion of commercial insurance in Abhath Hay`at Kibar Al-`Ulama`, 4/33-315.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/130761/why-is-commercial-insurance-prohibited
