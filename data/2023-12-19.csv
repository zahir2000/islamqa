467842,Is it permissible for one who is not fasting to eat the meals that are distributed in al-Masjid al-Nabawi for those who are fasting to break their fast?,"['Praise be to Allah.It is permissible for those who are not fasting to eat the food that is offered on the mats that are put out in al-Masjid al-Haram and al-Masjid al-Nabawi for those who are fasting to break their fast. That is because the custom is that those who offer this food put out those mats and do not prevent anyone from taking food, and they do not only call those who are fasting, and they are aware that many of those present are not fasting. So this is permission, according to custom, for anyone to take that food. This is something that all people are aware of, and a custom of which all people are aware comes under the same ruling as that which is stated verbally. So there is no reason why those who are not fasting should not eat these meals.\nShaykh ‘Abdullah al-Maqdisi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: When someone gives an invitation to a meal and serves the food, that is permission to eat, because of the report narrated by Abu Hurayrah from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), who said: “If one of you is invited to a meal, and he comes with the messenger who was sent to invite him, that is permission [to eat].” Narrated by Ahmad and Abu Dawud. ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud said: If you have been invited, then you have been given permission [to eat]. This was narrated by Imam Ahmad with his isnad…\nIn al-Ghunyah – by Shaykh ‘Abd al-Qadir al-Jili (may Allah be pleased with him) – it says: No permission is needed after the food is served, if the custom in that land is that the people eat when the food is served, because the custom itself is permission to eat.""(Sharh Dalil al-Talib\xa03/313).\nBut if there are ready-made meals that are only intended for those who are fasting, then it is not permissible for those who are not fasting to eat them, unless permission is given by those who are distributing them, after telling them about the situation, if they are authorised to give such permission.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/467842/can-those-who-are-not-fasting-eat-the-food-that-is-put-out-for-iftar-in-al-masjid-al-nabawi-the-prophets-mosque
105325,I work as a web designer. The websites I design do not contain pictures of women or pictures that are not Islamically acceptable. I do not use songs or music in my designs. All I do is design the site page. Is my work permissible? Is the money I earn permissible or prohibited?,"['Praise be to Allah.Is graphic designing prohibited in Islam?\xa0\nThis is an issue that is of widespread concern nowadays, as the result of the spread of sin and all kinds of prohibited things. There is hardly any field in which Satan does not try to spread evil in it, to such an extent that the Muslims are becoming very confused about what is permissible and what is prohibited, and it has become very difficult for them to purify their earnings and avoid any prohibited elements in them. Allah is sufficient for the pious and for His believing slaves. He sees that they want to obey Him and hate to disobey Him, and He will reward them and grant them forgiveness. \xa0\nIn Islamic Shari`ah, one of the principles of permissible business and trade is that it should not be something by means of which Allah is disobeyed, so it should not be a means of sinning or lead to falling into prohibitions. When Islam forbids a thing, it also forbids everything that may lead to it or help with it, and Islam enjoins blocking all the means that lead to it.\nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Help you one another in Al-Birr and At-Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression. And fear Allah. Verily, Allah is Severe in punishment.” [Al-Ma’idah 5:2]\nShaykh `Abd Ar-Rahman As-Sa`di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“One is required to refrain from every sin and act of wrongdoing, and to help others to refrain also.” (Tafsir As-Sa`di, p. 218)\xa0\nIt says in Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah (3/140):\xa0\n“According to the majority of jurists it is not acceptable to sell grapes to one who will use them to make wine, or to sell means of gambling to a gambler, or a house that will be used as a church, or to sell wood to one who will make it into a cross, or to sell copper to one who will make it into a bell. The same applies to everything which it is known that the purchaser intends to use for something that is not permissible.”\nIf the seller, designer or producer, is certain that what he designs will be used for prohibited purposes , it is not permissible for him to sell it or produce it. The same ruling applies if he thinks that is most likely, even if he is not certain.\xa0\nHowever, if he is in doubt or does not know how the item he is selling or producing will be used, then there is no harm in selling it and designing it, and the sin will fall on the one who uses it for prohibited purposes. \xa0\nIbn Hazm (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“It is not permissible to sell anything to one who will certainly use it to disobey Allah, and such transactions are permanently null and void, such as selling anything that may be squeezed or pressed to one who it is certain will use it to make alcohol, or selling a slave to one who it is certain will mistreat his slave, or selling weapons or horses to those who it is certain will use them to attack the Muslims, or selling silk to one who it is certain will wear it, and so on, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Help you one another in Al-Birr and At-Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression. And fear Allah. Verily, Allah is Severe in punishment.” [Al-Ma’idah 5:2]\nThe kinds of transactions that we have mentioned are obviously kinds of cooperating in sin and transgression, without going into detail, so annulling them is cooperating in righteousness and piety.\xa0\nIf no such thing is known for certain, then the transaction is valid, because it is not helping in sin. If the purchaser disobeys Allah after that, then the sin is on the purchaser only and not on the seller.” (Al-Muhalla, 7/522)\xa0\nThe same ruling applies to the brother who asked the question:\xa0\nIf someone comes to you and you know that he wants to design a website that he will use for prohibited purposes, such as Riba-based banking or indecent pictures or selling prohibited things such as alcohol , pork or cigarettes, or websites for movies and music , then it is not permissible for you to design the website for him, and it is not permissible for you to help him in the evil that he wants to do; rather what you must do is advise him and guide him and remind him to fear Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted.\xa0\nNonetheless, if you do not know anything about the reason he is asking for website design, or if the site will most likely be used for permissible and beneficial things, then there is nothing wrong with you designing it and selling it, even if the owner will include some prohibited things in it, because the rulings of Shari`ah are based on what is most likely to be the case and not on rare instances.\xa0\nIs it permissible to use pictures of children in graphic designs?\nWith regard to the ruling on including pictures of children on the websites that you design, that is not permissible. We have stated previously that it is prohibited to make images, whether they are drawn by hand or made with a machine (a camera), and no exceptions are made from this ruling except that which is absolutely necessary, such as pictures in passports and other things that are needed.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/105325/can-a-muslim-work-as-a-web-designer
289172,Is it haram to use live bait to catch fish with worms or another kind of small animal that tends to help alot when catching fish compared to using fake equipment?,"['Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with fishing using live worms or some insects or small fish, if there is a need to do so. But if there is no need for that, it is disliked (makruh), because it involves tormenting these creatures.\nIt says in Kashshaf al-Qina‘ (3/152): It is valid to sell that which may be used as bait, such as an owl that is used as bait by tying it up, and when the target bird comes to it, it is caught. It is disliked (makruh) to do that, because it involves tormenting the bird that is used as bait. It is also valid to sell worms for fishing.”\nIf it is possible to kill the worms by removing their heads before using them as bait, and they are still good to use for fishing, then that is better.\nMuslim (1955) narrated that Shaddad ibn Aws said: There are two things that I memorized from the Messenger of Allah (blessing and peace of Allah be upon him). He said: “Allah has prescribed proficiency in all things, so if you kill, kill well, and if you slaughter, slaughter well. Let one of you sharpen his blade and spare suffering to the animal he slaughters.”\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/289172/ruling-on-using-live-bait-for-fishing
246965,"Which of these phrases is a metonymic statement of divorce: “our Lord will spread out for you of His mercy” [Al-Kahf 18:16] or “O Allah, compensate me with someone better than her and compensate her with someone better than me”?","['Praise be to Allah.Guidelines on Implicit phrases of divorce\nThe guideline with regard to metonymic (implicit)\xa0statements of divorce is that metonymic statements include any phrase that may be understood as referring to divorce or something else, such as: “Go to your family ,” or: “It is over between us ,” and so on.\nIn Hashiyat Al-Bujayrami `Ala Al-Khatib (3/491), it says:\n“With regard to the words “any phrase that may be understood as referring to divorce or something else”, the guideline is that this applies to wording that may indicate an imminent separation, but it is not widely used as a Shar`i term or a customary term.”\nIn Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah (29/26), it says:\n“The scholars are agreed that the metonymic form of divorce means using words that are not usually used for that purpose but could be understood as meaning divorce or something else. However, if the wording could never mean divorce in the first place, then this is not a metonymic form of divorce; rather it is merely nonsense talk and does not imply anything.”\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Any wording that could be understood to refer to separation comes under the heading of metonymic statements of divorce."" (Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti`\xa0 13/70)\nDoes divorce count when lmplicit phrases are used?\nDivorce does not count as such when metonymic phrases are used, unless two conditions are fulfilled:\n\nthe person should have the intention of divorce,\xa0\nand he should have used words that are indicative of divorce.\xa0\n\nIf he utters words that are not indicative of divorce , either in Shar`i terms or according to customary usage, then even if he intended divorce by using those words, it does not count as such.\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Divorce does not count as such unless the person intends it and uses wording that is indicative of divorce. If one of these two factors is missing, then no divorce takes place.\nWords and phrases may be divided into those that are explicit and those that are metonymic. Although dividing them in this manner is acceptable in principle, the issue may vary from one person, time or place to another. Therefore, there is no fixed ruling on a particular phrase; a phrase may be regarded as explicit among some people and as metonymic among others, or it may be regarded as explicit in one time or place, and as metonymic in some other time or place.\nWe see this in reality. Hardly anyone uses the phrase “release” [Al-Ahzab 33:28] with regard to divorce, either explicitly or metonymically, so it is not appropriate to suggest that if a man uses this word then his divorce of his wife is binding, whether he intended it or not."" (Zad Al-Ma‘ad\xa0 5/291)\nBased on that, the phrase “our Lord will spread out for you of His mercy” [Al-Kahf 18:16] is not indicative of divorce, either according to customary usage or in Shar`i terms. Based on that, it is not a metonymic form of divorce.\nAs for the phrase “O Allah, compensate me with someone better than her and compensate her with someone better than me”, it was narrated from Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) that any supplication that refers to divorce could be used as a form of divorce.\xa0\nHe was asked about a man who said to his wife: May Allah separate me and you in this world and the hereafter. He said: If he intended it as a supplication only, I hope that it does not mean anything. (Masa’il Abu Dawud lil Imam Ahmad (p. 239); Al-Insaf, 8/478)\nIbn Muflih (may Allah have mercy on him) commented on this in Al-Furu` (9/38):\n“He did not regard it as meaning anything when one’s intention is simply supplication, from which we may understand that it means something when there is an intention of divorce, or when it is used in general terms, on the basis that the word separate or separation is an explicit term, or because of the context in which he said it.”\nThen he (may Allah have mercy on him) mentioned a similar case and said:\n“The ruling concerning these three issues is the same. It seems that concerning each issue there are two views: will the context be taken into account and is it sufficient to indicate his intention, or should only the intention be taken into account?”\nWhat that means is: the supplication “May Allah separate me and you in this world and the hereafter” is a metonymic form of divorce. There are two reports from Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) about metonymic forms of divorce and whether the intention is essential for the divorce to be valid, or is circumstantial evidence sufficient? In a number of Fatwas on our website we have stated that the correct view is that metonymic forms of divorce do not count as such unless they are accompanied by the intention of divorce, and circumstantial evidence is not sufficient.\nBased on that, the supplication mentioned in the question, “O Allah, compensate me with someone better than her and compensate her with someone better than me”, is a metonymic form of divorce; if the husband intended divorce thereby, then it counts as such, and if he did not intend that, then it does not count as such.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/246965/guidelines-concerning-implicit-phrases-of-divorce
