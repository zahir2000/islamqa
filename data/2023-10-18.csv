114656,"I have a grandfather who is stingy with his property… He has quite a few useful books that he bought when he was young, including some useful Islamic books, some of which are out of print and not available in the market. I am a seeker of knowledge, and I want to make use of them, but he will not let me do that. Is it permissible for me to take them by stealth and make use of them and keep them?","['Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to transgress against the property of another person by stealing, plundering, seizing by force or taking it without his permission, even if that is by way of borrowing. The ruling on the books in this regard is the same as the ruling on other kinds of property, hence the majority of scholars ruled that the hand of one who steals them is to be cut off.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Mughni (9/98): If he steals a Mus-haf, Abu Bakr and al-Qadi said: His hand is not to be cut off for that. This is the view of Abu Hanifah…\nAbu’l-Khattab favoured the view that his hand is to be cut off, and he said: This is the apparent meaning of the words of Ahmad. He was asked about someone who stole a book containing knowledge to study it, and he said: Anything of which the value reaches three dirhams, the hand of the one who steals it is to be cut off. This is the view of Malik, ash-Shafa‘i, Abu Thawr and Ibn al-Mundhir, because of the general meaning of the verses which speak about all thieves.…\nThere is no difference of opinion among our companions regarding the fact that the hand of the thief is to be cut off for stealing books of jurisprudence, hadith and all other Islamic sciences.\nIt says in al-Mawsu ‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (34/193): The Malikis, Shafa‘is and Hanbalis, and Abu Yusuf among the Hanafis, are of the view that the hand of one who steals a beneficial book – such as a book of tafsir, hadith, jurisprudence or other beneficial sciences – is to be cut off, if the value of the stolen item reaches the minimum threshold. End quote.\nSo you have no right to take these books by stealth, or to keep them. Rather you must ask permission, then if he gives you permission and lets you borrow them, all well and good, otherwise you have no right to take them. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “It is not permissible to take the property of anyone unless he gives it willingly.” Narrated by Ahmad (20172); classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami‘ (7662).\nThis is not the only way to seek knowledge. You can come to an agreement with your grandfather to go to his house and read the books there, and not take them away.\nOr you can go to the public library, where – in sha Allah – you will find many useful books.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/114656/ruling-on-taking-books-by-stealth-from-his-grandfather-to-learn-from-them-and-keep-them
20935,"I have eczema which was under control until I started doing Wudu 5 times a day. I have tried everything I can think of, but nothing is helping. What can I do if Wudu is causing very bad rashes?","['Praise be to Allah.Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope.”\xa0[Al-Baqarah 2:286]\nAbu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “… if I forbid you from doing\xa0 something, avoid it, and if I command you to do something, do as much as you can.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 6858; Muslim, 1337)\xa0\nAlthough Allah has clearly commanded us to do Wudu with water, He exempted the sick from having to do Wudu with water and has allowed them to do Tayammum .\xa0Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“O you who believe! Approach not As-Salah (the prayer) when you are in a drunken state until you know (the meaning) of what you utter, nor when you are in a state of Janabah (i.e. in a state of sexual impurity and have not yet taken a bath), except when travelling on the road (without enough water, or just passing through a mosque), till you wash your whole body. And if you are ill, or on a journey, or one of you comes after answering the call of nature, or you have been in contact with women (by sexual relations) and you find no water, do Tayammum with clean earth and rub therewith your faces and hands (Tayammum). Truly, Allah is Ever Oft-Pardoning, Oft-Forgiving.”\xa0[Al-Nisa’ 4:43]\nShaykh Muhammad Al-Salih Al-‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Or if he is afraid of using it or if looking for it will cause him physical harm:\xa0\nIf he will be physically harmed by using water and will become sick, then this comes under the general meaning of the words (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“But if you are ill or on a journey.”\xa0[Al-Maidah 5:6]\nFor example, if there are wounds or sores on the parts of the body that are washed during Wudu, or if there are wounds or sores on all parts of the body, in the case of Ghusl (ritual bath), and there is the fear of physical harm, then he may do Tayammum.” (Al-Sharh Al-Mumti’, 1/378, 379; Ibn Al-Jawzi edition)\xa0\nBut if he can put water on his skin without affecting it, then he should do so, and he does not have to rub that part of the body or go to extremes in washing it.\xa0\nShaykh Muhammad Al-Salih Al-‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Similarly he does not have to go to extremes in rinsing his nose if he has a problem in the sinuses, because in that case the water may settle there and cause an unpleasant smell and make him sick, or it may cause him some harm. It should be said to such a person: it is sufficient for you to rinse your nose until the water enters the nostrils.” (Al-Sharh Al-Mumti’, 1/210, Ibn Al-Jawzi edition)\xa0\nHe also said:\xa0\n“If a person has a sinus problem, or if going to extremes in rinsing the nose will make the water reach the sinuses and cause him pain, or if the water will turn rotten and turn to pus and so on, in this case we say to him: Do not go to extremes in rinsing your nose, so as to ward off harm from yourself.” (Al-Sharh Al-Mumti’, 1/172. Ibn Al-Jawzi edition)\xa0\nIf Wudu will harm your skin or delay your recovery, then you should do Tayammum , and there is no sin on you.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20935/resorting-to-tayammum-if-one-has-eczema
112427,"In the past, I had some devices that are used for entertainment – such as a television, PlayStation, and so on – that I acquired from some of my friends. Because I used them excessively, and not in a good way, I failed to do many obligatory duties. I want to ask about how I can get rid of them. Is it permissible for me to sell them, or should I just destroy them?","['Praise be to Allah.First of all, you should praise Allah, may He be exalted, for having alerted you to save you from heedlessness and wasting time with such things, for they are one of the traps of the Shaytan, into which many young people fall who do not realise how dangerous they are. Young people may spend many years of their lives without striving, advancing or succeeding, and one of them may not come to his senses until he has spent long years of his life playing computer games or watching TV programs that do not benefit him in his worldly affairs and do not increase his faith. Whoever Allah, may He be exalted, saves from this calamity is truly blessed and has been granted well-being by Him, may He be glorified.\nNext, we advise you that it is essential to be careful about how you dispose of these things. If you can use them in ways that are permissible and beneficial, that is best, such as if you can use the television to watch useful and beneficial channels. Otherwise, if you fear that you may become addicted to television again, then you have no other choice except to get rid of it by selling it or giving it to someone who you think is good and righteous, so that he will not use it except for permissible purposes.\nAs for the PlayStation, we do not advise you to keep it; rather you should sell it or give it to someone who has children and will supervise them when they play with it, but will not give them free rein with it.\nAs for selling these devices (the television and PlayStation), or giving them to someone who does not pay attention to the sacred limits set by Allah, it is not permissible to do that, because this will be helping him in sin.\nWe ask Allah to bless you in your life and your work, and to enable you to obey Him.\nPlease see also the answers to questions no. 2898 and 39744 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/112427/how-can-he-get-rid-of-some-devices-used-for-entertainment
21534,"I have some questions about Islam, could you explain them for me? What does Islam say about people of other religions? Are all non-Muslim people regarded as sinners because they do not follow Allah and Islam? Can any non-Muslim person enter Paradise without following Islam?","['Praise be to Allah.The ruling of Islam concerning other religions is that they are all either fabricated and false, or abrogated.\xa0\nThe fabricated and false religions are those like the ancient Arabian practise of worshipping idols and stones.\xa0\nThe abrogated religions are those which were taught by the Prophets who came before our Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).\xa0\nThey are valid in that their origins are from Allah, but Islam came and took their place, not with regard to basic beliefs such as the existence of God , the angels, Paradise and Hell, for these are matters which all the Messengers have in common, but there are differences between them with regard to ways of worshipping and drawing close to Allah by means of prayer, fasting, pilgrimage, alms, etc.\xa0\nThe later followers of the Prophets have fallen into deviations of belief and Shirk (associating partners or equals with Allah), but Islam came to point that out and bring people back to the correct belief taught by the earlier Prophets.\xa0\nAbu Al-Darda (may Allah be pleased with him) said: `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) brought some pages of the Torah to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said, “O Messenger of Allah, these are some pages of the Torah which I took from a brother of mine from (the tribe of) Banu Zurayq.” The expression of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) changed, and ‘Abdullah ibn Zayd (may Allah be pleased with him) – who had been shown the Adhan [in a dream] – said, “Has Allah taken away your mind? Do you not see the expression on the face of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)?” ‘Umar said, “We are pleased with Allah as our Lord and with Islam as our religion and with Muhammad as our Prophet and with the Quran as our guide.” Then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) relaxed, and said, “By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, if Moses (peace be upon him) were to come among you and you were to follow him and leave me, you would have gone far astray. You are my share among the nations and I am your share among the Prophets.” (Narrated by Ahmad, 15437)\xa0\nIbn Hajar said:\xa0\n“All the Isnads (chains of narration) of this Hadith are such that they could not be taken as evidence individually, but when taken together they prove that this Hadith is correct.” (Fath Al-Bari, 13/525)\xa0\nThe evidence for that is the verse in which Allah says (interpretation if the meaning):\xa0\n“And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers”\xa0[Al ‘Imran 3:85]\nImam Al-Tabari (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his commentary on this verse:\xa0\n“Allah means that whoever looks for a religion to follow other than Islam, Allah will never accept that from him, ‘and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers’ meaning, he will be of those who have deprived themselves of their share of the mercy of Allah.” (Tafsir Al-Tabari, 3/339)\xa0\nIslam does not regard them (followers of other religions) only as sinners, but as disbelievers who will abide forever in the Fire of Hell, as stated in the verse quoted above.\xa0\nThe disbeliever will be a loser in Hell, and will not come out of it. It is not possible for a disbeliever to enter Paradise unless he becomes Muslim. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Verily, those who reject Our verses (and signs) and treat them with arrogance, for them the gates of heaven will not be opened, and they will not enter Paradise until the camel goes through the eye of the needle (which is impossible). Thus do We recompense the (wicked) criminals.”\xa0[Al-A’raf 7:40]\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “By the One in Whose Hand my soul is, no one of this nation, Jew or Christian, will hear of me and not believe in that with which I have been sent, but he will be one of the people of Hell.” (Narrated by Muslim)\xa0\nWe ask Allah to guide the seekers of truth from other religions to look into the religion of Islam and its Book, the Quran. May Allah guide them and open their hearts to enter Islam.\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 14055 , 9607 , 308807 , and 21525 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21534/what-does-islam-say-about-other-religions
