155116,What is the ruling on using cornstarch for cosmetic purposes in some sensitive areas?,"['Praise be to Allah.The jurists differed concerning the ruling on using food for personal hygiene and the like, and there are two views:\nThe first view is that it is permissible and allowed, and there is nothing wrong with using some food items and types of food for the purpose of hygiene and the like.\nThis was stated by the Hanafis and it is mentioned in one report from Imam Malik. It was also the view favoured by Ibn Qudamah among the Hanbalis.\nIt says in al-Fatawa al-Hindiyyah (5/337) – which is a Hanafi book – that Abu Hanifah (may Allah have mercy on him) did not see anything wrong with cleaning the hands with flour after eating. His two companions, Abu Yusuf and Muhammad ibn al-Hasan, were of the same view.\nAn-Nafrawi al-Maliki (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe permissibility of that was narrated from Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him), as he said – regarding Indian pea (chickling vetch, Lathyrus sativus), fava beans (foul) and similar foods –: There is nothing wrong with cleaning one’s hands with them, or scrubbing oneself with them in the bath.""(Al-Fawakih ad-Dawani\xa0 2/321).\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIt was said to Abu ‘Abdillah (Imam Ahmad): What do you say about cleaning one’s hands with the residue left in a sieve? He said: There is nothing wrong with it; we do that.\nAl-Khattabi quoted as evidence for the permissibility of that the report narrated by Abu Dawud with his isnad from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), according to which he instructed a woman to add salt to the water, then wash off menstrual blood with it. Abu Dawud (313); it was classed as da‘if (weak) by al-Albani. Salt is food, and there are similar reports.""(Al-Mughni\xa0 7/221).\nFor more information, please see the answers to questions no. 59899 , 84903 , 145307 .\nThere is nothing wrong with using food items for the purpose of personal hygiene and the like, and that is not regarded as wasting it; rather it is using it for a purpose that is required according to Islamic teachings. Cleaning oneself and making oneself look good are things that are prescribed and encouraged in Islamic teachings.\nThe second view is that it is disliked to use food items for personal hygiene purposes. This is the official view of the Malikis and Hanbalis, but the Hanbalis limited that disapproval (makruh) to using staple foods, not all types of foods.\nAl-Bahuti al-Hanbali (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIt is disliked to clean one’s hands with food if it is a staple food, even if it is flour made from chickpeas, lentils, beans and so on.""(Kashshaf al-Qina‘\xa0\xa05/172).\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThey quoted as evidence for it being disliked to clean one’s hands with staple foods the fact that this leads to those foods becoming contaminated with impurities and dirt. That is why it is not allowed, just as it is not allowed to remove impurities using such foods. Salt is not a staple food; rather it is used to improve the flavor of staple foods.\nYes, it is not allowed to for either humans or jinn to clean themselves after relieving themselves using staple foods of humans and animals. Hence the residue left in a sieve should not be used for cleaning oneself after relieving oneself, even though it is permissible to clean one’s hands with it.\nBut if there is a need to use staple foods, such as tanning with barley flour, or using yoghurt and flour as a remedy for scabies, and the like, then a concession should be granted allowing that…\nThis is the answer that may be given regarding salt, because it is being used for a need.\nAnother piece of evidence is the fact that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed us to lick our fingers and the plate, and to pick up a dropped morsel and remove the dirt from it. All of that is so that no staple food will be wasted, and using it to scrub oneself is not appropriate because something else may be used instead, and it comes under the heading of extravagance, which is the work of the Shaytan. End quote.\nI was asked about a similar case – namely cleaning one’s hands with musk – and I said: This is extravagance, unlike following the traces of menstrual blood with a cloth perfumed with musk, because the latter is a tiny amount that is used for a need, but cleaning the hands with musk is too much and is unnecessary. End quote.\nQuoted by Ibn Muflih in al-Adab ash-Shar‘iyyah (3/211).\nThe right thing is not to use food items for personal hygiene and the like, because there are many readily-available things that can be used instead of them, and that is furthest removed from extravagance and luxury.\nBut if it so happens in some situation that there is nothing available to use for the purpose of personal hygiene except things that are food items, or there is a need for that, then we hope that there will be nothing wrong with using such things in that case, because of need.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/155116/ruling-on-using-food-items-for-personal-hygiene-purposes
72220,"I am in alot of trouble. I can not ask local Iman because he is not good in his knowledge and I am embarrassed to ask friends or family. You see, the problem is I got married recently and I think I might have committed zina with my wife. This is how we were driving my sister's car and me and my wife stopped the car in a quiet place and we kissed a lot, quite a lot. a man walked passed and he saw us, but we did not stop. I feel I have committed open zina. Do we need to pay Kafarah (expiation), or confess to our elders? My second very very important question is after kissing, I let out (we were both wearing clothes all the time mufti sab) sperm in my underwear. Now I feel very bad because this is my sister's car and she has been driving it after me. i can not wash the car seat as she will get suspicious and confront me. i do not want to lie, now she sits in the car sits on the floor to eat dinner, sits on the sofa, her and her children and i feel very very bad as to what to do. is the car and sofa and place were we sit not clean anymore, and my wife and i are arguing she blames me for worrying. i think she is a bad muslim, because she does not fear Allah, because she made me stop the car and kiss, i hate her for that. Dear sir, I await your reply as I am disturbed by what has happened, i like to keep pak and clean at all times to please Allah.","[""Praise be to Allah.The nature of human imperfection\nPlease note that you will never be able to live your life without sins and mistakes. This is the nature of man. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Every son of Adam commits sin, and the best of those who commit sin are those who repent.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 2499 and Ibn Majah, 4251. It was classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Tirmidhi)\nThis Hadith clearly indicates that man will inevitably commit sin, but what matters after that is what he does about his sin. The believer repents to Allah from all his sins, gives them up and asks Allah for forgiveness every time he commits a sin, and he regrets doing it and resolves sincerely not to do it again. If you do that, then understand that Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful; He forgives all sins for the righteous believer who repents sincerely and admits his sin humbly before Allah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): {Say: O My slaves! who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allah, verily, Allah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.} [Az-Zumar 39:53]\nIs kissing one’s wife in public Zina?\nThe sin that you have admitted to is not Zina with your wife! Rather it is kissing her in front of other people, because there is no Zina with one's wife, rather Zina is done with a woman whom it is not permissible for a man to touch . But in the case of a wife, it is permissible to touch her. \nIs it prohibited to kiss your wife in public?\nIt is not permissible for a man or a woman to speak to anyone else of what happens between them in bed which no one else should see but them, because of the evils and temptations that result from that and because it opens the door to the devil. This has to do with one who speaks about what he did with his wife, so how about one who does things in front of people where they can see him! \nShaykh Muhammad ibn Ibrahim (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his Fatawa (10/277) that kissing one’s wife in front of people is not permissible . \nExpiation for kissing one’s wife in public\nAs for the expiation for this sin , there is no expiation except sincere repentance and firm resolve not to do it again, and true regret for having committed this sin. \nAs for confessing to your parents, there is no need for that. The sin that you have admitted to is a sin against Allah, so confession should be made to Allah. It is between you and Allah and you should not tell anyone about it, but be sincere in your repentance to Allah and Allah will forgive you. Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. \nThe fact that your wife is the one who told you to do this deed does not mean that she is not a righteous woman or that she does not fear Allah. You also agreed with her to do it, and you did not stop even when that man saw you. So you should also shoulder your share of responsibility for what you did. \nMay Allah help you to do that which He loves and which pleases Him. \nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/72220/is-it-prohibited-to-kiss-your-wife-in-public
470045,Are our salawat conveyed to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) at times other than Friday?,"['Praise be to Allah.Our blessings (salawat) upon the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) are conveyed to him at all times, as is proven in the sound hadiths. It was narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has angels who travel around on earth, conveying to me the salaams of my ummah.” An-Nasa’i (1282); classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih an-Nasa’i (1215).\nIt was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no one who sends greetings of salaam to me but Allah will restore my soul to me so that I can return his greeting of salaam.” Narrated by Abu Dawud (2041). Its isnad was classed as jayyid (good) by al-‘Iraqi in Takhrij al-Ihya’ (2/764). It was classed as hasan by Shaykh al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud (1779).\nSecondly:\nThe conveying of our blessings (salawat) upon the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on Friday is something special that is distinct from other days. If it is encouraged to do a good deed at a specific time or in a specific place or situation, that indicates that it has a distinct virtue in that case. We may or may not understand that distinct virtue, because basically it is an act of worship, so it is not essential to understand it.\nIn the hadith it is narrated that Aws ibn Aws said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The best of your days is Friday. On it Adam was created, on it he died, on it the trumpet will be sounded, and on it all people will swoon. So send a great deal of blessings (salawat) upon me on that day, for your blessings\xa0\xa0 will be conveyed to me.” They said: O Messenger of Allah, how will our blessings be conveyed to you when you have turned to dust? He said: “Indeed Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has forbidden the earth to consume the bodies of the prophets.” Abu Dawud (1047); classed as sahih by al-Albani.\nSome of the scholars found some distinctive qualities in the conveying of the blessings (salawat) on that specific day, which are mentioned in the context of explaining the reason why it is encouraged to send a great deal of blessing upon the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on that day. They are as follows:\n-1-\nSending blessings (salawat) upon the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is one of the best acts of worship, and it is better on Friday than on other days, because it is singled out for a reward that is seventy times greater than on other days. The fa’ in the words “fa inna salatakum ma‘rudatun ‘alayya (for your blessings will be presented to me)” explains the reason mentioned. In other words, they will be presented to me as gifts are presented to their recipients. Thus they are virtuous deeds that will bring you closer to me, as a gift brings the giver closer to the recipient. As this is the case, then we should do a great deal of that at virtuous times, for righteous deeds increase in virtue when done at virtuous times, therefore the blessings will be conveyed to the Prophet on a day that is better than other days. See: Sharh Sunan Ibn Majah by al-Harari (7/49).\n-2-\nFriday is a day that is witnessed by the angels, and this witnessing by the angels on Friday makes the blessings more virtuous than on other days, and the angels’ conveying of the blessings is more important than on other days. According to the version narrated by Ibn Majah from Abu’d-Darda’: “Send a great deal of blessings on me on Friday, for it is witnessed; the angels witness it.” See: Sharh Sunan Abi Dawud by Ibn Ruslan (7/351).\n-3-\nSending blessings (salawat) upon the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is a supplication (du‘a’), and on Friday there is an hour when supplications are answered. So part of proper etiquette with the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and part of acknowledging his rights is praying for blessing upon him at such times, so that the blessing will be conveyed to the Prophet when there is the hope that this supplication will be answered.\n-4-\nFriday is singled out as being a day of extra virtue for some acts of worship, such as walking to the prayer, offering supplication and reading Surat al-Kahf. Similarly, sending blessings upon the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on Friday has a special virtue, and the conveying of blessings to the Prophet is better on that day than on other days.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/470045/are-our-salawat-conveyed-to-the-prophet-blessings-and-peace-of-allah-be-upon-him-at-times-other-than-friday
98477,"What is the ruling on a man removing excessive hair from his face with a thread? Whether it is on the beard, between the eyebrows or on the forehead?","['Praise be to Allah.Is it permissible for men to remove hair from the beard?\nIt is not permissible for a man to remove anything from his beard because of the many Hadiths which enjoin leaving it alone and letting it grow. The definition of the beard is that which grows on the jawbones, cheeks and chin.\xa0\nCan men pluck hair from the forehead or between eyebrows?\nAs for hair other than that, such as the hair that grows on the forehead and between the eyebrows , there is nothing wrong with removing it according to some scholars.\xa0\nOthers are of the view that it is not allowed, especially if it is removed by plucking, with a thread or otherwise.\xa0\nWhat is Namas?\xa0\nThe reason for the difference of opinion is the difference of opinion about the meaning of the word Namas (plucking) which is mentioned in the Hadith which curses the one who does that.\xa0\nSome of them interpreted it as specific to the eyebrows and some interpreted it as including all facial hair. Namas is prohibited for both men and women, because it is changing the creation of Allah, and there is no difference between men and women in this case.\xa0\n\nThe first view – which is that Namas applies only to the eyebrows – was held by a number of scholars, and the scholars of the Standing Committee issued Fatwas on that basis. They stated that it is permissible to remove facial hair apart from the beard and eyebrows.\nThe second view – which is that Namas refers to removal of all facial hair – was held by many scholars and was favoured by Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him), who said it is not allowed for men to pluck hair from their faces.\xa0\n\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked): What is the ruling on plucking grey hairs from the hair and beard?\xa0\nHe replied:\xa0\n“With regard to the beard or facial hair it is prohibited, because this is Namas. Namas means plucking the facial hair, of which the beard is a part, and it was proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed the woman who plucks facial hair and the woman who has that done. We say to this man: if you were to look for every hair that has turned white and pluck it out, you would have no beard left. So leave what Allah has created as He created it and do not pluck anything.\xa0\nBut if it refers to plucking hair from the head, it does not reach the level of being prohibited, because that is not Namas.” (Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin, 11/123)\xa0\nIt seems – and Allah knows best – that Namas refers specifically to removing hair from the eyebrows. Based on that, there is nothing wrong with a man removing hair from his face other than the beard and eyebrows.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/98477/can-men-pluck-hair-from-the-forehead-or-between-eyebrows
