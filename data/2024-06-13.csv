256961,Are there any reports having to do with giving zakah on agricultural produce or any harvests from any other source for which it is not required that one Hijri year should have passed?,"['Praise be to Allah.With regard to zakah on agricultural produce, there follows a brief explanation of those harvests on which zakah must be given, their minimum thresholds (nisab) and how it is to be given, with evidence.\nTypes of crops on which zakah must be given:\nThe types of crops mentioned in the texts on which zakah must be given are four: wheat, barley, dates and raisins.\nThe scholars differed regarding crops other than these four, and there are many views, the most correct of which may be – and Allah knows best – that zakah is due on any crops and fruits that may be weighed and stored. See: ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘ by Ibn ‘Uthaymin (6/70).\nThe minimum threshold (nisab) for crops and fruits:\nThe minimum threshold (nisab) for crops and fruits is five wasqs, which is equivalent to approximately 612 kg.\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no zakah due on less than five wasqs…” Narrated by al-Bukhari (1378) and Muslim (979).\nThe rate of zakah that is due on crops:\nIt is obligatory to give one tenth or 10% of the total amount of what one has of these crops or fruits, on condition that they were irrigated without any extra costs, such as plants that are watered by rain or by rivers and streams, and also plants that are watered by means of deep roots (taproots) that reach any water source nearby, so that there is no need for extra costs for irrigating them, as in the case of date palms.\nAs for crops and fruits that are irrigated at some cost, such as those that are irrigated by mechanical means, zakah at a rate of half of one tenth, or 5%, of the total amount of what one has of these crops or fruits must be given. This is the view of the four imams, because of the Prophet’s words: “With regard to that which is irrigated by rainfall and springs, or has a taproot, (the zakah) is one tenth, and with regard to that which is irrigated by drawing water, (the zakah) is half of one tenth.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (1483).\nOn our website there is a previous detailed answer regarding this matter; see question no. 172973 .\nWhen does the zakah become due?\nThe time when the zakah on grains and fruits becomes due is when they first become ripe. As for the time when zakah is to be given, it is after threshing and cleaning grains, and after dates are dried.\nWe have previously explained that in detail, with evidence, in the answer to question no. 243326 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/256961/what-are-the-crop-harvests-on-which-zakah-must-be-paid
212827,"What is the ruling on putting cream on the thighs to prevent chafing after entering Ihram for `umrah? Please note that this cream, like all other creams, has a scent but it is not a scent like perfume.","['Praise be to Allah.In the answer to question no.\xa020019 ,\xa0we stated that what is forbidden during Ihram is putting on perfume or anything that has a scent . If the cream mentioned does not have any scent, then there is nothing wrong with using it.\xa0\nIt says in Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, vol. 2 (10/157):\xa0\nDuring Tawaf and Sa`i in Hajj and `Umrah, people often use creams to reduce the chafing between the thighs; as using perfume is one of the things that are forbidden when in Ihram, is using Daktacort [a hydrocortisone cream] in this case permissible or not?\xa0\nThey replied:\n“There is nothing wrong with using Daktacort cream – a sample of which was attached – and similar creams when wearing Ihram for Hajj or `Umrah, and it is not haram, because it is a kind of remedy and it is not a kind of perfume , so it does not come under the ruling on perfume .”\xa0\nBased on that, it is permissible for the pilgrim in Ihram to use creams on that area to prevent chafing, because the purpose here is using it as a remedy.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/212827/can-i-use-cream-in-ihram
36869,Is it permissible to do a voluntary Sa`i?,"['Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“It is not permissible to do a voluntary Sa`i, because Sa`i is only prescribed as part of the rituals of Hajj or `Umrah.

506779,"I am a driver for female teachers, and I am committed to being present during working hours, and I am very punctual and assiduous in my work. One month, after the first week of the month had passed, one of the teachers asked to switch to another driver, even though I did not do anything wrong.","['Praise be to Allah.If the contract between you states that payment is to be made on a monthly basis, then she must pay for the month in full, because the contract of hire is binding on both parties, and the one who does not make use of the service for which he signed the contract is the one who is at fault for no longer making use of the service, so the fee cannot be waived.\nIt says in al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah al-Kuwaitiyyah (1/253):\nThe basic principle regarding contracts of hire, according to the majority of scholars, is that such contracts are binding, and neither party can unilaterally cancel the contract except for a reason on the basis of which a binding contract may be nullified, such as a defect or problem with the item or service in question, or if it can no longer be made use of.\nThey quoted as evidence for that the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {O you who have believed, fulfill [all] contracts} [al-Ma’idah 5:1]. End quote.\nIbn Qudamah said: A contract of hire or rental is a binding contract, which means that the one who is hiring or renting will pay the fee and will make use of the item or service in question. If he cancels the deal before the end of the contract period, and no longer makes use of the item or service in question by his own choice, the contract is not cancelled and the fee is still owed.…\nAl-Athram said: I said to Abu ‘Abdillah (Imam Ahmad): A man hired a camel, then when he came to Madinah, he said to him: Cancel the deal for me. He said: He has no right to do that, and he must pay the fee.""(Al-Mughni\xa0 8/23).\nIt says in al-Ma‘ayir ash-Shar‘iyyah in the section on hiring and renting: It is permissible to cancel a contract of hire or rental with the agreement of both parties, but neither of them has the right to cancel it [unilaterally] except in the case of unforeseen circumstances.\nMoreover, the one who is renting or hiring has the right to cancel because of a fault or defect that appears in the item being rented or hired, which prevents him from making use of it.""(Al-Ma‘ayir ash-Shar‘iyyah, p. 141).\nIf no unforeseen reason arises that prevents making use of the item, and there is no excuse or reason to cancel the contract, then the contract of hire or rental is binding, so long as the driver – in the case mentioned in the question – made himself available to transport the teacher, and committed himself to that in the customary manner, and there was nothing to prevent her from travelling with him.\nThat is reinforced by the fact that the custom in your country is that once the month has begun, if the user of the service did not withdraw from the contract, then the fee must be paid.\nBased on that, the teacher must pay the month’s fee in full, unless you reach an agreement that she will pay for only one week, or less or more than that, and reaching a deal is better.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/506779/if-someone-who-is-renting-or-hiring-some-facility-or-service-stops-making-use-of-it-with-no-excuse-is-he-obliged-to-pay-the-fee-in-full
145105,Muslim female who has been earning since a few years but recently came to know that Qurbani is wajib on her because she is earning. How can she compensate for all those previous years for which she did not offer sacrifice.,"['Praise be to Allah.Is Ud-hiyah obligatory?\nThe scholars (may Allah have mercy on him) differed with regard to the ruling on Ud-hiyah : is it obligatory or Sunnah Mu’akkadah (a confirmed Sunnah)? The correct view is that Ud-hiyah is Sunnah Mu’akkadah for the one who can afford it, but there is no sin on the one who does not do it.\xa0\nWhat happens if you do not offer Ud-hiyah for rears?\xa0\nIf a person does not offer Ud-hiyah although he can afford to do so, he is missing out on a lot of reward that results from offering the sacrifice, but he is not sinning, and he does not have to make up for what he missed in years past, because Ud-hiyah is Sunnah and the time for it has gone. This is the case if he did not make a vow to offer a sacrifice, in which case it is obligatory for him to fulfil his vow and offer Ud-hiyah .\xa0\nIt says in Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah (34/46): “If a person does not offer a sacrifice before the time has passed, if it was a voluntary sacrifice he should not offer it; rather he has missed the opportunity to offer a sacrifice this year. But if it was a vow, he has to offer a sacrifice and make up for what he was obliged to do.”\xa0\nBased on that, if she wants to offer Ud-hiyah , then from now onwards she has to prepare ahead of time, so that when the next `Eid Al-Adh-ha comes, in sha Allah, she will have prepared her sacrifice beforehand, so she will not have missed the time for Ud-hiyah , as happened in the past.\xa0\nWe ask Allah to help us and you to do that which He loves and which pleases Him, and to accept righteous deeds from us and from you.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/145105/what-happens-if-you-do-not-offer-ud-hiyah-for-years
