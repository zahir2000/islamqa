484077,"I am a female obstetrician and gynaecologist (OB/GYN). Is my late father’s having spent on my education regarded as knowledge that will benefit him? Is it permissible for me to form the intention and dedicate the reward of my work to him, so that the reward for reducing the pain of my female patients, and protecting their ‘awrahs from being uncovered in front of male doctors, will reach him after he has died? Is this scenario included in the hadith, “When the son of Adam dies, his good deeds come to an end except three”– one of which is beneficial knowledge?","['Praise be to Allah.What your father did of spending on your education in this specialty will undoubtedly bring great reward, and what a father spends on his child is one of the greatest types of charity. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) stated that spending on one’s child brings great reward, and it takes precedence over other kinds of charity.\nIn the hadith it says that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The best dinar that a man spends is a dinar that he spends on his dependents, and a dinar that a man spends on his mount (for jihad) in Allah’s cause, and a dinar that he spends on his companions (in jihad) in Allah’s cause.”\nAbu Qilabah said: He started with the dependents. Then Abu Qilabah said: What man is greater in reward than a man who spends on young dependents and protects them from resorting to asking of people – or Allah benefits them through him – and makes them independent of means? Narrated by Muslim (994).\nSecondly:\nThe knowledge that you learned brings great benefit to Muslim women and provides them with medical treatment without having to see male doctors; this is one of the greatest benefits of which your father was a cause. It is known that a benefit that has far-reaching effect will bring reward to the one who initiated it, even if he did not have that particular intention in mind.\nSo we hope that there will be much good and great reward for your father for everyone who benefits from your treating them, because of his contribution and his being the cause of your education, without anything being detracted from your reward, in sha Allah.\nWhoever is the cause of some good deed being done will have a reward like that of the doer. It was narrated that Abu Mas‘ud al-Ansari said: A man came to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and said: My mount has died; give me a mount. He said: “I do not have anything.” A man said: O Messenger of Allah, I will tell him about someone who will give him a mount. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The one who tells another about a good deed is like the one who does it.” Narrated by Muslim (1893).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: [If someone does] deeds from which others benefit, he will be rewarded for benefitting others, even if he did not have that intention when he did that deed. Hence the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) stated that if someone sows a crop or plants a tree, and an animal eats from it or someone steals from it, he will be rewarded for that, even though he may have planted it without forming that intention; rather so long as people benefit from it, he will be rewarded for that.\nThis is also indicated by the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{No good is there in much of their private conversation, except for those who enjoin charity or that which is right or conciliation between people}\xa0[an-Nisa’ 4:114].\nThis indicates that if a person does that, even if it is simply to bring about reconciliation between people without seeking reward, there is goodness in that. Then Allah says:\n{And whoever does that seeking means to the approval of Allah - then We are going to give him a great reward}\xa0[an-Nisa’ 4:114].\nThis is something additional to the good which Allah mentions at the beginning of the verse.""(Liqa’ al-Bab al-Maftuh\xa0 32/9).\nWith regard to the hadith, “When a man dies, all his good deeds come to an end except three: ongoing charity (sadaqah jaariyah), beneficial knowledge, or a\xa0 righteous son who will pray for him” [narrated by Muslim 1631], what it refers to is whatever beneficial knowledge a person teaches to others from which people benefit. That includes beneficial worldly knowledge, foremost among which is medicine. Ash-Shafa‘i (may Allah have mercy on him) said: I do not know of any knowledge, after knowledge of what is halal and haram, that is more noble than medicine. End quote from Siyar A‘lam an-Nubala’ (10/57). Medicine is only of such high status because of what it contains of goodness and benefit, and because all people need it.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Regarding the hadith “When a man dies, all his good deeds come to an end except three: ongoing charity (sadaqah jaariyah), [and] beneficial knowledge…”, does this refer to Islamic knowledge or worldly knowledge?\nHe replied: What appears to be the case is that the hadith is general in meaning; any knowledge that is of benefit will earn that reward, but the foremost knowledge is Islamic knowledge. So if we assume that a man taught someone beneficial skills, and the one who learned that from him benefitted from learning it, then he will attain the reward and be rewarded for that.""(Liqa’ al-Bab al-Mahtuf\xa0 16/117).\nSo if someone teaches people beneficial worldly knowledge, he is included in the words of the hadith “or beneficial knowledge.” The same applies to the one who plays a role in conveying and spreading this knowledge and its benefits; there is the hope that he will also have a share of this reward, for the bounty of Allah is immense.\nIn the hadith narrated from ‘Uqbah ibn ‘Aamir (may Allah be pleased with him), he said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will admit three people to paradise by virtue of one arrow: the one who made it, intending good by making it, the one who shoots it, and the one who hands it to him.” Narrated by Ahmad in his Musnad (17300). The commentators said: The hadith is hasan when all its isnads and corroborating evidence are taken into account.\nThe scholars of the Permanent Committee for Ifta’ said: Printing useful books which benefit people regarding their religious and worldly affairs comes under the heading of the righteous deeds for which a person will be rewarded during his lifetime, and the reward and benefit thereof continue after he dies. That is included in the general meaning of the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) which are soundly narrated in the hadith of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When a man dies, all his good deeds come to an end except three: ongoing charity (sadaqah jaariyah), beneficial knowledge, or a\xa0 righteous son who will pray for him.” \xa0Narrated by Muslim in his Sahih. So anyone who plays a part in spreading this beneficial knowledge will attain this great reward, whether he is an author, a teacher, a publisher who distributes it to people, a designer, or one who plays a part in printing it. Each of them will be rewarded according to his efforts and the extent of his participation in that.""(Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah\xa0 11/17).\nThus there is the hope that everyone who contributes to education, and everyone who is a cause or helps in that will have reward for the beneficial knowledge.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/484077/does-a-father-educating-his-children-come-under-the-heading-of-knowledge-that-will-benefit-him-after-he-dies
82400,"What is the ruling on one who swears that his wife will be divorced if she does something such as severing the ties of kinship, and the husband is in a state of extreme anger at that point, and he is not in control of himself, to such an extent that he does not remember what he said?","['Praise be to Allah.Muslims should not take divorce lightly\nA man should not use divorce every time there is an argument between him and his wife, because of the negative consequences that result from divorce. Many men take the matter of divorce lightly and every time there is an argument between them and their wives, they swear to divorce them, and every time they have a disagreement with their friends, they swear to divorce their wives, and so on. This is a kind of toying with the Book of Allah, because the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) regarded the one who divorced his wife three times in one go as toying with the Book of Allah. So how about one who makes divorce his habit, and every time he wants to stop his wife doing something or urge her to do something he swears that he will divorce her?\xa0\nAn-Nasa’i (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated that Mahmud ibn Labid (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was told about a man who divorced his wife three times in one go. He got up angrily and said: “Will the Book of Allah be toyed with when I am still among you?”\xa0 A man stood up and said: “O Messenger of Allah, shall I kill him?” \xa0\nAl-Hafidh (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The men of its chain of narrators are trustworthy.” It was classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Ghayat Al-Maram (261).\xa0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “These foolish men whose tongues utter the words of divorce for every issue, great or small, are going against the teachings of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) who said: “Whoever wants to swear an oath, let him swear by Allah or else remain silent.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 2679) If the believer wants to swear an oath, let him swear by Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. It is also not right to swear a great deal, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“And protect your oaths (i.e. do not swear much).” [Al-Ma’idah 5:89]\nOne of the interpretations of this verse is that it means: do not swear a great deal.\xa0\nBut if they swear an oath of divorce, such as saying, “I will divorce you if you do such and such,” or “I will divorce you if you do not do such and such,” or “If you do such and such my wife will be divorced,” or “If you do not do such and such my wife will be divorced,” and other such phrases, these go against the teachings of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).” (Fatawa Al-Mar’ah Al-Muslimah, 2/753)\nIs conditional divorce valid?\nWhen a man says to his wife, “If you do such and such then you are divorced,” or, “If you do not so such and such then you are divorced,” this is a conditional divorce . The majority of jurists are of the view that this divorce counts as such when the condition mentioned is fulfilled.\xa0\nSome of the scholars – and this was the view favoured by Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) and others – were of the view that this condition is subject to further discussion, and it depends on the intention of the one who said it.\xa0\nIf he meant what is intended by the oath, which is to encourage someone to do something, or to stop someone from doing something, or to affirm something or deny something, then it comes under the ruling on oaths and no divorce takes place, but he must offer the expiation for breaking an oath when it is broken.\xa0\nIf he intended thereby to divorce his wife, then she is divorced when the condition is fulfilled. His intention is known only to Allah from Whom no secret is hidden. So the Muslim should beware of trying to deceive his Lord and of deceiving himself.\xa0\nThe Standing Committee was asked about a man who said to his wife: “Come with me or you are divorced,” and she did not go with him. Does that count as a divorce?\xa0\nThey replied:\xa0\n“If you did not intend that as a divorce and you only wanted to urge her to go with you, then that does not count as a divorce, but you have to offer the expiation for breaking an oath according to the more correct scholarly view. If you intended that to count as a divorce if she did not respond to you, then that counts as one divorce.” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 20/86)\xa0\nIs divorce in anger valid?\nIt should be noted that most cases of divorce occur at moments of anger , stress and agitation, not when one is feeling happy and relaxed. If a husband divorces his wife at a time of anger, that does not mean that the divorce does not count, as many people think, except if the anger reaches such an extent that the man loses his reason and is not aware of what he is saying, in which case it does not count as a divorce according to scholarly consensus.\xa0\nBut if it has not reached such an extent that he loses his reason, but the anger is so intense that the man is no longer in control of himself, then the majority of scholars are of the view that this anger does not mean that the divorce does not count.\xa0\nSome scholars are of the view that it does mean that the divorce does not count. This was the ruling issued by Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) and his student Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him), and it is the correct view in sha Allah. See the discussion on that in question no.\xa045174 . We have only referred to the view of the majority so that the questioner and readers may understand the seriousness of uttering the word of divorce, at times of anger and at other times. It may lead to the breakup of his family and to harm for himself and his family because of his haste and his unruly tongue. We ask Allah to keep us safe and sound.\xa0\nIf the oath that he swore concerning his wife happened when his anger had reached such an extent, then it does not count as a divorce, in sha Allah.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/82400/is-conditional-divorce-valid
138693,"If the end of my menses is approaching, am I obliged to wake up before Fajr prayer in order to find out whether my period has ended or not? Please note that it had not ended before ‘Isha’ prayer. Do I have to wake up before sunrise in order to find out whether my period has ended or not? Please note that my period had not ended before the time of Fajr prayer.","['Praise be to Allah.If the end of a woman’s period is approaching, she does not have to wake up before Fajr to check whether her period has ended or not, because that comes under the heading of extra effort and hardship of which this ummah has been relieved. No report to that effect has been narrated from the earliest generations. Rather the woman should check before she goes to sleep, and at the times of the daily prayers, so she should check before the sun rises, and between Zuhr and ‘Asr, and so on.\nAl-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Chapter on the beginning and end of menses … The daughter of Zayd ibn Thabit heard that women were calling for lamps in the depths of the night to see whether their menses had ended. She said: The women never used to do that, and she rebuked them. End quote.\nThis report was also narrated by Malik in al-Muwatta’.\nIbn ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The daughter of Zayd ibn Thabit only rebuked the women for checking on their status when it was not the time for prayer and the time for prayer was not approaching because the depths of the night is not a time for obligatory prayer, and women are only required to check on their status for the purpose of praying, so that if their menses has ended, they can do ghusl, because they are obliged to pray.\nEnd quote from Fath al-Bari by Ibn Rajab al-Hanbali (1/491).\nAl-Khurashi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Sharh Mukhtasar Khalil (1/207): She does not have to check whether her menses has ended before Fajr; rather she should check when going to sleep and in the morning. In other words, during her menses and afterwards, the menstruating woman does not have to check whether her menses has ended before Fajr. That is neither obligatory nor recommended; rather it is disliked (makruh). She should check when going to sleep and at the time of each of the daily prayers, but what is required is to allow enough time so that she can do ghusl and offer her obligatory prayer. End quote.\nSo if she realises after Fajr that her period has ended, but she is not sure whether it ended before or after Fajr, she should pray Fajr only, and does not have to pray Maghrib and ‘Isha’. If she fasts on that day, it is not valid, because there is no certainty that her period had ended before Fajr.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/138693/is-the-menstruating-woman-required-to-check-whether-her-period-has-ended-before-fajr
227879,"I did Hajj, following what others were doing, several years ago, i.e., I had not learned all the rituals and the order in which they were to be done. Allah blessed me by enabling me to do `Umrah before Hajj. I remember that we started Tawaf on the upper level, and I was following my family and doing what they did. I did not realise that we had started Tawaf at first; in other words, I started to perform the ritual without realising what I was doing, and for a little while I thought that we were still walking in the midst of the crowd. Does that affect the validity of the act of worship, or is this waswas?","['Praise be to Allah.It is not essential to form a specific intention for Tawaf or Sa`i or any of the rituals of Hajj; rather the general intention is sufficient, namely the intention to perform Hajj or `Umrah when entering Ihram.\nAl-Hafidh Jalal Ad-Din As-Suyuti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“With regard to acts of worship that are composed of several actions, it is sufficient to form the intention at the beginning, and there is no need for a new intention for each action, because the initial intention includes all of that. This applies to acts of worship such as Wudu and prayer, and also Hajj. There is no need to form a specific intention for Tawaf , Sa`i and standing (in `Arafah), according to the more correct opinion.” (Al-Ashbah wan-Nadha’ir by As-Suyuti, p. 27)\nShaykh Muhammad Al-Amin Ash-Shinqiti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“It should be understood that the scholarly view that is most likely to be correct, in sha Allah, is that Tawaf does not need a specific intention, because the intention to perform Hajj is sufficient and includes it. This applies to all the actions of Hajj, such as standing in `Arafah, staying overnight in Muzdalifah, Sa`i and stoning the Jamarat. None of these actions requires a specific intention, because the intention to perform Hajj includes all of them. This is the view of most of the scholars, and the evidence for that is clear, because the intention to perform an act of worship includes all of its parts. Just as there is no need for a specific intention for every bow and prostration in the prayer, because the intention to pray includes all of that, by the same token there is no need for a specific intention for each of the actions of Hajj, because the intention to perform Hajj includes all of them.\nOne of the things that the scholars quoted as evidence for that is the fact that if a person were to stand in `Arafah without realising where he is, it would still be valid, according to scholarly consensus. This was stated by An-Nawawi.\nIn addition to the view that is correct, in sha Allah, there are two other scholarly views:\nThe first is the view of Abu `Ali ibn Abu Hurayrah, who was a Shafi`i; this view states that specific actions such as Tawaf, Sa`i and stoning the Jamarat require a specific intention, and matters that do not require a specific action, and simply involve staying in a place, such as standing in `Arafah and staying overnight in Muzdalifah, do not require a specific intention.\nThe second view is that of Abu Is-haq Al-Marwazi, which is that none of the actions of Hajj require a specific intention except Tawaf , because it is a form of prayer, and there should be an intention for prayer.\nHowever, the view that is most likely to be correct, in sha Allah, is the first one, which is the view of the majority.” (Adwa’ Al-Bayan fi Idah Al-Qur’an bil-Qur’an, 4/414)\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“This is an important matter. The intention should be formed immediately before doing the act of worship, and it is recommended to be aware of this intention throughout the prayer. This is preferable, so that the intention will accompany the deed at every stage thereof. This is what is best, but if it slips your mind during the prayer, does that harm you or not? No, it does not harm you because your action is based on the initial intention.\nHence many of the scholars – including Shaykh Muhammad Ash-Shinqiti (may Allah have mercy on him) – were of the view that it is not essential to form the intention for Tawaf or Sa`i, because Tawaf and Sa`i are part of an act of worship. Just as you do not form a specific intention to bow or prostrate in the prayer – because your general intention of performing prayer at the beginning is sufficient – by the same token, with regard to Tawaf and Sa`i, and other parts of the acts of worship, from the time you said Labbayk `Umratan [In response to Your call, here I am for `Umrah] at the Miqat, you had already formed the intention to do all the acts of `Umrah.\nMoreover, this is easier for people. Many people – especially when it is very crowded – enter the Sacred House and start Tawaf, and they forget to form a specific intention to perform the Tawaf of `Umrah or any other kind of Tawaf, so if we affirm that Tawaf and Sa`i are like bowing and prostration in the prayer, and that the general intention includes them both, this will make things much easier for people. This is the view of many of the scholars, and it is the view that we favour. In fact many people get overwhelmed, especially when they see the huge numbers of people [in the Haram], so they enter the mosque with the intention of doing Tawaf , without bringing to mind whether it is for Hajj or `Umrah, but they still formed the intention of doing Tawaf, because they came in order to do Tawaf.” (Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin’s commentary on Al-Kafi, 1/384)\nBased on the above, your Tawaf was valid and you do not have to do anything else.\nIf what happened to you was simply that you were uncertain after having finished the act of worship, then no attention is to be paid to this uncertainty, because uncertainty after having done an act of worship is of no significance, and it comes under the heading of Waswas from the Shaytan .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/227879/is-it-essential-to-form-a-specific-intention-for-tawaf
111777,We know that there will be wives in Paradise; will there be any pregnancy and childbirth?,"['Praise be to Allah.Can you have children in Jannah?\nSome of the scholars are of the view that if a person wishes to have a child in Paradise, Allah will fulfil that wish for him. They quoted as evidence for that the report narrated by At-Tirmidhi (2563) in his Sunan from Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If the believer wishes for a child in Paradise, the pregnancy, birth and growth will occur within an hour, as he wishes.” (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Al-Jami`, 6649)\xa0\nWhat is meant is that the pregnancy will occur and the child will be born and will grow to the age of perfection, which is thirty years, as the person wishes, i.e., the child will be male or female and so on, in accordance with the person’s wishes.\xa0\nThis is the view of many of the scholars.\xa0\nSome of the scholars said that in Paradise there will be intercourse but there will be no children. This view was narrated from Tawus, Muhajid and Ibrahim An-Nakha`i (may Allah have mercy on them).\xa0\nImam Al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It was narrated from Abu Razin Al-`Uqayli that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The people of Paradise will not have children there.”\xa0\nThe Hadith referred to by Al-Bukhari was narrated by Imam Ahmad (15773) from Abu Razin Al-`Uqayli (may Allah be pleased with him) in a lengthy Hadith in which it says “The righteous women will be for the righteous man, you will enjoy them as you enjoyed them in this world, and they will enjoy you, but you will not produce children.”\xa0\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “It has the dignity and light of Prophethood which suggests that it is authentic. However it was classed as inauthentic by Al-Albani in Zalal Al-Jannah, and Shu`ayb Al-Arna’ut said: “Its chain of narrators is weak and is a series of unknown narrators.”\xa0\nThe Hadith clearly states that there will be no childbirth, but there is a difference of opinion as to its soundness.\xa0\nWith regard to the Hadith of Abu Sa`id (may Allah be pleased with him), “If the believer wishes for a child in Paradise, the pregnancy, birth and growth will occur within an hour, as he wishes”, it was noted that its soundness is subject to further discussion. Hence Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said concerning it: “Its chain of narrators meets the conditions of soundness, but it is very strange.” (Hadi Al-Arwah, p. 213)\xa0\nAnd he said: With regard to this Hadith of Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri, the best of its chain of narrators is that of At-Tirmidhi, who determined that it is strange and that it is only known from the Hadith of Abu’s-Siddiq an-Naji, and the wording of the Hadith is not sound.”\nImam Ishaq ibn Rahawayh (may Allah have mercy on him) said concerning the Hadith of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), “If the believer wishes for a child in Paradise, the pregnancy, birth and growth will occur within an hour, as he wishes”: But he will not wish. What is meant by the words of Ishaq is that the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), “If the believer wishes …” are hypothetical) i.e., if the believer were to wish, but in fact he will not wish).\xa0\nWhy will there be no childbirth in Paradise?\nIbn Al-Qayyim mentioned a number of reasons why it is most likely that there will be no childbirth in Paradise, such as the following:\xa0\n\nThe Hadith of Ibn Razin\nThe words of Allah, may He be Exalted (interpretation of the meaning): “Therein they shall have Azwajun Mutahharatun (purified mates or wives)” [An-Nisa’ 4:57]. They are the ones who have been purified from menses, Nifas (postpartum bleeding) and so on.\n\nIt was narrated that Mujahid said: Purified from menses, stools, urine, sputum, spitting, maniy and childbirth.\n\nAllah, may He be Glorified, made pregnancy and childbirth along with\xa0 menses and maniy; if women were to become pregnant in Paradise, menses and other discharges would not cease for them.\nIt is proven that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There will remain in Paradise surplus space, and Allah will create a creation for it and cause them to inhabit it (the surplus space).” (Narrated by Muslim, 5085) If there were to be childbirth in Paradise, then this surplus space would be for those who would be born there, and they would be more entitled to it than others.\nAllah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And those who believe and whose offspring follow them in Faith, to them shall We join their offspring” [At-Tur 52:21]. Here He tells us that He will honour them by joining them to their offspring that they had in this world. If they were to have offspring in Paradise, Allah would have referred to them as He referred to their worldly offspring, because they would be delighted with them (the hypothetical offspring in Paradise) as they were delighted with their children in this world (i.e., the fact that He mentioned only the worldly offspring indicates that there will be no offspring in Paradise).\nEither we say that there will be ongoing procreation in Paradise or that it will continue until some point, then cease. But both ideas are impossible, because the former implies endless birth of new individuals, whilst the latter implies the end of one of the pleasures of the people of Paradise, and that is impossible. And we cannot say that there will be procreation and people will die to be succeeded by others, because there is no death there.\nPeople will not grow in Paradise as they did in this world, so the children of its people will not grow and become bigger, and the men will not grow. Rather these children will remain small and will not change, and the adults will be thirty-three years old and will not change either. If there were any childbirth in Paradise, then the child would have to grow until it became an adult. It is well known that children who die will reach the age of thirty-three without growing.\xa0\n\nThen he said: Paradise is not the realm of procreation; rather it is the place of eternal abode and those who are in it will never die and be replaced by their offspring.” (Hadi Al-Arwah, 1/173)\xa0\nFor more details, please refer to the following answers: 5981 , 20469 , and 149336 ,\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/111777/can-you-have-kids-in-jannah
