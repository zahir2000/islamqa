111913,"A company has a large amount of money left over in their budget, which it gives to its employees as a reward for doing extra work, and the employees sign for that and receive it by turns each year, even though they did not do any extra work. Is it permissible to accept this money?","['Praise be to Allah.Those in charge of this company should not mess about with this wealth, and they should put any surplus back into the company’s coffers. That is because this money was allocated to cover expenditures, so if the expenditures did not consume it all, it is not permissible to give it to someone who did not do any work. Rather they must return it, even if that means that they will not pay them extra in the following year or in other years. That is because they are entrusted with it, and the one who is entrusted with something must be honest with what was entrusted to him. If they need extra work to be done outside regular hours, then employees can do that work, and then be given as much as they deserve.\nHowever, for the employees, if the managers of that department decide to do it in this way and give them money in this basis, they can accept it, based on what is mentioned in the hadith, that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him): “Whatever wealth comes to you when you are not hoping for it or asking for it, then take it, otherwise do not hope for it.” End quote.\nShaykh ‘Abdullah ibn Jibril (may Allah preserve him).\nFatawa ‘Ulama’ al-Balad al-Haram (p. 357).']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/111913/the-company-gave-them-money-for-extra-work-even-though-they-did-not-do-it
93519,"How can I reconcile between being a modern teenage girl and a girl who pleases her family and is loved by all, and how can I rid myself of a friend whom I do not like and I cannot find any way to like her?","['Praise be to Allah.You should note that the stage of adolescence is the most sensitive stage that a person goes through, because during this stage there are many physical, mental, emotional and sexual changes, and the shaytan is keen to tempt a person during this stage by whatever means and methods he can. Hence every adolescent boy and girl must be cautious. What we recommend at this stage is:\xa0\nHow to be a good Muslim girl\n\nStrive to do acts of worship, both obligatory and mustahabb, and strive to keep away from haram (impermissible), doubtful and makruh (disliked) things.\xa0\n\nAmong the means which will help you to avoid falling into the trap of the shaytan and keep away from disobedience to Allah are:\xa0\n\nRemembering that Allah is always watching and bearing in mind His greatness, especially when you are alone.\nNot following in the footsteps of the shaytan . Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “O you who believe! Follow not the footsteps of Shaytan (Satan). And whosoever follows the footsteps of Shaytan (Satan), then, verily, he commands Al-Fahsha’ [i.e. to commit indecency (illegal sexual intercourse)], and Al-Munkar [disbelief and polytheism (i.e. to do evil and wicked deeds; and to speak or to do what is forbidden in Islam)]” [al-Nur 24:21]. The steps of the shaytan are like a chain; the one who follows them will not stop and each step is more serious than the one that came before it, unless a person checks himself and gives it up and repents from every sin.\nRepenting from every sin . A Muslim may fall into sin, but if that happens what he must do is give it up and repent, and not continue and persist in it. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And those who, when they have committed Fahishah (illegal sexual intercourse) or wronged themselves with evil, remember Allah and ask forgiveness for their sins; — and none can forgive sins but Allah — and do not persist in what (wrong) they have done, while they know” [Aal ‘Imran 3:135]. And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Every son of Adam commits sin, and the best of those who commit sin are those who repent.” Narrated by Ibn Majah (4251).\xa0 Shaykh al-Albani said: It is hasan.\nThinking of death and the meeting with Allah. The one who remembers that death may come to him suddenly and that he will meet Allah, Who will ask him about his deeds, will avoid sin.\nTurning to Allah and praying that He will help you to do good deeds and give up evil deeds, for Allah will never let down the one who calls upon Him. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And when My slaves ask you (O Muhammad) concerning Me, then (answer them), I am indeed near (to them by My Knowledge). I respond to the invocations of the supplicant when he calls on Me (without any mediator or intercessor). So let them obey Me and believe in Me, so that they may be led aright” [al-Baqarah 2:186].\n\n\nStrive to find good companions and keep away from bad companions, for a friend will have an impact on his friends, as it was said:\n\nDo not ask about a man, rather ask about his friend, for every friend follows the example of his friends.\xa0\n\nYou should fill your time with beneficial and useful things, both religious and worldly, and beware of free time for it is one of the greatest sources of corruption at this stage.\xa0\nIf you want to win people’s hearts, then treat them kindly and have a good attitude towards them, cooperate with them and meet their needs, for in this way you will be able to win their hearts. \xa0\n\nAmong the wisdom narrated from ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) are his words:\xa0\nDo favours to whoever you want and you will be like his master, and be in need of whoever you want and you will be like his prisoner, and be independent of whoever you want and you will be his equal. \xa0\nWe will say something in general terms about winning people’s hearts and earning their love.\xa0\nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Verily, those who believe [in the Oneness of Allah and in His Messenger (Muhammad )] and work deeds of righteousness, the Most Gracious (Allah) will bestow love for them(in the hearts of the believers)”\xa0[Maryam 19:96]\nQatadah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his commentary on this verse: This means, by Allah, in the hearts of the believers. It was mentioned to us that Haram ibn Hayyan used to say: No person turns with all his heart to Allah but Allah will turn the hearts of the believers towards him, until He blesses him with their love and compassion. Tafsir al-Tabari (18/266).\xa0\nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When Allah loves a person, He calls Jibril (A) and says: ‘I love So and So, so love him.’ So Jibril loves him, then he calls out to the people of heaven, ‘Allah loves So and So, so love him.’ So the people of heaven love him and he finds acceptance on earth. If Allah hates someone, He calls Jibril and says: ‘I hate So and So, so hate him.’ So Jibril hates him, then he calls out to the people of heaven: ‘Allah hates So and So, so hate him.’ So they hate him and he is hated on earth.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (7485) and Muslim (2637).\xa0\nNow you see that winning people’s hearts and earning their love is not within your capacity or that of any other human being, rather it is in the Hand of Allah Alone, may He be glorified and exalted. He is the One Who softens hearts towards one another and He is the One Who separates them. He is the One Who gives and withholds, lowers and raises. All of this is part and parcel of His being the Rabb (Lord or Cherisher and Sustainer) of His creation, may He be glorified.\xa0\nHow to attain the love of Allah\nAs for how to attain the love of Allah , this is the greatest desire of the believer, and this is the great and noble purpose for which there is only one way to attain it, which is by following and obeying His Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him). Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Say (O Muhammad to mankind): “If you (really) love Allah, then follow me (i.e. accept Islamic Monotheism, follow the Quran and the Sunnah), Allah will love you and forgive you your sins. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful”\xa0[Aal ‘Imran 3:31]\nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said that Allah said: “Whosoever shows enmity to someone devoted to Me (wali), I shall be at war with him. My slave draws not near to Me with anything more loved by Me than the religious duties I have enjoined upon him, and My slave continues to draw near to Me with supererogatory works so that I shall love him. When I love him I am his hearing with which he hears, his seeing with which he sees, his hand with which he strikes and his foot with which he walks. Were he to ask [something] of Me, I would surely give it to him, and were he to ask Me for refuge, I would surely grant him it. I do not hesitate about anything as much as I hesitate about [seizing] the soul of My faithful slave: he hates death and I hate hurting him.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (6502).\xa0\nIf there remain after that people of evil and corruption who love to spread evil among those who believe, and they want to harm you, and want you to agree with them, and are annoyed by your obedience to the Most Merciful, and your keenness to worship Him and attain all the branches of faith, then do not pay any attention to them, and continue on your straight path, and be with His righteous slaves.\xa0\nHere we should point out the importance of respecting parents and relatives , for they are the most deserving of good treatment and of your efforts to win their hearts. It is essential to be patient with parents when they regard you as still being young, because no matter how old you get, you are still young in your parents’ eyes. Moreover they have the right of being in charge of you, looking after you, raising and teaching you, and disciplining you. They are entrusted with your care, and are responsible for you in this world and in the Hereafter. Part of their duty is that they should ensure that you follow proper etiquette and pay attention to the rulings of Islam, and respect the people’s customs and traditions so long as they do not go against shari’ah. All of that may conflict with the desires and inclinations of teenagers, which may lead to the situation that you describe, and you feel that it is a problem, i.e., reconciling between what is required of you as a teenager and the whims and desires of your own nafs (desirous soul), and what the duties of etiquette demand of you, and what your parents’ rights dictate, that you should respect and accept the guardianship of your parents. \xa0\nHence you will know the answer to the rest of your question. If this friend is a good person, then try to love her and grow close to her, and if she is a bad and corrupt person, then keep away from her and she will also keep away from you.\xa0\n“Bad statements are for bad people (or bad women for bad men) and bad people for bad statements (or bad men for bad women). Good statements are for good people (or good women for good men) and good people for good statements (or good men for good women): such (good people) are innocent of (every) bad statement which they say; for them is forgiveness, and Rizqun Karim (generous provision, i.e. Paradise)”\xa0[Al-Nur 24:26].\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/93519/how-to-be-a-good-muslim-girl
393945,"Regarding the sales representative who sells to pharmacies only, there are offers for all types of medicines, whereby if the pharmacist orders ten pieces of a particular medicine, he will be given two for free, and the number of free items will vary from one company to another. Sometimes there is competition in this regard, whereby the representative will try to give additional free items to the pharmacist so that he will order from him. What is the ruling on that?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThere is nothing wrong with pharmaceutical companies offering discounts on the price of medicines to pharmacies, or offering free medicines when the pharmacy purchases a specific amount, by way of encouraging the pharmacies to buy from them.\nIbn Rushd said: Some scholars are of the view, based on their interpretation of this report of Ibn al-Qasim and similar reports, that one or two of the merchants in the marketplace do not have the right to sell goods more cheaply than the other merchants, because that harming them. Among those who hold this view are Abu Muhammad ‘Abd al-Wahhab ibn Nasr al-Baghdadi, but this view is clearly wrong, because no one should be blamed for being easy-going in selling and lowering prices; rather he is to be thanked for that, if he does it for the sake of people, and he will be rewarded for that if he does it for the sake of Allah.""(Al-Bayan wa’l-Tahsil\xa0\xa09/306).\nSecondly:\nFrom a juristic (fiqhi) perspective regarding the gifts that salesmen offer for marketing purposes, we have previously explained that the best of what has been said concerning that from a juristic perspective is one of two scenarios:\nThe first scenario is that it is a pure gift that the seller gives to encourage the purchaser to buy his product, and the buyer accepts it as such – that is, as a gift – and the price does not change as a result.\nThe second scenario is that it is part of the sales deal, and is subject to the general rulings on buying and selling.\nWe have previously mentioned these two ways of looking at it, and explained that the second one is the better way to look at this issue, in the answer to question no. 385767.\nFor more information, please see also the answer to question no. 194359 .\nThirdly:\nThe sales rep has no right to do that without the permission of his company, because he is in a position of trust regarding the pharmaceutical products that he has in his possession, and the way in which he handles them is subject to permission.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The proxy does not have the right to dispose of anything except in accordance with what is dictated by the permission given by the one who appointed him, either based on what he said to him or based on what is acceptable according to custom, because his handling of it is based on the permission of the owner, so it is limited to what he has permitted.

14250,"Why do we have to love, obey, follow and venerate our Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) the most (or more than any other person)?","[""Praise be to Allah.Muslims love Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) the most for the following reasons:\n\nAllah has commanded us to obey the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n\n“And obey Allah and the Messenger (Muhammad), and beware (of evil) and fear Allah. Then if you turn away, you should know that it is Our Messenger’s duty to convey (the Message) in the clearest way.”\xa0[Al-Ma'idah 5:92]\n\nAllah has told us that obedience to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is obedience to Allah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n\n“He who obeys the Messenger (Muhammad), has indeed obeyed Allah, but he who turns away, then we have not sent you (O Muhammad) as a watcher over them.”\xa0[An-Nisa’ 4:80]\xa0\n\nAllah has warned us against failing to obey him, and that this may lead a Muslim into a trial that is the trial of Shirk (associating partners with Allah). Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Do not make [your] calling of the Messenger among yourselves as the call of one of you to another. Already Allāh knows those of you who slip away, concealed by others. So let those who dissent from his [i.e., the Prophet's] order [way or sunnah] beware , lest fitnah [trials or affliction] strike them or a painful punishment..”\xa0[An-Nur 24:63]\xa0\xa0\xa0\n\nAllah has told us that the status of Prophethood which He gave to His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) requires the believers to respect and venerate the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“Verily, We have sent you (O Muhammad) as a witness, as a bearer of glad tidings, and as a warner. In order that you (O mankind) may believe in Allah and His Messenger, and that you assist and honour him, and (that you) glorify (Allah’s) praises morning and afternoon.”\xa0[Al-Fath 48:8-9]\xa0\n\nThe Muslim’s faith cannot be complete unless he loves the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and until the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is dearer to him than his father, his son, his own self and all the people. It was narrated that Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No one of you will truly believe until I am dearer to him than his father, his son, his own self and all the people.”\xa0(Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 15; Muslim, 44).\xa0\n\n`Abdullah ibn Hisham (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “We were with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when he was holding the hand of `Umar ibn Al-Khattab. `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said to him: “O Messenger of Allah, you are dearer to me than everything except my own self.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No, by the One in Whose hand is my soul, (you will not have complete faith) not until I am dearer to you than your own self.” `Umar said to him: “Now, by Allah, you are dearer to me than my own self.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Now (you are a true believer), O `Umar.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 6257)\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“The reason why it is obligatory to love the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and venerate him more than any other person is that we cannot attain what is good in this world and in the Hereafter except through the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), by believing in him and following him. That is because no one can be saved from the punishment of Allah, and the mercy of Allah cannot reach him except by means of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), by believing in him, loving him, being loyal to him and following him. This is the means by which Allah will save him from punishment in this world and in the Hereafter. This is the means by which he will attain what is good in this world and in the Hereafter. The greatest blessing is the blessing of faith, which can only be attained through him, and which is more beneficial (to the person) than his own self and his wealth. He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the one by means of whom Allah brings people forth from darkness into light, and there is no other way to Allah. As for a person’s self and family, they will not avail him anything before Allah…” (Majmu’ Al-Fatawa, 27/246)\xa0\nOne of the scholars said:\n“If a person thinks of the benefits that he has been given through the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), through whom Allah brought him forth from the darkness of disbelief into the light of faith, he will realise that he is the cause of his soul will remain forever in eternal bliss, and he will understand that this benefit is greater than all others. So he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) deserves that his share of a person’s love should be greater than anyone else’s. However, people vary with regard to that, depending on the extent to which they bear that in mind or neglect it. Everyone who truly believes in the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) will inevitably have a strong love for him , but they differ in the extent and depth of their love for him. Some of them have a great deal of love for him and some have only a little, like those who are absorbed in their own whims and desires most of the time. But when mention of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is made, most of them long to see him, and prefer that over their own family, sons, wealth and fathers. But that feeling quickly fades because of other distractions. And Allah is the One Whose help we seek.”\xa0 (See Fath Al-Bari, 1/59)\xa0\nThis is what is referred to in the verse where Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“The Prophet is closer to the believers than their own selves.”\xa0[Al-Ahzab 33:6]\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“[Allah] knew how compassionate His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was towards his Ummah, and how sincere he was towards them, so He made him closer to them than their own selves, and decreed that his judgement among them should take precedence over their own preferences.” (Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 6/380)\xa0\nShaykh Ibn Sa’di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Allah tells the believers something by which they may understand the position and status of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), so that they might interact with him appropriately. So He said: “The Prophet is closer to the believers than their own selves”, the closest thing to a person and the most deserving of love is his own self. Yet, the Messenger is closer to him than his own self, because he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was so kind and sincere and compassionate towards the believers. He was the kindest and most merciful of mankind. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did the greatest of favours to all of mankind. Not the slightest good came to them and not the slightest harm was warded off from them except through him. Hence if there is a conflict between what a person himself wants or what other people want, and what the Messenger wants, then what the Messenger wants must take precedence. What the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) says cannot be overridden by what any person says, no matter who he is. They should sacrifice their selves, their wealth and their children, and put love for him before their love for all others.”\xa0\nWhat the scholars have said may be summed up by noting that the wrath of Allah and the Fire of Hell are the things that we fear the most, and we cannot be saved from them except through the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The pleasure of Allah and the garden of Paradise are the things that we want the most, but we cannot attain them except through the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).\xa0\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) referred to the former (i.e., being saved from Hell) when he said: “The likeness of me and you is that of a man who lit a fire and grasshoppers and moths started falling into it, and he tried to push them away. I am seizing your waistbands and trying to pull you away from the Fire but you are trying to get away from me.”\xa0(Muslim, 2285, from the Hadith of Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him); a similar Hadith was narrated by Al-Bukhari, 3427 from the Hadith of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him)).\xa0\nWhat is meant by this Hadith is that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) likened the way in which the ignorant and disobedient rush to fall into the Fire of the Hereafter by means of their sins and following their whims and desires, and their keenness to fall into that Fire, even though he is trying hard to prevent them from doing so, to the way in which moths and other insects are fatally attracted to the fire. Both of them are keen to destroy themselves because of their ignorance of the consequences.\xa0(Sharh Muslim by An-Nawawi)\xa0\nThe latter (i.e., entering Paradise) was referred to by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when he said: “All of my Ummah will enter Paradise except those who refuse.” They said: “O Messenger of Allah, who would refuse?” He said: “Whoever obeys me will enter Paradise and whoever disobeys me has refused.”\xa0(Al-Bukhari, 7280, from the Hadith of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him))""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/14250/why-must-we-love-the-prophet-muhammad
