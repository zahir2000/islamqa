374172,"My question is about new conditions that are stipulated by the YouTube website, which we received two weeks ago. As a content creator, we have no choice but to accept them. One of the clauses gives YouTube the right to put ads on my videos and make money from that, even without my consent, and without me subscribing to the advertising program (the profits go to the owners of YouTube only, and not to me, but the issue of helping in sin and transgression is still there, because the followers of my channel will see the YouTube ads that are filled with things that are contrary to Islamic teachings). What is the ruling on posting my content on YouTube in the future, and what is the ruling on leaving my old videos there, because all the content will be affected by the ads? Please advise us, thank you.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIn principle, it is not allowed to take part in or contribute to posting any ads that contain or promote anything objectionable, because posting that is helping to spread sin and exposing the viewers to seeing sin, and Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {And cooperate in righteousness and piety, but do not cooperate in sin and transgression. And fear Allah; indeed, Allah is severe in penalty} [al-Ma’idah 5:2].\nBased on that, if it is possible for the content creator to prevent ads altogether, or to prevent the ads which he thinks are most likely to contain objectionable material, even if that is by paying a monthly subscription that he can afford without suffering harm, then he must do that, and it is not permissible for him to allow ads to appear on his content, and what that could lead to of spreading mischief.\nSimilar to that, if shar‘i interests can be achieved by posting his content on another website, that does not require him to have these ads and other evils, then he should move to that website and should not take part in supporting websites in which there is a great deal of evil. If it is not possible to prevent ads, or to have any control over them, even by paying money that the content creator can afford, and the content he posts is beneficial and posting it on YouTube serves a greater interest, then what appears to be the case is that there is no blame on him for that, and the sin of the objectionable material is only on those who make and post it. The greater interest served by your content, such as teaching people, benefitting them, calling them to Islam and guiding them, should not be abandoned because of something objectionable in the ads. That is for the following reasons:\n\nThe ads that appear in video clips are a widespread problem and it is difficult to avoid it except with great hardship.\nThe channel owner or producer of videos has nothing to do with the ads and has no control over them and no ability to limit them.\nRefraining from posting will leave more room for others to post evil and trivial content.\nSeeking to crowd out falsehood and outnumber such material by posting useful and beneficial videos, or even those that are merely permissible, is a valid objective according to Islamic teachings\n\nAl-Shatibi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: With regard to basic activities that are, in principle, allowed in Islam, if they involve some infractions – such as buying and selling, mixing with people and living among them – when mischief has become widespread in the land and evil activities have increased and become normalized, such that when the accountable person is going about his business to meet his needs and do other ordinary, daily activities, he will in most cases be unable to avoid coming across some infractions and evils… If we realise that refraining from going about one’s business could cause undue hardship to a person and impose on him restrictions that he cannot bear, that is something for which this ummah is excused. In that case, the individual has no choice but to carry on, but he must refrain from whatever he can refrain from, and anything else may be overlooked, because his excuse is due to his situation, not because these things are acceptable in principle.""(Al-Muwafaqat\xa0 3/526-527).\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf a man in a position of leadership does what is required of him, of enjoining what is right, forbidding what is wrong, striving in jihad, doing what is required of a man in a position of authority, and so on, then he will inevitably commit some infractions. What is required of him is to see which of the two matters is dominant. If what is enjoined in Islamic teachings will bring greater reward than refraining from the infractions, then he should not give up his position because of what he fears of falling into infractions which are outweighed by the benefits. But if refraining from infractions will bring him greater reward, he should not miss out on that reward in the hope of getting reward for doing obligatory actions that bring less reward. This issue should be judged by comparing and weighing up the good deeds and bad deeds in both scenarios. This is how the matter should be examined, but explaining that in detail would take too long.""(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa\xa0 28/168).\nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 119222 .\nSecondly:\nEveryone who watches video clips on YouTube or elsewhere should take whatever he can of measures to help prevent these ads appearing. This is possible by using some programs or other ways that are known to experts, and you can easily obtain them.\nThirdly:\nThe money that the channel owner or publisher of videos earns because of the ads is mixed wealth, some of which is halal and some is haram. He must work out the proportion of it that is haram, based on what he thinks is most likely to be the case, and get rid of it by giving it in charity to the poor and needy. If he cannot work it out precisely, he should work out what is most likely to absolve him of responsibility.\nFourthly:\nAs for those who publish content that is of no benefit and has nothing to do with what people need in their religious or worldly affairs, and have no aim except to make money from ads, it is not permissible for them to pursue this method of earning money, because it is profit that is tainted by committing haram, and there is no interest that could equal or outweigh the mischief involved, such that a concession could be granted to do that.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/374172/ruling-on-posting-videos-on-youtube-with-ads-that-appear-and-one-has-no-control-over-their-content
235370,"Is living in the city of the Messenger of Allah better, or living in Makkah Al-Mukarramah? What are the differences that make one of the two cities better than the other, apart from the difference of virtue of praying in the two Harams?","['Praise be to Allah.Which city is the best for living as a Muslim?\nThe best spot on earth, in and of itself, is Makkah, then Madinah.\nWith regard to individuals, what is best for each person is to live in the city where his faith will increase and he will be able to worship and obey Allah, may He be Exalted, more.\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“The best place on earth for each individual is the land where he will be more able to obey Allah and His Messenger, which varies according to circumstances. There is no specific land in which it is best for a person to reside. Rather what is best for each individual is to be determined based on the degree to which he will be able to attain piety, obedience, humility before Allah, submission and focus on worship. Abu Ad-Darda’ (may Allah be pleased with him) wrote to Salman (may Allah be pleased with him), saying: Come to the holy land. Salman wrote to him: The land does not sanctify anyone; rather what sanctifies a person is his deeds.” (Majmoo‘ Al-Fatawa, 18/283)\nVirtues of Makkah\xa0\nMakkah is distinct from Madinah and other cities because of a number of virtues, of which we will mention the following:\n\nOne prayer in Al-Masjid Al-Haram in Makkah is better than one hundred thousand prayers offered in any other mosque, except Al-Masjid An-Nabawi [the Prophet’s mosque], in which one prayer is better than a thousand prayers offered elsewhere.\nMakkah is unique in that it is the place where Hajj and ‘Umrah are performed, people circumambulate the Ka‘bah, touch the Black Stone and the Yemeni Corner (Ar-Rukn Al-Yamani), and do Sa‘i between As-Safa and Al-Marwah.\nAllah, may He be Exalted, swears by it, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): “I swear by this city (Makkah)” [Al-Balad 90:1].\nAllah, may He be Exalted, decreed Makkah to be a sanctuary the day He created the heavens and the earth, which is not the case with Madinah.\nThe sanctity of Makkah is greater than that of Madinah.\xa0\n\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Madinah is a sanctuary and enjoys sanctity, but its sanctity is much less than that of Makkah. No Muslim can come to the sanctuary of Makkah from outside the Haram boundary, unless he is in the state of Ihram, and he must enter Ihram. That is not so in the case of Madinah.\nIn the sanctuary of Makkah, the grass and trees (i.e., all plants) are protected, whereas in the sanctuary of Madinah, a concession is granted regarding some of its trees for the purpose of agriculture and the like.\nHunting game in Makkah is prohibited, and a penalty must be paid for that, whereas no penalty is required for hunting game in Madinah.\nThe point is that the safest place is Makkah, where even the trees are safe, and even game animals are safe.” (Liqa’ Al-Bab Al-Maftooh, 103/2)\nVirtues of Madinah\n\nMadinah is the location of Hijrah (migration), the place where the Muhajirin and Ansar came together. And it is the centre of Jihad, from which the armies marched forth and campaigns were launched, from which lands were conquered, the religion spread and Shirk and its people were defeated.\nIn Madinah, most of the verses on rulings and laws were revealed. When the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) conquered Makkah, he did not settle there; rather he returned to Madinah, the city to which he had migrated, and lived there until he died and was buried in that city.\n\nAl-Bukhari (3778) and Muslim (1059) narrated that Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Ansar said on the day of the conquest of Makkah, when (the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) gave (some of the booty) to Quraysh: By Allah, this is strange. Our swords are still dripping with the blood of Quraysh, and our spoils have been given to them! News of that reached the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), so he summoned the Ansar and said: “What is this that I have heard about you?” They were people who never told lies, so they said: It is what you have heard. He (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Does it not please you that the people are going back to their houses with worldly gains whilst you are going back to your houses with the Messenger of Allah? If the Ansar were to follow a valley or mountain pass, I would follow the valley or mountain pass of the Ansar.”\nAl-Bukhari (1871) and Muslim (1382) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “I have been enjoined (to go to) a city which supersedes other cities. They say Yathrib, but it is Madinah. It purifies people as the bellows eliminates the impurities of iron.”\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“With regard to it superseding all other cities, they mentioned two meanings, the first of which is that it was the centre for the armies of Islam in the beginning, and from it other cities were conquered and their wealth and captives seized. The second meaning is that it superseded and its food and provision came to it from the conquered cities, from which booty was brought to it.” (Sharh An-Nawawi ‘Ala Muslim, 9/154)\nAl-Bukhari (1876) and Muslim (147) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Faith will retreat to Madinah as a snake retreats to its hole.” (Mirqat Al-Mafateeh, 1/243)\nMadinah is the gathering-point of the Muslims in the beginning and at the end. An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Faith will retreat to Madinah” – what is meant is that this is how faith is in the beginning and at the end, because at the beginning of Islam, everyone whose faith was sincere and whose Islam was valid came to Madinah, either as a Muhajir (migrant) coming to settle there, or out of a longing to see the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and to learn from him and be near to him; then after that, at the time of the caliphs, people did the same, so they came to learn about the straight path from them and follow the example of the majority of the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) living there; then after that, they came to learn from the scholars of Madinah who were a shining lamp of that era, and the Imams of guidance, to learn Islam and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that the Companions narrated to subsequent generations…. Therefore everyone who was steadfast in faith and at ease with it would travel there. “ (Sharh An-Nawawi ‘Ala Muslim, 2/177)\n\nIn Madinah there is the Prophet’s Mosque and the blessed Rawdah. Al-Bukhari (1196) and Muslim (1391) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The area between my house and my minbar is one of the gardens of Paradise, and my minbar is upon my cistern (Hawd).”\n\nIn it is the valley of Al-‘Aqiq, which is a blessed valley. Al-Bukhari (1534) narrated from Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that he heard ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) say: I heard the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) saying in the valley of Al-‘Aqiq: “Last night someone came to me from my Lord and said: ‘Pray in this blessed valley, and say: (I intend to do) ‘Umrah and Hajj.’”\n\nNo one intends ill towards the people of Madinah but Allah will destroy him.\n\nAl-Bukhari (1877) and Muslim (1363) narrated that Sa‘d (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “No one plots against the people of Madinah but Allah will cause him to dissolve as salt dissolves in water.”\nWhomever Allah blesses by causing him to live in Makkah, congratulations to him; and whomever Allah blesses by causing him to live in Madinah, congratulations to him; and whomever Allah blesses with piety – no matter where on Allah’s earth he lives – congratulations to him.\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 146927 , 228704 , 20965 , and 47736 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/235370/virtues-of-makkah-and-madinah
193008,"I embraced Islam when I was seventeen, and for a long time I had no sources to learn from except the Internet. So I used to pray in an incorrect manner, and I carried on like that for more than a year. In the beginning, I used to pray in the Shi‘i way, then I was guided to the path of Ahl al-Sunnah. I also used to do wudu’ in an imperfect manner, and I did not know Arabic, so I used to recite al-Fatihah and other adhkar incorrectly. In other words, for more than a year, my prayer contained many errors. My question is: do I have to make up those prayers?","['Praise be to Allah.If someone is new in Islam and is not able to do what Allah has enjoined upon him of purification, prayer or fasting in the prescribed manner that absolves him of accountability because he is unaware of the rulings, and does not have sufficient, sound means of acquiring sound knowledge, so he thinks that what he is doing is what is prescribed, then when it becomes clear to him that he is wrong, he follows the truth and adheres to Allah’s rulings and what He has prescribed, then he should not be instructed to repeat what he did imperfectly of the duties enjoined by Allah. He is excused for his ignorance, because he only did things the way he did them before because he was ignorant and made mistakes, and he is to be excused for that, because of the general meaning of the verses (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And never would We punish until We sent a messenger}\xa0[al-Isra’ 17:15]\n{And never would your Lord have destroyed the cities until He had sent to their mother a messenger reciting to them Our verses}\xa0[al-Qasas 28:59]\n{Our Lord, do not impose blame upon us if we have forgotten or erred}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:286].\nIbn Majah (2034) narrated that Abu Dharr al-Ghifari (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has forgiven my ummah for what they do by mistake or out of forgetfulness, and what they are forced to do.” Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah.\nAl-Hafiz said in al-Fath (5/161):\nThis is a great hadith. Some of these scholars said: It should be counted as half of Islam, because deeds are either done intentionally and by choice, or they are not. The latter either happens by mistake, or out of forgetfulness, or because one is forced to do it, and this category is forgiven, according to scholarly consensus. Rather the scholars only differed as to whether what is overlooked is the sin or the ruling or both? The apparent meaning of the hadith points to the last of these, and whatever is exempted from that, such as murder, has its own evidence. End quote.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf someone prays without deliberation, and does not know that that is obligatory, there is a difference of scholarly opinion regarding him: does he have to repeat it after the time for the prayer has ended or not? There are two well-known views, both of which are views in the madhhab of Ahmad and others.\nThe correct view is that in such a case, the person is not required to repeat the prayer, because it is soundly narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that he said to the Bedouin who prayed badly: “Go and pray, for you have not prayed,” two or three times, then the man said: By the One Who sent you with the truth, I cannot do any better than this, so teach me what will suffice me in my prayer. So the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) taught him to pray with deliberation. (Agreed upon). And he did not instruct him to repeat whatever he had prayed before that time, even though he said, By the One Who sent you with the truth, I cannot do any better than this. Rather he instructed him to repeat that prayer, because the time for it had not yet ended, so he was instructed to offer that prayer on time. But in the case of prayers for which the time had ended, he did not instruct him to repeat them, even though he had omitted some of their obligatory parts, because he had not been aware that that was required of him. Similarly, he did not instruct ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) to make up the prayers that he did not offer because of being in a state of janabah, because he was not aware that he could have prayed after doing tayammum. And in the case of the woman who was suffering from istihadah [prolonged non-menstrual bleeding], she said to him: I suffer from extremely heavy bleeding that prevents me from fasting and praying, he instructed her to do wudu’ for each prayer, but he did not instruct her to make up the prayers that she had not offered. By the same token, in the case of those who ate during Ramadan until one of them could distinguish a white thread from a black thread, so they ate after dawn had broken, he did not instruct them to repeat their fasts. These people were unaware of what was obligatory, but he did not instruct them to make up what they had failed to do when they were ignorant of the rulings. Moreover, a disbeliever is not instructed to make up what he did not do when he was in a state of disbelief and ignorance, in contrast to one who was aware of what is obligatory, but failed to do what is required because he forgot; such a person is to be instructed to do it when he remembers it.""(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa\xa0 21/429-431).\nAl-Suyuti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf someone is unaware of the prohibition of something of which most people are aware, the claim of ignorance cannot be accepted from him, unless he is a recent convert to Islam, or he grew up in a remote wilderness where people may not be aware of these prohibitions, such as the prohibition on zina, murder, stealing and alcohol, and on speaking during the prayer or eating when fasting.""(Al-Ashbah wa’n-Naza’ir\xa0p. 200).\nBased on that, you do not have to repeat those prayers that you offered before.

225160,What are the guidelines on how to give advice in Islam? Should it be done privately or in front of other people? Who is qualified to do that?,"['Praise be to Allah.Virtues of giving advice in Islam\nGiving sincere advice is one of the prominent characteristics of Islamic brotherhood; it is part of perfect faith and Ihsan, for a Muslim’s faith cannot be perfect until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself, and until he hates for his brother what he hates for himself. This forms the motive for giving sincere advice.\nAl-Bukhari (57) and Muslim (56) narrated that Jarir ibn `Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I gave my oath of allegiance to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), pledging to establish regular prayer, pay Zakah and be sincere towards every Muslim.\nMuslim (55) narrated from Tamim Ad-Dari (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Religion is sincerity.” We said: To whom? He said: “To Allah, to His Book, to His Messenger, and to the leaders of the Muslims and their common folk.”\nIbn Al-Athir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Sincerity towards the common folk of the Muslims means: guiding them to that which is in their best interests.” (An-Nihayah, 5/142)\nEtiquette of giving advice in Islam\nThere is a general etiquette for giving sincere advice to which the one who is compassionate towards the Muslims should adhere. This includes the following:\n\nHis motive for giving advice should be love of good for his brother and hating for anything bad to befall him.\xa0\n\nIbn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“With regard to giving sincere advice to the Muslims, [the one who wishes to do that] should love for them what he loves for himself, hate for them what he hates for himself, feel compassion for them, show mercy to their young ones, show respect to their elders, and share their grief and their joy, even if that is detrimental to his worldly interests, such as loving for prices to be dropped for them, even if that causes him to lose some profits on what he sells of trade goods. By the same token, he should hate everything that could cause them harm. He should love what is good for them, and hope for harmony to exist among them and for them to continue enjoying the blessings of Allah. He should pray that they always prevail against their enemies and that all harm be warded off from them. Abu `Amr ibn As-Salah said: Nasihah (sincerity, sincere advice) is a comprehensive word which means that the one who is sincere should want all kinds of good for the one to whom advice is offered, and should try to achieve that for him. (Jami` Al-`Uloom wa’l-Hikam, p. 80)\n\nHe should be sincere when giving advice , seeking thereby to please Allah. He should not intend thereby to prove his superiority over his brother.\n\n\nThat advice should be free of any element of deceit or betrayal.\xa0\n\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Sincerity means being truthful and honest, with no element of deceit or betrayal. The Muslim, because of his great loyalty and love towards his brother, is sincere towards him and advises him to do all that will benefit him and that he thinks is pure, with no element of insincerity or deceit. Hence the Arabs say Dhahab Nasih [from the same root as Nasihah], meaning pure gold that is free of any element of cheating. And they say `Asal Nasih (pure honey), meaning honey that is free of beeswax or any element of cheating.” (Majmu` Fatawa Ibn Baz, 5/90)\n\nHe should not intend when giving advice to shame his brother or put him down.\n\nIbn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) wrote an essay on this topic entitled Al-Farq Bayna An-Nasihah wat-Ta`yir (The difference between sincere advice and shaming).\n\nThe advice should be given in a spirit of brotherhood and friendship, with no element of rebuke or harshness. Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n“Invite to the way of your Lord with wisdom and good instruction, and argue with them in a way that is best.”\xa0[An-Nahl 16:125]\n\nIt should be done on the basis of knowledge and clear proof.\xa0\n\nAs-Sa`di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“Wisdom dictates that giving advice to others should be done on the basis of knowledge, not ignorance, and that one should start with that which is more important, then that which is less important, and with that which is easy to explain and understand, and that which is more likely to be accepted. The advice should be given in a kind and gentle manner. If the person to whom the advice is given pays heed to this approach, which is based on wisdom, all well and good; otherwise we should move on to exhorting him with good instruction, which means enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong, accompanied by mention of the reward from Allah for doing good and the punishment for doing wrong. If the person to whom that is addressed believes that what he is doing is sound and correct, or he calls people to falsehood, then we should argue (debate) with him in a way that is best, which means debating with him in ways that are based on rational arguments and religious texts, which includes quoting evidence that he regards as sound and valid, for that is more likely to lead to a positive response. The debate should not lead to dispute or trading of insults, for that would defeat the purpose and serve no interest; rather the aim of the debate is to guide people to the truth, not merely to prove the other side wrong, and so on. (Tafsir As-Sa`di (p. 452)\n\nThe advice should be given privately, not out loud in front of people, unless doing so serves a clear interest that outweighs any negative consequences.\xa0\n\nIbn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“When the early generations wanted to advise someone, they would exhort him in private, to the extent that one of them said: Whoever exhorts his brother one-to-one, that is sincere advice (Nasihah), whoever exhorts him in front of people is shaming him. Al-Fudayl said: The believer conceals his brother’s faults and gives him advice in private, whereas the evildoer exposes his faults and shames him.” (Jami` Al-`Ulum wal Hikam, 1/236)\nIbn Hazm (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“If you give advice, then give advice in private, not in public, and by hinting, not by speaking bluntly, unless the person to whom advice is given will not understand hints, in which case there is no option but to speak bluntly.… If you go beyond these guidelines, then you are wronging him and are not being sincere in your advice.” (Al-Akhlaq was Siyar, p. 45)\nHowever, if there is a scenario where giving advice openly clearly serves the greater interest, then there is nothing wrong with giving advice openly, such as correcting one who made a mistake in matters of belief (`Aqidah) in front of people, lest people be deceived by what he said and follow him in his mistake. Another example is denouncing someone who tells people that Riba (usury) is permissible, or spreads Bid`ah (innovation) and immorality among people. In such cases giving advice in public is prescribed, and may even be obligatory, because of the greater interest that is served thereby, and so as to ward off harm that is likely to occur.\nIbn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“If the aim is no more than highlighting the truth of the matter, so that people will not be deceived by the wrong notions uttered by that person, then undoubtedly he (the one who seeks to give advice) will be rewarded for his intention, and on the basis of his intention he will be regarded as being sincere towards Allah, His Messenger, the leaders of the Muslims and their common folk.” (Al-Farq Bayna An-Nasihah wat Ta`yir, p. 7)\n\nThe one who seeks to give sincere advice should choose the best words and phrases, deal gently with the person who he is advising, and speak kindly to him.\nThe one who seeks to give advice should bear with patience any harm that may result because of his advice.\nHe should respect confidentiality and conceal the faults of his fellow Muslim, and not speak ill of him to others. The giver of sincere advice is gentle and compassionate, loves good and seeks to conceal people’s faults.\nHe should verify the facts before offering advice, and not act on the basis of assumption or conjecture, so that he will not be accusing his brother of something that he did not do.\nHe should choose the appropriate time to give advice. Ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: People’s energy fluctuates; sometimes they are focused and receptive, and sometimes they lack energy and are not receptive. So approach people when they are energetic and receptive, and let them be when they are lacking energy and focus. (Narrated by Ibn Al-Mubarak in Az-Zuhd, 1331)\nHe should practice what he preaches, doing what he enjoins people to do and refraining from that which he forbids them to do. Allah, may He be Exalted, said, rebuking the Children of Israel for the contradiction between their words and deeds (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n“Do you order righteousness of the people and forget yourselves while you recite the Scripture? Then will you not reason?”\xa0[Al-Baqarah 2:44]\nThere is a stern warning to the one who tells people to do what is right when he does not do it himself, and forbids them to do what is wrong when he does it himself.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/225160/etiquette-of-giving-advice-in-islam
