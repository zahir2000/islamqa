479866,"I work for a company that has contracts with some organisations, and it only accepts payment by electronic means, by passing the cell phone over a magnetic card. When the customer pays the bill, 2% or more of the total amount is added, and this is regarded as a tip for the workers. The customer may pay more as a tip, or he has the option of cancelling the tip and paying the value of the invoice only. But often the customers do not notice that they are paying an additional amount on the invoice. Is doing this haram or halal? What is the ruling on me doing that to them?","[""Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nGiving tips to workers is permissible, subject to two conditions:\n1. That it is done with the consent of the customer.\n2. That it is done with the consent of the company for whom the workers are working. If it is not done with the knowledge and consent of the company, then it comes under the heading of gifts to workers, which is haram.\nPlease see the answer to question no. 143737 .\nSecondly:\nIt is not permissible to collect tips in a way that is not noticed by the customer, because this is consuming their wealth unlawfully. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{O you who have believed, do not consume one another's wealth unjustly but only [in lawful] business by mutual consent}\xa0[an-Nisa’ 4:29].\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “It is not permissible to take someone’s wealth except with his willing consent.” Narrated by Ahmad (20172); classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Ahmad (7662).\nTips are to be regarded as a gift that is given willingly, and they are not valid unless they are given with the consent of the giver who is an adult of sound mind.\nIt says in Nayl al-Ma’arib bi Sharh Dalil at-Talib (2/28) in the chapter on gifts:\nThere are eight conditions [for giving of gifts]:\n1. The gift should be given by someone who is permitted to dispose of his wealth, meaning that he should be free [not a slave], accountable and of sound mind.\n2. It should be given voluntarily, of his own free will. A gift is not valid if it is given by one who is forced and is not joking. In that case, it is not valid…\nIn Majallat al-Ahkam al-‘Adliyyah (no.860) it says: It is stipulated, with regard to gifts, that the giver should be giving it willingly; a gift is not valid if the giver is forced to give it.\nIt says in Durar al-Hukkam Sharh Majallat al-Ahkam (2/399):\nIn order for a gift or charity to be valid, it is stipulated that the giver should give willingly. There are two scenarios in which the giver is not giving willingly:\nThe first scenario is when he is forced and compelled. Based on that, the gift is not valid if the giver is forced to give it and gives it unwillingly…\nThe second scenario is when the giver is prompted to say words indicative of giving in a language that he does not know. If the recipient prompts the giver to say “Wahabtu minka ma li ‘alayka min al-alf [What you owe me of one thousand is a gift for you],” and he says it, but the giver does not understand Arabic and there is no one to explain to him what this sentence means, this gift and waiving of the debt is not valid, if it is done in this way. That is because, even if there is no compulsion in this scenario, there is no consent to this giving. End quote.\nIf the customer does not notice the tip, it is haram for the worker to accept it and it is haram for the credit card company to make this addition subtle and not alert the customer to it, because that is helping in consuming wealth unlawfully, which is haram. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And cooperate in righteousness and piety, but do not cooperate in sin and transgression. And fear Allah; indeed, Allah is severe in penalty}\xa0[al-Ma’idah 5:2].\nIf the company makes the paying of tips unclear so that the customer does not notice it, then they must be advised to make the matter very clear to the customer. If they insist on hiding it, then you should not carry on working for them. Whoever gives up something for the sake of Allah, Allah will compensate him with something better than it.\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/479866/he-adds-the-tip-to-the-customers-bill-when-he-pays-electronically-without-the-customers-knowledge-and-without-him-realising-that
205100,I am an employee in a government-run company. My question is whether the health insurance offered by my company is permissible. It can be summed up in the following two points:,"['Praise be to Allah.Difference between cooperative insurance and commercial insurance\xa0\nThe most important difference between cooperative insurance and commercial insurance is that the money deducted for cooperative insurance is not owned by the committee that is administering the fund; rather it remains a donation that is to be spent on whoever meets the conditions.\nIn contrast, the administrators of commercial health insurance funds have ownership of the subscriptions and deductibles paid by the subscribers, and that is included in their personal accounts, in return for the administration committee being committed to treat anyone who meets the conditions. There is a big difference between the two types.\xa0\n\nThe first type is cooperative and offers mutual support, and there is a Hadith that supports it in principle. It was narrated that Abu Musa (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If the Ash`aris run short of provisions during a campaign, or they run short of food for their families in Madinah, they gather whatever they have in a single cloth and share it out equally amongst themselves. They belong to me and I belong to them.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 2486)\xa0\n\nAl-Bukhari included it in a chapter entitled: “Chapter on sharing food and other resources, and how to divide that which may be weighed or measured handful by handful (without weighing it or measuring it), because the Muslims did not see anything wrong with sharing out provisions when traveling so that one could come and have some, and another could come and have some…”\xa0\n\nAs for the second type (commercial insurance ), it is a kind of gambling; all contemporary Fiqh councils are agreed that it is forbidden.\xa0\n\nDifferences between lawful and forbidden cooperative health insurance\xa0\nThere are other essential differences between cooperative health insurance to which it is permissible to subscribe, and that forbidden type of insurance which is based on gambling. It is essential to investigate these differences before issuing a fatwa ruling that any specific case is lawful or prohibited.\xa0\nIt says in Al-Ma`ayir Ash-Shar‘iyyah (p. 372-373):\xa0\nThe reason why cooperative insurance is permissible and commercial insurance is forbidden is the following essential differences:\xa0\n\nTraditional (commercial) insurance is a contract offering something in return for financial compensation; it is aimed at making a profit from the insurance itself, therefore it is subject to the same rulings as other financial transactions, whereby it may be affected by ambiguity. The ruling on traditional insurance is that it is forbidden according to Shari`ah. As for cooperative insurance, it is a commitment to donate and is not affected by ambiguity.\nThe company that manages Islamic insurance [or an insurance fund in some cases, such as that mentioned in this question] is acting as an agent when drawing up the insurance contract. In contrast, the company is a main party in the case of commercial insurance and draws up contracts in its own name.\nIn the case of commercial insurance , the company has ownership of the payments made in return for the commitment to pay out money in the case of illness. In the case of the Islamic insurance company, it does not have ownership of these payments, because these payments become the property of the fund .\nWhatever is left of the payments and their returns – after payment of expenses and compensation – remains in the ownership of the policy holders, and this is the surplus which is to be distributed to them. But this is not possible in the case of commercial insurance, because the payments become the property of the company by virtue of the contract and receipt of the payments. In fact that money is regarded as income and profit in the case of commercial insurance.\nReturns on the investment of monthly subscriptions, after deducting a percentage of the profit for the company (which is investing the fund), go back to the policyholders in the case of Islamic insurance, and they go back to the company itself in the case of commercial insurance.\nIslamic insurance is aimed at creating cooperation between different members of society; it is not aimed at making a profit by selling the insurance. In contrast, commercial insurance is aimed at making a profit from the insurance itself.\nIn the case of Islamic insurance, the company’s profits result from investing its money and its share of the profit in Mudarabah investments, because it is managing the funds and investments, and the fund itself is the owner of the wealth.\nThe one who subscribes and the one who is giving the insurance is the same in the case of Islamic insurance, even though they may be different in practical terms. In the case of commercial insurance, they are two completely different entities.\nIn the case of Islamic insurance, the company is bound by the rulings of Shari`ah and the Fatwas of its Shari`ah committee. In the case of commercial insurance, it is not bound by the rulings of Shari`ah. End quote.\n\nWe know that many of these differences are not relevant when speaking about the fund mentioned in the question, but we have quoted them here so that the reader may understand the real and important differences between cooperative insurance which is permissible, and commercial insurance which is forbidden, and thus will be able to weigh up and judge other types of governmental health insurance funds.\xa0\nHow to issue a Fatwa regarding funds of insurance\xa0\nIn order to issue a precise Fatwa concerning your fund and to try to help you to follow the Shar`i guidelines on cooperative insurance, it is essential that you send us the official documents which regulate the work of the fund, and the contracts that subscribers have to sign, so that we can study them and determine the ruling on them. Although we think it most likely that the way your fund is operated is sound, in sha Allah, we cannot be certain of the ruling before examining the official rules and regulations governing the fund, and the application forms for joining it.\xa0\nThe book Al-Ma`ayir Ash-Shar`iyyah stipulates a number of basic matters which must be stated in the articles of association of cooperative funds, as it says (p. 364):\xa0\n“Islamic insurance is an agreement among people who are exposed to a particular danger to deal with any harm resulting from this danger, by paying subscriptions in the form of a commitment to donate; from that a fund is formed that is a separate, financially independent, virtual entity, from which compensation is paid for harm that may befall one of the subscribers because of some danger against which he was insured, in accordance with the bylaws and contracts. The administration of this fund is handled by a committee chosen from among the policyholders or by a limited liability company in return for a fee paid to administer the insurance and invest the money in the fund.\xa0\nAs for traditional insurance, it is a financial transaction that is aimed at making profits from the insurance itself, subject to the rulings on financial transactions that may be affected by ambiguity; the ruling on traditional insurance is that it is forbidden according to Shari`ah (because of the ambiguity it involves).\xa0\nPrinciples of Islamic insurance\xa0\nIslamic insurance is based upon the following Shar`i guidelines and principles, which must be stated clearly in the company’s articles of association:\xa0\n\nThe commitment to donate, whereby the policyholder donates his monthly subscriptions and the returns on them to the fund, in order to pay compensation. He may also commit himself to pay his share towards covering any deficit, in accordance with the bylaws.\nThe company that is running the insurance fund should have two separate accounts: one which has to do with the company itself and its rights and commitments, and another which has to do with the fund and the rights and commitments of the policyholders.\nThe company is acting as an agent when administering the fund and when investing what is owned by the fund.\nThe insurance account has to do with whatever is owned by the fund and the returns on its investments, as well as other commitments.\nThe bylaws may include a clause dealing with disposal of any surplus according to what serves the interests of the policyholders, provided that the company that is administering the fund does not get any of this surplus.\nIn the event of liquidation, all the money in the fund and any surplus accumulated is to be spent on charitable causes.\nIt is preferred that the policyholders should administer the insurance fund.\nThe company is committed to abide by all rulings and principles of Islamic Shari`ah in all its activities and investments, and in particular is not to insure anything that is forbidden.\nA Shari`ah watchdog committee should be appointed whose fatwas will be binding upon the company.”\xa0\n\nAll of these matters should be paid attention to in the bylaws that regulate the activities of the insurance fund, especially those that invest these subscriptions of the people insured for the benefit of the fund. It is essential to ensure that these principles are present in the bylaws and articles of association governing the insurance.\xa0\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/205100/difference-between-cooperative-insurance-and-commercial-insurance

265477,"My husband died a short while ago, and I have two daughters. My parents had to come and live with me, but that means that my father has to travel a long way to his work. I have money that belongs to me and my two daughters; is it permissible for me to use some of this money to buy a three-wheeled motorcycle for my father (because he goes around and sells goods) on the basis that he is our provider, for me and my daughters? Please note that in a few months’ time I will start to receive my husband’s pension, in sha Allah.","[""Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt is permissible to use some of your money to buy a motorbike for your father, because it is valid for an adult of sound mind to give up some of his or her money for nothing in return.\nSecondly:\nIt is not permissible to give any of the orphan’s wealth as a loan or gift, or any other kind of giving that brings no benefit to the orphan, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And do not approach the orphan's property except in a way that is best}\xa0[al-An‘am 6:152]\n{They ask you concerning [the property of] orphans. Say: The best thing to do is to manage it in their best interests}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:220].\nIt says in al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (43/198): The Hanafis, Malikis, Shafa‘is and Hanbalis are of the view that the guardian who is in charge of an orphan and his wealth has no right to give away the wealth of a minor, whether that is by way of charity or a gift for nothing in return, because giving away some of the minor’s wealth brings him no benefit, and it is contrary to the purpose of being in charge of and taking care of an orphan, which is to protect his wealth and manage it in a manner that will bring benefit to the minor, based on the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And do not approach the orphan's property except in a way that is best}\xa0[al-An‘am 6:152].\nThus it is forbidden to approach the orphan’s wealth or property except in a manner that will serve the orphan’s interests.

The first step in following Islam is to learn about it from its authentic sources, and to persevere in doing so.\nIt was narrated from Humayd ibn `Abd Ar-Rahman: I heard Mu`awiyah saying in a speech: I heard the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “If Allah intends good for a person, He causes him to understand Islam.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 71 and Muslim, 1037)\nIt was narrated from `Uthman (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The best of you are those who learn the Quran and teach it.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 5027)\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Included in the meaning of the words “The best of you are those who learn the Quran and teach it” is teaching both the letters and their meanings; in fact learning its meanings is the first intended purpose of teaching its letters (and how to recite it). That is what increases faith .” (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 13/403)\nThe way of the early generations was to persevere in learning what the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) brought, then after that they persevered in acting upon what they had learned.\nIt was narrated that Ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: If one of us learned ten verses, he would not go beyond them until he learned their meanings and put them into practice. (Narrated by At-Tabari in his Tafsir, 1/74)\nIt was narrated from Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: We lived for a short time of our lives when the youngest among us would learn about faith before learning the Quran. A Surah would be revealed to Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), so he [the youngest among us] would learn what that Surah said was lawful and prohibited, and what limits it said were to be adhered to, the way you learn the Quran. Then he said: I saw men, one of whom would learn the Quran and recite everything in it, from beginning to end, not knowing what therein was a command and what was a prohibition, or what limits were to be adhered to, reciting it rapidly like broadcasting seeds. (Narrated by Al-Hakim in Al-Mustadrak (1/35) He said: “This is a Hadith which is authentic according to the conditions of the two shaykhs [Al-Bukhari and Muslim], and I do not know of anything wrong with it; Adh-Dhahabi agreed with him)\nIt was narrated that Abu `Abd Ar-Rahman As-Sulami (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Those of the companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) who taught us the Quran told us that they used to learn ten verses from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and they would not learn the next ten until they had learned what those ten verses contained of knowledge and dictated of actions. They said: So we learned knowledge along with how to act upon it. (Narrated by Ahmad in Al-Musnad (38/466); classed as sound by the commentators on Al-Musnad.)\n\nThe second thing is the way in which they followed the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), for they followed him with sincerity that was not contaminated with any corrupt intention, and with certain faith that was not mixed with any doubt.\n\nWhen they learned what the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) brought, they learned it with a sincere intention, and they learned it with certain and steadfast faith . When they acted upon what they had learned, they were entirely sincere in that, and they strove against their evil inclinations, against the impulse to show off, against aiming for worldly gain by means of their knowledge and worship, all of that in accordance with the words of Allah, may He be Exalted (interpretation of the meaning):\n“O you who have believed, fear Allah and be with those who are true.” [At-Tawbah 9:119]\nShaykh `Abd Ar-Rahman As-Sa `di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“and be with those who are true” that is, those who are true in word, deed and conduct, those whose words are true and whose deeds and conduct cannot be but based on truth, devoid of laziness and apathy, free of bad intentions, and based on sincerity and good intentions. For truthfulness leads to righteousness, and righteousness leads to Paradise.\nAllah, may He be Exalted, says elsewhere (interpretation of the meaning): “This is the Day when the truthful will benefit from their truthfulness.” [Al-Ma’idah 5:119] (Tafsir As-Sa`di, p. 355)\nIbn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Virtue cannot be attained by doing a lot of physical deeds; rather it is attained by making those deeds sincerely for Allah, may He be Glorified\xa0 and Exalted; by making them sound and correct in accordance with the Sunnah; and by making one’s emotions and feelings in the heart sincere and connected to Allah.\nThe one who has more knowledge of Allah and of His religion and its rulings and teachings, and has more fear of Him, love of Him and hope in Him, is better than one who is not like that, even if the latter does a lot of righteous deeds and physical actions.\nHence some of the early generations said: Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) did not surpass them by fasting and praying a great deal, rather it was by means of something that he had in his heart… Mention was made to Abu Sulayman of how long the Children of Israel lived and how hard they strove in doing righteous deeds, and that some of the people envied them for that.\nHe said: All that Allah wants of you is sincerity of intention , and sincerely seeking that which is with Him – or words to that effect.\nIbn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said to his companions: You fast and pray more than the companions of Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), yet they were better than you.\nThey said: Why is that?\nHe (may Allah be pleased with him) said: They had less interest than you in worldly gain, and greater desire for the hereafter.” (Majmu` Rasa’il Ibn Rajab, 4/412-413)\nIn conclusion, the way to attain a high level of faith as our righteous forebears (may Allah be pleased with them) did is, firstly, by persevering in seeking to understand what the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) brought, then by persevering in doing what he enjoined and in refraining from what he forbade. All of that is to be done with true sincerity, having no interest in worldly gain, and hoping for the hereafter. The core of the matter is beseeching Allah, may He be Exalted, seeking guidance and steadfastness from Him, for the entire matter is in the hand of Allah, may He be Exalted. You should seek out times when supplications are more likely to be answered, such as the last third of the night, for the Salaf used to seek out these times.\nIt was narrated from Ibn Shihab Az-Zuhri, from Al-Agharr and Abu Salamah ibn `Abd Ar-Rahman, that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Our Lord, blessed be His Name, comes down to the lowest heaven every night when the last third of the night remains, and says: `Who will call upon Me, that I may answer him? Who will ask of Me, that I may give him? Who will ask Me for forgiveness, that I may forgive him?’ And that continues until the break of dawn.” Hence they preferred to pray at the end of the night, rather than at the beginning.\nNarrated by Imam Ahmad in Al-Musnad (13/35); classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Irwa’ Al-Ghalil (2/196)\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/287792/how-the-salaf-attained-strong-faith
