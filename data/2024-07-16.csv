175964,"I suffer from perfectionism, and I realized recently that perfectionists are the ones who procrastinate the most, because of this condition. I have also experienced that myself. I want to rid myself of procrastination because it comes from the Shaytan. Praise be to Allah, I do not procrastinate in matters having to do with religion, but I do that in other matters. I would like you to give me some advice that will enable me to rid myself of perfectionism and thus be able to resist procrastinating. I hope that you can help.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe Muslim’s striving for perfection in his attitude, worship and interactions with people is a good thing, and his efforts to attain that are efforts aimed at attaining sublime goals. But this perfectionism may conflict with the real-life situation in which the Muslim lives, and that may lead to frustration. Moreover, he may find himself weak in some aspects, so he gives up on goodness altogether. Therefore there is nothing better than moderation in all things and striving to do one’s best. This is the advice that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) gave to his ummah when he said: “Do your best, but do not go to extremes; pray during the forenoon and the afternoon, and during a part of the night; always adopt a moderate course and you will reach your goal.” \xa0Narrated by al-Bukhari (6098). See a commentary on this hadith in the answer the question no. 70314 .\nHence one of the most important things that the Muslim should do in order to ward off perfectionism is being realistic. So he should not go to extremes in attempting to do that which he may not be able to do, or he may not be able to continue doing, which would cause him to become frustrated, and that in turn would lead to him giving up striving for what is best.\nAmong the things that are said by specialists who treat your condition of perfectionism are the following:\n1. You should set realistic goals that are possible to achieve and give up perfectionism which may prevent you from reaching these goals.\n2. You should not compare yourself to others, and you should convince yourself that each person has his own talents and abilities that suit him. This point may be very important, because there are errors that many people make in raising their children when they are small, as they raise them to be perfectionists with regard to their study grades, so the children try to please their parents for fear of failure. Thus perfectionism becomes deeply rooted, which causes anxiety when a person experiences reality and sees it with his own eyes.\n3. You should not fear criticism from other people when you are striving to change, improve yourself and live your real life.\n4. Finally, there is nothing wrong with going to see a trustworthy specialist psychologist. Perhaps if he listens to you and you talk to him, he may be able to treat your condition, by Allah’s leave.\nSecondly:\nWith regard to dealing with procrastination – which refers to delaying things and putting them off – it may be dealt with in several ways, including the following:\n1. Deciding to be firm and have strong resolve, and deciding to work hard today so that you may rest tomorrow, is better than resting today and having to strive hard tomorrow.\n2. Reminding yourself constantly that procrastination stems from helplessness and weakness, and helplessness and weakness are not characteristics of the Muslim. Rather if a person is proud of being human, he would not like to have these characteristics.\n3. Constantly calling upon Allah in supplication and beseeching Him to free you from helplessness and laziness.\n4. Keeping away from lazy people and procrastinators, and keeping company with people of resolve, determination and strength, for that will lead you to strive against your nafs and become a person of resolve, determination and strength.\n5. Learning from the early generations and the way in which they viewed procrastination and had a strong aversion towards it, which led them to keep away from it in word and deed, and in their thoughts and behaviour.\nThe caliph ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Part of strength is not to put off today’s work until tomorrow.""(Afat ‘ala at-Tariq by Shaykh Sayyid Nuh).\nWe ask Allah, may He be exalted, to help and guide you to do that which pleases Him, and to make you among those who are serious and obedient to Him.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/175964/she-suffers-from-perfectionism-which-leads-to-procrastination
509261,"My friend developed an app called Raudhatul Mahabbah.The app as he claims “aims to increase the love of the Prophet in peoples hearts.” The app itself comprises of the following:on Thursday a person sets his target of how many times he wants to do salawat on the Prophet on Friday.Then on Friday the person writes his achievement.Since this app is used by many people,a computer adds totals of all people and then gives the people their totals by percentage.My Question is,is this similar tp the hadith of Ibn Masud and the circle of dhikr,is it an innovation,or is it something praiseworthy?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nSending blessings upon the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is one of the noblest acts of worship that may bring one closer to Allah. It is more emphasized at certain times, including Friday and the night before Friday, because of the report narrated by Ahmad (16162), Abu Dawud (1531), an-Nasa’i (1734) and Ibn Majah (1085) from Aws ibn Aws, who said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “One of the best of your days is Friday. So send a great deal of blessings upon me on that day, for your blessings will be shown to me.” They said, O Messenger of Allah, how will our blessings be shown to you when you will have disintegrated? He said, “Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, has forbidden the earth to consume the bodies of the Prophets.” Classed as sahih by al-Albani and Shu‘ayb al-Arna’ut.\nAl-Bayhaqi narrated in as-Sunan in a report from Anas which was attributed to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “Send a great deal of blessings upon me on Friday and the night before Friday, for whoever sends blessings upon me, Allah will send blessings upon him tenfold.” Classed as hasan by al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami‘, no. 545, and in as-Sahihah (1407).\nSecondly:\nThere is nothing wrong with making an app to remind you to send blessings upon the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on Friday, and there is nothing wrong with setting a target and hoping to meet this target number of sending blessings, on condition that you do not believe that there is any particular virtue in this number; rather the intention is to encourage yourself. So you may resolve to send blessings upon him one thousand times, for example, or two thousand times, or more or less than that.\nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 88102 .\nThirdly:\nThere is nothing wrong with the app showing the number of people who are sending blessings upon the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and the total number of times they have done that, and giving the people their totals by percentage – meaning that it shows a comparison between participants, without displaying their names – and the like, because there are no shar‘i reservations regarding that, as it encourages people and makes them want to do better in sending blessings upon the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nOne of the things to watch out for in this matter is that if people know that a particular person recited such and such a number of blessings on the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), that may lead to self-admiration or showing off, which could render his good deed invalid.\nAs for the example mentioned, we do not see anything wrong with it. However, the one who uses this app should only use it sometimes, and not at other times or many times, so that his motivation will not be to see the number of blessings he recited shown on the screen or to meet the target that he set on the app. That is because this could impact his good deeds, or create a condition in his mind, such that his dhikr and blessings upon the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) will be connected to the app and the target it has set, even if he does not realize that and is not aware of it. This is a serious negative result of using these apps and the like.\nOnce he has trained himself to send blessings upon the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and he has made that a regular part of his dhikr which he does not usually forget, then he should do that by himself for himself, and stop using the app.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/509261/what-is-the-ruling-on-subscribing-to-an-app-which-lets-you-set-a-target-number-of-times-to-send-blessings-upon-the-prophet-blessings-and-peace-of-allah-be-upon-him-on-friday
104215,When should we dust off the bed three times? Is it before sleeping or after? How should it be done?,"['Praise be to Allah.Al-Bukhari (6320) and Muslim (2714) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When one of you goes to his bed, let him dust off his bed with the inside of his lower garment, for he does not know what came onto it after he left it. Then let him say: Bismika Rabbi wada`tu janbi wa bika arfa`uhu wa in amsakta nafsi farhamha wa in arsaltaha fahfadh-ha bima tahfadhu bihi `ibadika As-salihin ( In Your name, my Lord, I lie down, and in Your name I rise. If You should take my soul then have mercy on it, and if You should return my soul then protect it as You protect Your righteous slaves).”\xa0\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Sharh Muslim:\n“The inside of his lower garment” means its edge. What is meant is that it is recommended to dust down his bed before lying on it, lest there be a snake or scorpion or other harmful thing in it. And he should dust it down with his hand covered by the edge of his lower garment, lest something bad happen to his hand if there is anything there.”\xa0\nHence it is known that dusting down the bed is to be done when one wants to sleep, and it may be done with the edge of one’s garment or something else.\xa0\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 21216 , 30784 , 145543 , 72591 , 21647 ,\xa0 and 50010 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/104215/is-dusting-the-bed-before-sleeping-sunnah
