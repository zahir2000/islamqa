342926,"I did Hajj with my family a few years ago, and on the third of the days of at-tashriq [i.e., 13th Dhul-Hijjah], we set out after ‘Asr to stone the jamarat. The route was crowded, and before stoning the jamarat or whilst stoning them – I don’t remember exactly – we heard the adhan for Maghrib. I believe that we finished stoning the jamarat whilst the adhan was still ongoing, but I am not sure. My father was behind us, and it seems that he stoned the jamarat after Maghrib. What should we do?","['Praise be to Allah.When does the time for stoning the jamarat end on the third of the days of at-tashriq?\nThe time for stoning the jamarat on the third of the days of at-tashriq ends at sunset, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And remember Allah during [specific] numbered days. Then whoever hastens [his departure] in two days - there is no sin upon him; and whoever delays [until the third] - there is no sin upon him - for him who fears Allah . And fear Allah and know that unto Him you will be gathered}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:203].\nSo whoever stones the jamarat after sunset, his stoning does not count. The basic principle is that the mu’adhdhin does not give the call to prayer except when the sun has set. Based on that, whatever stoning occurs after the adhan is not valid.\nRuling on one who omits to stone the jamarat\nIf someone omits to stone all of the jamarat, or he omits stoning them on one day, or he omits stoning one jamrah, then he must offer a compensatory sacrifice, which is a sheep, to be slaughtered and the meat given to the poor of Makkah and the Haram.\nIt says in Kashshaf al-Qina‘ (2/510):\nIf he delays stoning the jamarat altogether until after the days of at-tashriq, or he delays stoning Jamrat al-‘Aqabah until after the days of at-tashriq, or he omits to spend the night in Mina for one night or more of the nights of the days of at-tashriq, then he must offer a compensatory sacrifice, because Ibn ‘Abbas said: Whoever omits or forgets a ritual, he must slaughter an animal [as a compensatory sacrifice].\nFrom this it is known that if he omitted to spend part of a night in Mina, nothing is required of him. What appears to be the case is that that applies even if he spent most of the night somewhere other than Mina.\nHe should not do it – i.e., stoning the jamarat – after the days of at-tashriq have ended, which also applies to staying overnight in Mina during those nights. If he omitted to do it, he should not do it now, because the time for it has gone, but he must offer the fidyah that is required for that.\nIf he omits one pebble, the penalty is the same as that for shaving one hair, and if he omits two pebbles, the penalty is that of shaving two hairs. For more than that, he must offer a compensatory sacrifice, as mentioned above with regard to shaving the head [before exiting ihram]. End quote.\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Omitting stoning the jamarat altogether only requires one fidyah. So if he omitted stoning altogether, or he omitted part of it, if he omitted stoning one of the three jamarat, or he omitted stoning on one complete day, he only has to offer one fidyah, which will cover all of it.\nBut the scholars stated that if what is omitted is one or two pebbles for the last jamrah, then it may be overlooked, according to many scholars, but if he omitted three pebbles, it cannot be overlooked; rather he must complete it. If the time for it has ended, then he must offer a compensatory sacrifice.\nWhatever the case, the jamarat overlap, meaning that if he omits all of them, or he omits stoning on one of the days of at-tashriq other than the third day – meaning that he did not stone the jamarat on the eleventh day or the twelfth day, or he omitted one jamrah, meaning seven pebbles, or he omitted four pebbles, or five pebbles, or three pebbles – then he must offer a compensatory sacrifice. End quote from Fatawa Nur ‘ala ad-Darb.\nBased on that, if the adhan was given for Maghrib before you stoned the middle jamrah or the largest one, then you must offer a compensatory sacrifice. The same is also required of your father. So you can delegate someone to slaughter two sheep on your behalf in Makkah, and distribute the meat among the poor of Makkah.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/342926/ruling-on-one-who-stoned-the-jamarat-during-the-adhan-of-maghrib-or-after-that-on-the-thirteenth-of-dhul-hijjah
270561,"I am a young Egyptian man who is about to get married. We have a bad custom in Egypt which is called al-qa’imah (the list), where the list is made of everything that the husband and wife have bought, and if the husband divorces his wife, he returns to her all the things that are written in the list. My question is: we agreed to buy 30 g of gold, and the bride’s family agreed to that, but that is on condition that 70 g be written in the list. Please note that the marriage is not done according to our custom until after this list has been drawn up. Is this permissible?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe mahr (dowry) is the right of the wife, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And give the women [upon marriage] their [bridal] gifts graciously}\xa0[an-Nisa’ 4:4].\nWhat is meant by {graciously} is an obligatory gift given willingly, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to one who wanted to get married: “Go and look for something, even if it is a ring of iron.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (5121) and Muslim (1425).\nThere is nothing wrong with the dowry being gold or cash or furniture, to be given immediately or at a later date, or some of it to be given immediately and some of it at a later date, according to what the husband and the woman’s guardian have agreed upon.\nIf you bought 30 g of gold, and the bride’s family want to wrote down 70 g of gold, there is nothing wrong with that. What it means is that 40 g of the mahr is to be paid at a later date.\nSecondly:\nThe custom in some countries is to buy furniture for the house with the husband’s wealth and the wealth of the wife’s family, then write that in the list as part of the woman’s mahr, then if divorce occurs, the woman takes what is in the list. There is nothing wrong with that either.\nSimilarly, there is nothing wrong with writing in the list something that is not yet present, so it will be a debt and mahr to be given at a later date.\nIf the furniture is made part of the mahr, then it belongs to the wife, and the fact that she brings it to the marital home means that she is giving permission to the husband to use it, but if any part of it is damaged, the husband does not have to replace it.\nIf divorce occurs, then she has the right to take this furniture as it is at the time of the divorce, and to take anything else that is written in the list, even if it has not yet been received, because it is part of the mahr to be given at a later date, as explained above.\nIt says in Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah (19/39): What is the Islamic ruling on the so-called list (al-qa’imah), which in our tradition should be written in the marriage document, and includes movable items that the groom brought or did not bring, and it is said that this serves an interest, because people are no longer honest, by analogy with the marriage certificate?\nAnswer: If the matter is as described, there is nothing wrong with mentioning them in the marriage certificate and both spouses signing for that, so that if any dispute arises that necessitates khul‘ (separation), what the husband gave will be clear and there will be no ambiguity concerning it. And Allah is the source of strength. May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.\nPermanent Committee for Academic Research and Ifta’\nShaykh ‘Abdullah ibn Qa‘ud, Shaykh ‘Abdullah ibn Ghadyan, Shaykh ‘Abd ar-Razzaaq ‘Afifi, Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn ‘Abdillah ibn Baz. End quote.\nIf a custom or tradition is not contrary to Islamic teachings, there is nothing wrong with following it.\nPerhaps the origin of this custom goes back to the well-known view in the Maliki madhhab which requires the wife to equip and furnish the marital home from her dowry, which they call ash-shawrah, and the husband has the right to make use of what the woman brings, and that he is not obliged to replace it [if it becomes damaged].\nAl-Hattab (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Mawahib al-Jalil (4/185): He may make use of her shawrah.\nWe have noted above that the shawrah is the furnishings and equipment that are needed in the home.\nWhat has been mentioned above about making use of her shawrah is correct. It says in ash-Shamil: He may make use of her shawrah, which is bought with her mahr, if she is obliged to provide furnishings and equipment for the home from her mahr, otherwise she does not have to do that. End quote. It is as if he is referring to what is mentioned in at-Tawdih and quoted by the author of ash-Shamil in Sharh al-Mukhtasar, that this ruling is based on the well-known view that the woman is obliged to provide furnishings and equipment for the home from her mahr. However, according to the odd view, she is not required to do so. End quote.\nAl-Khurashi said in Sharh Mukhtasar Khalil (4/187): It is permissible for the man to make use of the woman’s shawrah that she brought to the house and brought to his place, such as blankets, furnishings, clothing and so on. And he is not obliged to replace it.\nIn other words, the husband is not obliged to replace the first shawrah; rather he is obliged to provide that which she cannot do without.

111889,Is making the last prostration of the prayer lengthy for the purpose of offering supplication Sunnah? As many imams do that.,"['Praise be to Allah.Making the last prostration of the prayer lengthy for the purpose of offering supplication is not Sunnah; rather it is contrary to the Sunnah.\nAl-Bukhari (792) and Muslim (471) narrated that al-Bara’ ibn ‘Azib (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The prayer of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), his bowing, when he lifted his head from bowing, his prostration and his (sitting) between the two prostrations were almost all equal in length.\nShaykh Muhammad ibn Salih al-‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: With regard to making the last prostration longer than the other essential parts of the prayer, in order to offer supplication and pray for forgiveness in it, is there any problem with the prayer if the last prostration is made lengthy?\nHe replied:\nMaking the last prostration of the prayer lengthy is not Sunnah, because the Sunnah is to make all the actions of the prayer similar in length: bowing, rising from bowing, prostrating, and sitting between the two prostrations, as al-Bara’ ibn ‘Azib (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I observed the prayer of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and I noticed that his standing, his bowing, his prostration, and his sitting between the tasleem and departure were almost all equal in length. This is what is best. But there is a place for supplication other than prostration, namely the tashahhud. When the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) taught ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud the tashahhud, he said: “Then let him [the worshipper] choose whatever supplication he likes.” So he can make the supplication short or long, after reciting the final tashahhud and before saying the taslim. End quote.\nFatawa Nur ‘ala ad-Darb (tape no. 376, side B).\nShaykh ‘Abdullah al-Jibrin (may Allah preserve him) said:\nI do not see any evidence, and I have not read anything to suggest that the last prostration of the prayer should be made lengthy. But perhaps some imams do that to alert people to the fact that this is the end of the prayer, or the last action of the prayer, so they make it lengthy in order for people to realise that the sitting for the last tashahhud is approaching. If that is the case, it is not sufficient justification for making it lengthy. End quote.\nFatawa ash-Shaykh Ibn Jibrin: Ahkam Qat‘ as-Salah, Fatwa no. 2046), from his website.\nIn Fatawa Islamiyyah (1/258), he (may Allah preserve him) said:\nI do not recall any evidence to suggest that the last prostration should be made lengthy. Rather the hadiths speak of making all the essential parts of the prayer equal in length or almost equal in length.
