244044,"A man used to shorten his prayers when travelling, and he even used to shorten Maghrib prayer. Now that he has come to know that Maghrib prayer cannot be shortened, he is confused regarding what he should do about the Maghrib prayers that he shortened. Should he repeat the Maghrib prayers only, as now he does not know how many times he travelled?","['Praise be to Allah.Maghrib prayer cannot be shortened when travelling, according to the consensus of the Muslims. Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIt is permissible to shorten Zuhr, ‘Asr and ‘Isha’ when travelling, but it is not permissible to shorten Fajr or Maghrib, and it is not permissible to shorten prayers when not travelling. There is scholarly consensus on all of that.""(Al-Majmu‘\xa0 4/322).\nIf someone used to shorten Maghrib when travelling out of ignorance, he must repent from having fallen short in learning what is required of him, but does he have to repeat the prayers he offered?\nThere are two views concerning that among the scholars:\nThe first view is that he does not have to repeat the prayers, as he is excused because of his ignorance.\nThe second view is that he must make up the Maghrib prayers that he shortened, because they are not valid. This was the view of a number of jurists. If he does not know the number of prayers, he should pray as many as he thinks most likely to be required to absolve himself.\nThe view that is more likely to be correct regarding that is that the one who was ignorant is not required to repeat his prayers, as is proven in the Sunnah in many instances. This is the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him).\nPlease see the answers to question\xa0no. 45648\xa0.\nIf you make up these prayers, by way of erring on the side of caution and so as to avoid differing with the scholars who said that it is obligatory to make them up, that is a good idea and is more likely to absolve you of responsibility.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/244044/he-used-to-shorten-maghrib-prayer-when-travelling-out-of-ignorance-does-he-have-to-repeat-those-prayers
102851,"I have a serious problem. I was learning more about Islam, but now, as exams are drawing near, I am developing unutterable doubts and confusion. What I mean is doubts such as: was Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) really a prophet? And things of this nature. I can no longer focus on my studies. Please advise me.","['Praise be to Allah.It is good that you are worried about yourself, it is good that you are upset about what you are suffering from, and it is good that you have written to us, asking for advice. This indicates that your heart is alert and cautious. We ask Allah to help you to do that which pleases Him.\nIssues related to Devilish whispers in Islam\nThis state in which you find yourself is what is called OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder). We would like to reassure you and lift your spirits by noting the following:\n\nThese whispers have no implications, and no rulings are based on them. Therefore no divorce is valid, no oath is binding, no state of purity is rendered invalid, and no Muslim becomes an apostate if the whispers have to do with some fundamentals of belief. So if a person is overwhelmed with whispers to the point that he begins to doubt the existence of Allah or his belief in the Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), none of that has any impact on him, and the ruling of his being a Muslim remains valid. Therefore you may rest assured, and let the devil die in his distress and suppression.\n\nAbu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has forgiven my Ummah for whatever whispers [Waswasah] cross their minds so long as they do not act upon it or speak of it.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 2391, and Muslim, 127)\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“What we may understand is that there is no blame for what crosses a person’s mind, unless it is translated into actions or words as a result of that thought. What is meant by whispers is when a thought resides in a person’s mind without him feeling happy with it, or it takes root in his mind.” (Fat-h Al-Bari, 5/161)\nFor some important details mentioned by Shaykh Al-’Uthaymin, please see the answer to question no.\xa010160 , where he stated that no harm will befall a Muslim if he experiences compulsive whispers about Allah and His existence, or about His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) or His religion.\n\nThese whispers are indicative – in sha Allah – of strong faith and certainty, because of which the devil is eager to subject you to this Waswasah . Were it not that he sees that you have strong faith and are righteous, he would not have resorted to this method of whispering, especially since you regard as abhorrent the thoughts that he is trying to instil in your mind.\n\nWe are not saying that just to be nice to you; rather this is what the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) stated, and it is what the trustworthy scholars of this Ummah understood from the Hadiths.\nAbu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The devil may come to one of you and say: ‘Who created such and such, who created such and such?’ Until he says to him: ‘Who created your Lord? ’ If it goes that far, let him seek refuge with Allah and stop (such thoughts).” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 3102, and Muslim, 134).\nAccording to a report narrated by Muslim, “…let him say, ‘I believe in Allah and His Messenger.’”\nAccording to another report from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), he said: Some of the companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came and asked him: We find in our hearts thoughts that are too awful for any of us to speak of them. He said: “Do you really find that?” They said: Yes. He said: “That is [a sign of] clear faith.”.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“What this means is that the devil only resorts to whispering to those whom he despairs of ever misleading. So he tries to annoy them with his whispers, because he is unable to misguide them. As for the disbeliever, he can lead him in any direction he wants, and in that case he is not limited to whispering; rather he toys with him however he wishes. This is what the Hadith means: the cause of the Waswasah is strong faith or, in other words, Waswasah is indicative of a person’s strong faith. This is the view favoured by Al-Qadi `Iyad.” (Sharh Muslim, 2/154)\nHow to get rid of Devilish whispers\nThe remedy for this Waswasah is very simple. All you have to do is adhere to the instructions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to stop going along with those whispers, ignore them , seek refuge with Allah , say “I believe in Allah,” and distract yourself from it by glorifying Allah, may He be Exalted, remembering Him and calling upon Him, and sending blessings upon the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“With regard to the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “let him seek refuge with Allah and stop (such thoughts)”, what is meant is: If he is faced with these whispers, let him turn to Allah, may He be Exalted, to help him ward off this evil. He should stop thinking about it and should realise that this thought is one of the whispers of the Shaytaan , who is only trying to corrupt him and mislead him. So let him stop listening to these whispers and hasten to put a stop to it by focusing on something else. And Allah knows best.” (Sharh Muslim, 2/155-156)\nThe scholars of the Standing Committee were asked:\nI am a young Muslim man who has recently become religiously committed, and the Shaytan is causing me a great deal of trouble. Every time I manage to overcome one thing, he presents me with another obstacle. After I attained a level of religious commitment and I thought – praise be to Allah – that I was a little better than those around me, I began to see those who I had thought were less committed than me as now being better than me, and doing more righteous deeds than me; I look at myself and I find myself to be going downhill fast, drifting away from the level of commitment that I had achieved. I am trying to resist my evil inclinations and the Shaytan by all possible means, but I cannot find anyone who appreciates my pain and the suffering that I am enduring silently, or anyone I can talk to about the evil thoughts that the Shaytan is putting into my mind. These whispers do not leave me even for a minute, no matter what I do or where I am, in the mosque, in the street, at home or in school. Is there anyone who could stand by me and help me against this Shaytan? Is there anyone whom Allah might inspire to help me?\nThey replied:\n“We advise you to ignore these whispers and to pay no attention to them, to read a great deal of Quran, do a lot of righteous deeds, and turn to Allah, beseeching Him and calling upon Him to ward off from you the tricks of the Shaytan, to make you steadfast in adhering to the truth, and to guide you. For He, may He be Glorified, is in control of all creatures, both jinn and humans, and He directs them as He wills.\xa0\nBeware of being filled with self-admiration because of your worship , or being deceived by your good behaviour and conduct or your many righteous deeds.\nWhen it comes to matters of worship and issues connected to the Hereafter, do not look at those who are less than you, for that will lead to you developing self-admiration and will cause you to do fewer righteous deeds and to become slow in doing them; it will cause the Shaytan to toy with you and discourage you from doing good. Rather you should look at those who are better than you in adhering to the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\xa0\nCling to that and be keen to adhere to it, for that will motivate you to increase your righteous deeds and help you to attain the forgiveness and mercy of Allah, and a high position in Paradise, and everlasting bliss. Perhaps Allah will make you steadfast in adhering to the truth and will guide you to the straight path, and will relieve you of this Waswasah.\nWe also advise you to read the book Talbis Iblis, by Abu Al-Faraj ibn Al-Jawzi, in which he discusses this issue. We hope that Allah will benefit you thereby.” (Shaykh `Abd Al-`Azeez ibn Baz, Shaykh `Abd Ar-Razzaq `Afeefi, Shaykh `Abdullah ibn Ghadyan, Shaykh `Abdullah ibn Qa`ud, Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 2/194)\nYou should not worry, after reading these glad tidings and reassuring words, for all you have to do now is follow the advice of the scholars, which is based on the advice of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). We ask Allah to protect you from the Shaytaan and to make what is good easy for you, wherever it may be.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/102851/how-to-get-rid-of-devilish-whispers
265015,"I did wudu, after which I put on socks so that I could wipe over them. When I woke up for Fajr prayer, I felt unwell and was unable to do wudu with water, so I did tayammum and prayed Fajr, and I completed my wudu by wiping over the socks. Is my completing it by wiping over the socks valid?","['Praise be to Allah.If someone puts on khuffs after doing a complete wudu, he may wipe over them within the timeframe that is allowed, which is one day and night for one who is not travelling, and three days for one who is travelling.\nHe does not have to take the khuffs off until that period ends, or he finds himself in a state of major impurity, in which case he must take them off when he wants to purify himself (ghusl). It was narrated from ‘Abd ar-Rahman ibn Abi Bakrah, from his father, that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) granted a concession to travellers: if a traveller did wudu and put on khuffs, then he invalidated his wudu, he could wipe over the khuffs for three days and nights; the non-traveller could do so for one day and one night.\nNarrated by Ibn Majah (556) and others.

59911,Is Islamic `Aqidah a theoretical method or a practical method? What books can we read to learn about `Aqidah? How can we apply `Aqidah in real life? What are the ways of learning `Aqidah? Is doing one Islamic thing and not another (such as praying but not giving Zakah or not lowering the gaze etc) regarded as a fault in one’s `Aqidah? Do the Muslims nowadays need someone to teach them `Aqidah?,"[""Praise be to Allah.Is Islamic `Aqidah Theoretical?\nIslamic `Aqidah is not a theoretical and philosophical method; action is an essential part of this `Aqidah. Hence the Ahl As-Sunnah agreed that faith consists of words and deeds, or speaking with the tongue, believing in the heart and acting with the physical faculties.\xa0\nWhoever believes in Allah as his Lord and God, will worship Him and obey Him by praying, giving Zakah and so on.\xa0\nWhoever believes in the Last Day and its reckoning and reward or punishment, will be motivated thereby to do that which Allah has commanded and abstain from that which He has forbidden.\xa0\nWhoever believes that Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the Messenger of Allah will therefore obey him, follow his Sunnah and propagate his religion. \xa0\nThus the principles in which a person believes are translated into actions and words and efforts. The stronger that faith grows in his heart, the more its effects will be seen outwardly.\xa0\nHence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “In the body there is a piece of flesh which, if it is sound, the entire body will be sound, and if it is corrupt, the entire body will be corrupt. It is the heart.” Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 52; Muslim, 1599)\nAl-Hasan Al-Basri (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Faith is not the matter of wishes or outward appearances, rather it is that which settles in the heart and is confirmed by one's actions.”\xa0\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\xa0\n“If the heart is sound in terms of faith, knowledge and feelings, then this will inevitably lead to the soundness of physical actions, such as verbal statements and deeds. As the leading scholars of Hadith said: Words and deeds, both inward and outward. What is outward must follow what is inward, so if what is inward is sound then what is outward will also be sound, and if it (the former) is corrupt, (the latter) will also be corrupt. Hence one of the Companions said concerning the one who prayed carelessly: If his heart had been humble and focused, his body would have been humble and focused.” (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 7/187)\nBooks on `Aqidah\nWith regard to books which one may read about `Aqidah , there are many, the greatest of which are the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), in which there is protection and salvation for those who adhere closely to them. The scholars were concerned with explaining and propagating sound `Aqidah , and they wrote innumerable books on this topic. Among the most famous of these books are the following:\xa0\n\nAs-Sunnah by `Abdullah ibn Ahmad ibn Hanbal\nAt-Tawhid by Ibn Khuzaymah\nSharh Usul I`tiqad Ahl As-Sunnah by Al-Lalka’i\n`Aqidat As-Salaf wa As-hab Al-Hadith by Al-Sabuni\nAl-`Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah by Ibn Taymiyah [available in English translation]\nAl-`Aqidah Al-Tahhawiyyah wa Sharhuha by Ibn Abu Al-`Izz Al-Hanafi\nLawami` Al-Anwar Al-Bahiyyah by Al-Safarini\nMa`arij Al-Qubul by Hafiz Hakami\nAl-Irshad ila Sahih Al-I`tiqad by Shaykh Salih Al-Fawzan – this is an easy and useful book.\xa0\n\nHow to apply `Aqidah in real life\nWith regard to applying this `Aqidah in real life, this is done by learning it, propagating it, calling others to it, and refuting those who go against it with wisdom and beautiful preaching. This is how `Aqidah is spread and its effects made manifest so that all people may benefit from it.\xa0\nHow to learn `Aqidah\nThe way in which `Aqidah may be learned is to learn it directly from those who believe in it and act accordingly. This is the soundest and best way for those who are able to do it. For those who are far away from scholars, they should refer to their commentaries, writings and tapes, as well as asking about confusing matters and anything they do not understand.\xa0\nIf a person follows some of the teachings of Islam and neglects others, by failing to do some of the obligatory duties or by committing some of the acts that are forbidden, this is a shortcoming in his faith and a weakness in his belief and his love for his Lord and His religion. This is undoubtedly a fault in his `Aqidah.\xa0\nHence one of the basic principles of Ahl As-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah is that faith increases by doing acts of worship and decreases by doing acts of sin. These shortcomings and faults may erase faith altogether, so that the person becomes an apostate from Islam, such as if he stops praying. Please see question no.\xa05208 \xa0and\xa02182 .\xa0\nWith regard to sins that do not reach the level of disbelief, such as withholding obligatory Zakah or looking at prohibited things and so on, these are things which cause faith to decrease.\xa0\nWhat is the correct `Aqidah?\nThe Muslims need people to explain pure, correct `Aqidah to them, that is based on the Quran and Sunnah according to the understanding of the righteous Salaf. That is because of the widespread existence of ignorance, innovations (Bid’ah), myths and deviant schools of thought.\xa0\nEvery Muslim must be sincere towards himself first of all, by learning correct `Aqidah from trustworthy sources, then by propagating it and teaching it to the people, by means of lessons and lectures, books, publications and magazines, thus fulfilling the duty to convey the message as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\xa0\n“(And remember) when Allah took a covenant from those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) to make it (the news of the coming of Prophet Muhammad and the religious knowledge) known and clear to mankind, and not to hide it.” [Al-`Imran 3:187]\xa0\n“Let there arise out of you a group of people inviting to all that is good (Islam), enjoining Al-Ma‘roof (i.e. Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam orders one to do) and forbidding Al-Munkar (polytheism and disbelief and all that Islam has forbidden). And it is they who are the successful.” [Al `Imran 3:104]\xa0\n“Say (O Muhammad): ‘This is my way; I invite unto Allah (i.e. to the Oneness of Allah — Islamic Monotheism) with sure knowledge, I and whosoever follows me (also must invite others to Allah, i.e. to the Oneness of Allah — Islamic Monotheism with sure knowledge). And Glorified and Exalted be Allah (above all that they associate as partners with Him). And I am not of the Mushrikun (polytheists, pagans, idolaters and disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah; those who worship others along with Allah or set up rivals or partners to Allah.)’”\xa0[Yusuf 12:108]\nAnd Allah knows best.""]",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/59911/is-islamic-aqidah-theoretical
