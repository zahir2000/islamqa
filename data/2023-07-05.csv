135314,Is there a supplication that will protect you against a sudden death? What is it?,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nSudden death is one of the things that Allah decrees for some of His slaves, meaning that death comes to a person suddenly, without any respite or warning; rather it comes out of the blue and his soul is taken smoothly, without suffering the agonies of death and its precursors.\nThis is one of the ways of death that have existed since ancient times and has increased in modern times, because of the traffic accidents that are well known today, and the launching of war against peoples and individuals with efficient modern killing machines.\nIn some reports and hadiths it says that the spread of sudden death is one of the signs of the Hour. These reports were classed as hasan by al-Hafiz as-Sakhawi in al-Maqasid al-Hasanah (p. 506). He said: It has many chains of narration which strengthen one another. It was also classed as hasan by al-Albani in as-Silsilah as-Sahihah (5/370); you can read it in the book Ithaf al-Jama‘ah bima jaa’a fi’l-Fitan wa’l-Malahim wa Ashrat as-Sa‘ah (2/236) by Shaykh Hammud at-Tuwaijri.\nSecondly:\nMoreover, a sudden death may be a good thing, or it may be a bad thing, depending on the condition of the one who dies and his standing before Allah, may He be glorified and exalted:\n1.\xa0If the one who dies is one who is righteous and good, with a track record of good deeds and righteous deeds to his credit, which gives hope that he will have a light before him on the Day of Resurrection, then in his case all kinds of death are good, whether it is a sudden death or it comes after suffering the agonies of death. A sudden death is a mercy, kindness and pardon from the Lord of mankind, so he does not experience the pain of dying and the anguish of its agonies, and he does not suffer much sickness. If he experiences that suffering, and his death is not sudden, that will be an expiation for his bad deeds, and will raise him in status before Allah. That is a confirmation of what the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said about the affair of the believer being entirely good, and that the death of the believer is a relief for him from the toil and misery of this world, as it takes him to the bliss of the hereafter.\n2.\xa0But if the one who dies was one of those who fall short in their duties to Allah, or he was an evildoer, oppresser or disbeliever, then in his case a sudden death is a kind of punishment and divine wrath, because death was hastened for him before he could repent, and he was not given any respite so that he could make up for his past negligence and shortcomings. Rather he was snatched by way of punishment and as a result of divine wrath, as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) described it when he said: “Sudden death is a seizing by (divine) wrath.” Narrated by Abu Dawud (3110).\nBecause it is difficult to judge whether one is righteous or is falling short, and people vary in that regard, and some people may go through experiences that make them more pious and increase their fear of Allah, or make them more steadfast and more certain, we find in the reports from the early generations that they had different views regarding sudden death. In the case of one whose fear of Allah is uppermost, and he thinks that he is falling short in his religious duties, he will seek refuge with Allah from sudden death and will hope that Allah will expiate his sins by causing him to go through the agonies of death, whereas in the case of one whose hope of Allah’s vast mercy is uppermost, he will see sudden death as a relief and mercy, and pardon from Allah, may He be glorified and exalted.\nSo when we read what the early generations said about sudden death, it will appear to be contradictory, but in reality there is no contradiction; rather it is two different, valid views.\nIt was narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud and ‘A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with them both) said:\nIt is punishment for the evildoer and relief for the believer – meaning sudden death.""(Musannaf Ibn Abi Shaybah (3/370); as-Sunan al-Kubra (3/379).\nIt was narrated that Tamim ibn Salamah said: A man among us died suddenly and one of the companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him} said that it was a sign of divine wrath. I mentioned that to Ibrahim – and we rarely asked Ibrahim a question but we found an answer with him – and he said: They disliked a sudden death that appeared to be a sign of divine wrath.""(Musannaf Ibn Abi Shaybah\xa0 3/370).\nThirdly:\nWith regard to the marfu‘ hadiths [those that are attributed directly to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)], none of them are sahih except the hadith quoted above, “Sudden death is a seizing by (divine) wrath,” even though some scholars had some reservations about it. Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) suggested that it was narrated via both marfu‘ and mawquf isnads, and he said that Imam al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) indicated that there were some reservations about its\xa0 isnad. See: Fath al-Bari by al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (3/254).\nAs for other hadiths which speak of sudden death as being something praiseworthy or blameworthy, and suggest that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to seek refuge with Allah from it, none of them are sahih.\nHence al-Fayruzabadi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nNothing is proven concerning that.""(Safar as-Sa‘adah\xa0 p. 353).\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\nFourthly:\nThere is no specific supplication for protection against a sudden death that has been narrated soundly from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). What is widely disseminated in chat rooms about a supplication for which the reward of 360 Hajjs will be recorded for the one who says it, and it will protect him from a sudden death, and so on, is false and fabricated, and has no basis in the books of Sunnah. We have previously explained that in the answer to question no. 126635 .\nIt is best for a person to recite the supplication that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to recite:\nIt was narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said:\nOne of the supplications of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was: “Allahumma inni a‘udhu bika min zawali ni‘matika wa tahawwuli ‘aafiyatika wa fuja’ati niqmatika wa jami‘i sakhatika (O Allah, I seek refuge with You from the withdrawing of Your blessing, and the loss of good health, the sudden onset of Your wrath, and anything that may lead to Your displeasure).”\nNarrated by Muslim (2739).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/135314/is-there-a-specific-supplication-for-protection-against-a-sudden-death
172497,"I proposed marriage to a woman, but when I saw her she was very shy, to the extent that I could not see her face because she was so shy. Question 1: is it permissible for me to ask the family of the woman to let me see her and sit and talk to her before completing the agreement and getting engaged? 2. Is it permissible to pray istikharah regarding more than one woman, meaning that I saw two girls for the purpose of marriage, and I like both of them, but I need to pray istikharah to decide which of them is best for me? 3. How should I choose a wife, from the point of view of beauty, lineage and religious commitment?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt is permissible for the suitor to look at the woman to whom he wants to propose marriage, and sit with her and talk to her, even if that happens more than once, so long as he is undecided and his aim is to reach a definitive conclusion, and make sure that both parties are happy to proceed with the marriage. However, it is stipulated that this should take place without them being alone together, and that any conversation is limited to permissible and regular topics.\nOnce he has decided to go ahead with the proposal or not, then the ruling reverts to the original, which is that it is prohibited to look at her, because the reason for it being permitted no longer applies.\nThis is indicated by the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “If one of you proposes to a woman, then if he is able to see that which will encourage him to go ahead and marry her, let him do so.” Narrated by Abu Dawud (2082); classed as hasan by al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar in Fath al-Bari (9/181).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is permissible to look at her repeatedly… If on the first occasion he did not find anything that would encourage him to marry her, he may look a second time and a third. ""(Ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘\xa0 12/21).\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is permissible for a man, if he wants to propose to a woman, to speak to her and look at her, without being alone with her… And if his conversation with her is to do with marriage, housing and her character, to find out whether she knows about such and such, then there is nothing wrong with that, if he wants to propose to her.""(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa\xa0 20/429).\nIn al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (22/17) it says: It is permissible to look repeatedly, if need be, to find out how she looks, so that he will not have any regrets after marriage, because usually this purpose is not achieved with the first glance.\nPlease see the answer to question no. 13791 .\nSecondly:\nThe basic principle regarding istikharah prayer is that it has to do with one matter, which the person may either do or not do.\nTherefore you must decide and choose one of the two options, then pray istikharah based on that choice, and go ahead with the matter. Then if it does not work out for you, then you may pray istikharah again about the second girl, and so on.\nIf you pray istikharah separately for each girl, there is nothing wrong with that. Please see the answer to question no. 130169 .\nThirdly:\nThe Sunnah describes the characteristics of the woman whom a man should be keen to marry, which may be summed up as follows: she should be a virgin, religiously committed, of good lineage, beautiful, and wealthy. That is because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Women may be married for four things: their wealth, their lineage, their beauty and their religious commitment. Choose the one who is religiously-committed, may your hands be rubbed with dust (i.e., may you prosper).” Narrated by al-Bukhari (4802) and Muslim (1466).\nIf the woman has all of these qualities, then that is even better, otherwise you should give priority to the most important of them, and the most important of them is that she should be religiously committed and righteous, as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “This world is no more than temporary joys, and the best temporary joy of this world is a righteous wife.” Narrated by Muslim (1467).\nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: It was said to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): Which kind of woman is best?\nHe said: “The one who makes (her husband) happy when he looks at her, obeys him when he tells her to do something, and does not disobey him with regard to herself or her wealth in a way that he dislikes.” Narrated by an-Nasa’i (7373); classed as hasan by al-Albani in as-Silsilah as-Sahihah (1838).\nSee also the answers to questions no. 72255 , 125907 ,and 96584 .\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/172497/ruling-on-seeing-the-woman-one-wants-to-propose-to-more-than-once-and-sitting-with-her
311131,"I am fifty-four years old, and I want to get married. My beard is white; if I dye it some colour other than black, will that be deceiving the woman and her family?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt is recommended to change grey and white hairs with something other than black, because of the hadith of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The Jews and Christians do not dye their hair, so be different from them.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (5899).\nIt was narrated that Jaabir (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Abu Quhafah was brought on the day of the Conquest of Makkah, and his hair and beard were white like hyssop. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Change this with something, but avoid black.” Narrated by Muslim (2102).\nSecondly:\nIt is not permissible to cheat and deceive when proposing marriage, which includes dying grey or white hairs with black, or something close to it, so as to conceal the matter and make people think that there are no grey or white hairs, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever deceives (people) does not belong to me.” Narrated by Muslim (102).\nAn-Nafrawi al-Maliki (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIt is disliked to dye with black hair that is not black, for any purpose that is not prescribed according to Islamic teachings…\nBut if that is done for the purpose of deceit, such as when wanting to marry a woman, there is no doubt that it is prohibited…\nThen he explained what is meant by black being allowed by saying: There is nothing wrong with dying the hair with henna for the length of time that is required to redden the hair, and with katam, which is the leaves of the sullam plant, which turn the hair yellow…\nRather it is disliked to dye the hair with black, unlike other colours, because it is changing it from one colour to another, with the loss of the first colour, in contrast to dyes like henna, because the first colour does not disappear completely; rather it is changed, so no one will be deceived about grey hair if someone has dyed it red or yellow.""(Al-Fawakih ad-Dawani\xa0 2/307-308).\nIt says in Matalib Uli’n-Nuha (1/89): It is disliked to change grey or white hairs with black in situations other than war, and it is prohibited if that is done for the purpose of deceit.

130169,"I am a Saudi student in Canada, and I want to complete my master’s degree in engineering. But I am confused about which of five master’s specialties to choose. They are: 1- Urban Planning 2- Urban Design 3- Housing 4- Real Estate Development 5- Urban Management. My question is: should I pray istikharah once and mention all of the specialties [in the supplication], or should I pray istikharah five times in a row, once for each specialty?","['Praise be to Allah.The meaning of istikharah is that the Muslim asks his Lord to choose for him the one of two things that will be better for him in his both his spiritual and worldly affairs.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhat is meant by istikharah is seeking the better of two things.""(Sharh Riyadh as-Salihin\xa0 p. 792).\nHe said in Taj al-‘Arus (11/250):\nIn the hadith of istikharah, it says “Allahumma khir li (O Allah, choose for me), meaning: choose for me the better and most appropriate for me of the two things. End quote.\nThe basic principle regarding istikharah prayer is that it has to do with one matter, which the person may either do or not do.\nBased on that, you have to examine these options, think them over, and consult people of experience, knowledge and reason, until you settle on one thing, then pray istikharah regarding it.\nAn-Nawawi said: It is recommended, before praying istikharah, to consult someone who is known to be sincere, compassionate and experienced, and who is trustworthy in terms of his religious commitment and knowledge. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {and consult them in the matter} [Al ‘Imran 3:159].

And if he is thinking of not doing it, then let him pray istikharah and seek Allah’s guidance about not doing it. But if he has a number of options, then first of all – after consulting trustworthy people of knowledge and specialists – he should choose only one of these options, then if he wants to do it, he should pray istikharah before going ahead.
